At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected, especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year over year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76.","With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model.","In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago, and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.","We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.","Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to high-volume analog and logic. Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Power management was about even, and high-performance analog declined.","Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to microcontrollers and connectivity. Processors declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results, as this quarter's revenue is also a record.","In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6%, and inventory decreased by less than one week to just below four weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program.","Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive remained strong, with all sectors growing and three of the five sectors growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even, with about half of the 14 sectors growing and about half declining. Personal electronics was up because of demand from one customer. Excluding that one customer, personal electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by wireless infrastructure, which was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did grow sequentially. And, finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors.","We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days sequentially. This reduction was the combination of lower factory starts, as well as higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. As our business model evolves, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you in our capital management call next February.","Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of five-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%.","On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing-12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity, as discussed in our capital management call earlier this year.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested into the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt requirements.","In September, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.04 per share, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.14 billion. Total cash returned in past 12 months was $4.23 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments, with TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%. And this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year.","In summary, we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. I guess for the first one, I'm a little curious, when you said demand was weak but the revenue was strong, and then you mentioned that industrial \u2013 I think you said, Dave, was even year on year but was stronger than you expected. If you could just give us some more color around the demand environment, because you have such wide exposure, what is better or worse versus three months ago, and what does it really mean that demand is weak but your revenue is strong?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah. Well, what we were saying, Vivek, is that if you look, our revenue declined 2% from a year ago, and we obviously would describe that as a weak demand. That's actually similar to what we saw last quarter. But, inside of that, certainly it was stronger than what we had expected. There were a couple of areas that were stronger than we had expected. Wireless infrastructure and industrial were both stronger than what we had expected. So that's really what we're trying to say. We continue to operate in what we would consider to be just a weaker macroeconomic environment, and that's where we came in.","Do you have a follow-up?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thanks, Dave. On gross margin, I understand that sequentially they were sort of flattish, because I assume you took some utilization down. But why are they sort of flat to down versus last year? Because I assume throughout this year, there's been a mix shift towards your core Analog\/Embedded markets and a mix shift I guess towards more 300-millimeter capacity. So why aren't gross margins up versus last year?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Vivek, the short answer is that our wafer starts were down in the quarter versus last quarter and also versus last year, and so underutilization was a little bit higher than it was a year ago.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Okay. Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong result. Kevin, just to follow-up on that gross margin comment. So utilization went down in the third quarter. I know you're saying you're going to update us on your inventory targets, but I think the one that's outstanding right now is about $105 million to $115 million, and you got there pretty quickly sequentially. So I'm kind of curious, how do I think about utilization going into the December quarter, and what kind of impact should I expect on the gross margin line?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, John, as we look into the fourth quarter, we're expecting our wafer starts will probably be roughly flat to what they were this quarter, so no significant change in starts there. And keep in mind that the wafers that we start in fourth quarter, other than for the first few weeks of the quarter, are mostly for what we expect in follow-on quarters. So we build quite a bit forward to our expectation of when that inventory actually gets sold.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. And then, Kevin, as my follow-up, you guys probably were one of the first to start the trend of M&A with the acquisition of National several years back. There's been a lot of speculation in the marketplace about more M&A within the semi space. I know you've talked about this in the past, but I'd kind of be curious about kind of getting some updated thoughts from your perspective about the advantage from here given your already-hefty scale of M&A and how you guys are sort of thinking about that?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, John. So I guess it'll take me a second to kind of go through those thoughts there. Of course we acquired National back into 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate four attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may, in fact, be impacting some of their thinking about how they approach their markets. And those four attributes are our approach to low-cost manufacturing and advanced technology; the sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio; the reach we have to our customers through our market channels, especially with arguably the largest sales force of anybody out there; and the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have.","When we look at what most companies are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them may be changing their focus, and some of them may be trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage, and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being Analog and Embedded Processing. So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.","When we do think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long-term returns and excess free cash flows. So we really do focus on the numbers that that acquisition might lead us to. And by strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. If we were to look at an acquisition, it would probably be a company that's going to be broad in catalog, have a diverse customer base, have a large percentage of its revenue coming from industrial and automotive, probably have a very talented R&D team. Those would be the sort of attributes we'd look at from a strategic standpoint.","From a return standpoint, we'd look at several metrics, including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost of capital within, say, four years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire can continue to expand our cash flow.","So, with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor company \u2013 I know you don't like to hear it that way \u2013 but through our own stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those shares, we're getting a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions of those shares, and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees. And just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with the Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I'd like to follow up on the industrial market. You said half of your markets were kind of up year over year; half of them were down. That's pretty similar to \u2013 the same as last quarter, but you do seem to be seeing upside versus expectations. Within industrial, can you give us some idea of which end markets you're actually seeing relative strength versus weakness versus those expectations? And talk a little bit about how your end markets within industrial are concentrated or not.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so great question, Stacy. We've got 14 different sectors that make up our industrial market. And I'll just go through some of those, because I think some investors, if they focus on industrials \u2013 we mean something different than that. So it includes things like factory automation and control, medical and healthcare, building automation, smart grid and energy, test and measurement, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliance, power delivery systems, point-of-sale lighting, industrial transportation. And then a bucket of just other really small stuff.","So last year, as you know, Stacy, industrial was 31% of our revenues. The largest sector inside of there was 4%. So you can see it gets very, very diverse very quickly. And even inside of each of those sectors we've got multiple end equipments that make each of those up. So it was very similar to last quarter, where we did see about half of the sectors up and the other sectors down, together flat. So there weren't really any really huge movements in either that we would call out to say that it was unusual. So that's what it looked like.","Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I do. Thank you. Around your OpEx, it seems like you came in fairly light in the quarter versus expectations. Why was that, and where do you see OpEx going next quarter?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","So, Stacy, on OpEx \u2013 if you compare it to a year-ago-quarter, that was really when we just had continued cost management going on across the company, and we also had the benefit on a year-ago comparison to the actions that we previously announced in Embedded Processing and Japan. And those are now done. So we get that benefit year over year. As it relates to sequential, even, as you say, coming into the quarter a little bit better than expected, that's really just cost management continuing. And also in second quarter there were a few items that didn't recur in second and third quarter, and so that gave us a good little benefit second to third.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to our next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In Q2, Embedded was up year over year for the first time. Actually, no, Q2 Embedded was down year over year for the first time, I think, versus the prior 10 quarters. It inflected higher in Q3. I know you guys said MCU and connectivity drove the growth, but what end markets helped to return this business back to year-over-year growth? And also what drove the 450 basis point improvement in operating margins?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Okay. So I guess two questions there. I'll take the first one. So, as you said, Embedded Processing was driven by microcontrollers and connectivity, and both of those businesses tend to be very broad market exposures, a high exposure to industrial. We also have some exposure inside of processors to automotive. And what drove the weakness in second quarter and the reason why processors declined year over year was the exposure to wireless infrastructure, is probably the simplest way to say that.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","On operating margin, Harlan, the short answer is we had announced at the end of 2012 some restructuring actions inside Embedded Processing that would wind up last year, and in fact they have. So a lot of that cost is out, and so as a result their operating margins are coming through very nicely.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, yeah. Nice job on -","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","And we'll let you squeeze in a third question, but we'll make an exception for you on this one.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that. Last quarter you guys indicated you were bringing down utilizations in the third quarter to try and reduce inventories. Looks like you guys executed to that. Should we anticipate gross margins in Q4 down in line with the lower utilizations in Q3?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Harlan, I'm not going to try to forecast individual lines of the P&L, but I'll just bring you back to what I had mentioned when John asked his question. We expect utilization to decline \u2013 pardon me, utilization to be about \u2013 excuse me, starts to be about even in fourth quarter versus third quarter, so we don't expect starts to actually change. The starts were already down third quarter versus second and third quarter versus a year-ago quarter, and we'll maintain those starts about even going into fourth quarter.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah, and the other \u2013 certainly the other consideration with fourth quarter is what happens to revenue overall. So we'll have less revenue, so that'll impact gross margins. Okay. Thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys. So if we look at just some sort of normal or reasonable projections for Q4, for 2015 your revenue's going be flat but your gross margins will be up and your OpEx will be down. If we assume the sort of bleah environment continues into 2016 and revenue is sort of whatever, around the flattish or something like that, is there any way that gross margins could go up and OpEx go down again? Can you just kind of take us through the puts and pulls for next year on those?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, I'll go ahead and take you through on those sort of things, Chris. First off, I'm hoping that you're wrong in your theory about revenue being flat again next year.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Me, too. I want to keep my job.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","But under that scenario, I doubt that we'd see a whole lot of change in operating expenditures other than just normal annual pay and benefit increases. But on the margin side, on the gross margin side, we'd probably continue to see benefit as we see more and more of our production moving to 300 millimeter, which as you recall gives us about a 40% chip cost production from an overall cost of goods standpoint, so that will certainly benefit our gross margin line. In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial and automotive space as a percent of the total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins, as well as just overall catalog products versus custom products inside our mix.","And then the last item is that, as we talked about for a couple years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close. In fact, you can even see that gap closing just in this past 12-month comparison period. So as we look out into 2016, you'll see that gap close a bit more. So those in combination will give us continued tailwind on the gross margin line. Should fall all the way through to the operating margin.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, and I'd just add, too, that even with this year, if the revenue projections come in as you said, Chris, that our free cash flow margin continued to expand, and that's really what we're focused on.","Do you have a follow-up, Chris?","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. So if we look at what revenue did sequentially in Q3 and what you're projecting for in Q4, it's pretty even with last year. So \u2013 and it sounds like even though business is still kind of bleah, it's getting a little bit better. Would you characterize the environment overall as kind of normal? And if it's not normal, then where would be your biggest area of concern or weakness?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, Chris, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it would suggest that our revenues would be down 2% from the year-ago. That's similar to the number that we just turned in, as well as what we saw in second quarter. So we just described the environment really hasn't changed very much. We just believe that we're operating in a weak macro environment. And we continue to focus on execution, and I think the business is showing the results of that focus and the strength of the business model. But, in general, that's really what we believe that we're operating in.","So, okay. Thanks, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you had a 10% customer in the quarter or if you had any meaningful change in revenue from a single customer that would have affected the overall trend in the business during the quarter?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, Will, when we had \u2013 if we look at last year, we had \u2013 our largest customer was 8% of revenue. And we don't give customer size by quarter, but we expect that that customer, as they've done well this year, that they could come in around 10% of our revenue. And I'd say this: As we look at that customer, we sell them hundreds of devices across multiple products. And if I contrasted that to the last time that we had a customer that was more than 10%, most of that revenue was concentrated in just a few parts and a single application. And even more specifically than that, it was really one function that maybe was that different generation. So we really just had one function at that customer. So even inside of this customer we've got quite a bit of diversity.","Do you have a follow-on, Will?","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, it's sort of related to this. The company exited the wireless apps processor and baseband business a few years ago. And I suppose the answer is around the concentration at the part number level, but does what looks like a growing exposure to the handset market through at least one but probably multiple customers \u2013 does that concern the company, the way that \u2013 in a similar way that caused you to exit some products previously?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Will, I'd say that when you heard Dave's opening remarks that we saw growth in personal electronics and without that one customer growing, personal electronics would've been down, I think that's also telling us that as handsets overall grow, they're really becoming the larger piece of the personal electronics space. And so what's important is to have a lot of different chips that you're selling into, a lot of different customers who sell into that space, and that's exactly what we have.","And so from that standpoint, if we're going to participate in personal electronics, you're going to be a \u2013 participating in handsets, and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunities inside handsets, unlike what we had a number of years ago, as you remembered, with baseband and processors, where those parts were basically standardizing and commoditizing, and your ability to differentiate was diminished and therefore your ability to attract profits from selling those parts was diminished. And so consequently, I see this as quite a bit different today given the diversity of products that we're talking about here than the example of when we were baseband and processors five-plus years ago.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, and I'd add to that, if you look across personal electronics and you add smartphones and tablets and PCs and TVs and things like that, you're probably \u2013 if you added all those together, you're probably scaring (30:15) 2.4 billion, 2.5 billion units. And even though that unit pool probably isn't going to grow much, there's \u2013 as Kevin said, there's opportunities to find products that will live through multiple generations that you can sell to multiple customers and places where we'll continue to try to steer our investments overall.","So thank you, Will, and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Really two related questions. One, I just \u2013 a clarification. You said the upside in the quarter came from wireless infrastructure and industrial. It seems like HVAL was up a lot. Was that part of what you're calling industrial? And then maybe bigger picture, from a geographic perspective, there's obviously been some negative data points in kind of the U.S. industrial market. Just any change \u2013 over the summer it was China, now you're seeing some U.S. issues. Just any perspective from a geographic basis. Thanks.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Okay. So let me answer your first question, which if you look at HVAL, HVAL will have a high exposure to automotive, which will help drive those revenues. It'll also have exposure to personal electronics as well. It does have some industrial exposure, but I think that those are the areas that will drive that revenue. And you had a follow-up?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The question was just what you're seeing from a geographic perspective. Obviously China was weak \u2013 yeah.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, if I just look at our regional results year over year, revenue was down in Asia, in Europe, and U.S. In Japan, it was up. If you look at the broader China market, it really wasn't down differently than what the broader Asia was, and that was kind of down consistent with our overall revenue. So really didn't see much different.","The second thing I'll add is that, a lot of times we're asked by investors what our exposure to China is or to a particular market, and in our 10-K we give a very precise number of what we ship into, China being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking how much of our product is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44%. It's much lower than that, because obviously some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions.","I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China. So you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So \u2013 but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP, and kind of start an analysis from there.","So, okay. Thank you, Blayne, and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your customer inventories. You gave us the very helpful disti resale and inventory numbers, but just in general, you had a pretty good year in 2014, a weaker year this year, but my perception is that the customer inventory management, lead time, days held hasn't really changed. Can you just talk about whether you've seen any inflection there in the last few quarters?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Sure, Joe. I'd say that of course the distribution inventories, as you said, that we can see very well, we've got 55% of our revenues that are on consignment. So for those portions, which will include 60% of our distributor revenue, but we know for that portion of our revenue there is no inventory, so it's actually zero. So obviously that's in really good shape. And if you look overall, the classic kind of booked\/shipped carrying inventory type portion of our revenue is really about 20% of our revenue. And that's where we'll carry backlog, customers will have inventory. So we really don't see any signs that customer inventories are significantly out of whack. I'm sure you can always find pockets here and there. But we believe that they're fairly lean with very few exceptions, such as the wireless infrastructure.","So do you have any follow-ons, Joe?","Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, and I did want to follow up on wireless infrastructure. You said it was up sequentially, recovering from a lower level. Do you have visibility into whether that's sort of China deployments or Western deployments? And what do you see as the trajectory for that business going forward?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so, Joe, we have \u2013 I'd say that our exposure in wireless infrastructure, if you look at the major OEMs that make up the majority of that market, we'll have a different product exposure, but a fairly consistent exposure across them. So if there's demand in any of the regions, we'll typically participate in that. If you look at by technology \u2013 that's oftentimes another cut that people will look at \u2013 we've got a strong position in 3G, a slightly stronger position in 4G. And even in newer areas that we expect growth in the future that we've been investing in, as an example like small cells, we've been investing and believe we'll have a very strong position there as well. So our numbers aren't so much impacted by a specific region. Of course, we won't escape it either if there's weakness in any particular region.","So, okay. Thank you, Joe. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong results. I know in the past, Dave, you gave the year-over-years. I think you mentioned that the wireless infrastructure sequentially was up. I was hoping you could give the sequential direction by the other markets, and I think from the math you gave earlier, for last year, by the end markets, it seemed to imply that the combination of industrial and your comm infrastructure, your wireless infrastructure, must have been up the better part of 15% sequentially. So if you could just comment on the directional color by segment and if those magnitudes are anywhere close, that would be helpful.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Okay. Yeah, so I can share with you some color sequentially. The automotive market grew sequentially, led by our ADAS and infotainment sectors. Industrial, again, was about even. And personal electronics was up, with growth in most of the sectors that make up that market. Communications equipment was, up as we talked about earlier, due to wireless infrastructure. And enterprise systems was about even. So \u2013 and, as we talked about, most of those areas were stronger than we had expected, but specifically wireless infrastructure and industrial.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, just on the year-over-year growth, though, I'm not sure, Ross, on the numbers you were reciting there, but industrial overall year over year was probably only up about 1%. And then wireless -","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, I'm sorry. I was talking sequentially.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Okay. Yeah, because wireless infrastructure is still down year over year. Sequential industrial was actually down about 1% overall. And then wireless infrastructure was, again, up in single digits. So really not much growth there.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah. Okay. And do you have a follow-up, Ross?","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, just a quick one, more housekeeping. I know you're not going to give exact guidance on the gross margin you said earlier, but as far as OpEx directionally in the fourth quarter and first quarter, I know you guys tend to have some year-end phenomenons that impact that. So, Kevin, any sort of color on those two quarters would be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Ross, it's going to be pretty normal to what you've seen in past quarters. Your memory is quite correct on that. 4Q is typically down low to mid-single digits percentage-wise, just because of seasonality of holidays around Thanksgiving and Christmas. And then first quarter is typically up in a reverse direction. Again, because of the absence of holidays and also because of the implementation of our annual pay and benefits increases. So I think that if you look at the past couple of years, 3Q to 4Q to 1Q, that's probably the best proxy for you to try to model into your spreadsheets for now.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, okay. Thank you, Ross. And we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. This is Erik calling in for Tore. A lot of questions have been asked, but going back to the 300-millimeter strategy, can you give us an update on that exiting the year, maybe how much of Analog would you expect to be coming out of the fabs to support that?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Hey, Erik. I'll just say that we'll give an update to that in our February capital management call. I can just say that part of our plan was to qualify our DMOS6 factory, so that qualification is planned to be done before the end of the year. And so we're still tracking to that. And we've been releasing products to RFAB, or the Richardson fab, for some time, so we're going to continue to do that. And we still have quite a bit of capacity to be able to grow into.","So do you have a follow-on?","Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no, thank you. That's helpful. The Embedded Processing, obviously the operating margins looked very good this quarter. Going forward \u2013 and I know you probably don't want to give too much guidance on this \u2013 but what are the expectations for this business? Will it be lumpy in terms of the improvements? Was this a little bit more of an outsized quarter in terms of the improvement, or should we see \u2013 what are some of the expectations for that group?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Erik, I'll just tell you, that team's been working pretty hard for a number of years now to grow their revenue. We've talked about their mission over the last couple of years has really been cost containment and growing the revenue, and they are achieving very good results on that now. Importantly, they're a strong contributor to our free cash flow growth. And just as our free cash flow at the company level tends to be weaker in the first couple quarters and stronger in the second couple of quarters, I don't think it's any different than when we take a look at how some of the business units underneath will perform on that metric, being as they're the ones contributing to that free cash flow.","We tend to look at these things over a longer period of times, because quarter to quarter can be pretty noisy. But I think that team has done a very good job of getting its margins up to where we think its entitlement is at, and they should be performing at that level for the foreseeable future \u2013 in fact the long term is what we expect out of them.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah. And I'll just add that, as Kevin mentioned, the growth has been coming through from the investments that we've made. We highlighted that they, as well as Analog, had achieved record levels of revenue as a result of those investments. Together Analog and Embedded have grown for nine quarters in a row year over year. So \u2013 and I think there was one quarter where Embedded actually did well but didn't grow year over year, and that was last quarter that had the big headwind from wireless infrastructure. But the other parts of that business obviously did very well.","Okay. I think we have time for one last caller. Operator?","Operator","And we'll take our last question from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Just a detail of your earlier answer. You noted personal electronics was up because of demand from one customer. What about your broader segments? Would you still have seen year-over-year growth in both Analog and Embedded if it hadn't been for that same one customer?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, I actually don't have that data broken out between the two segments, but I think that personal electronics is mostly inside of Analog. And so our personal electronics business without that customer obviously wasn't up. So that would have impacted Analog.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Well, let me remind you the other side of that, too, in that we had a significant change in foreign exchange rates at the beginning of (44:03) the year. And so actually in the third quarter, and I think again in the fourth quarter, we saw and expected about a $35 million negative top line impact due to foreign exchange rates. So we can always pick out individual pieces. The beauty of the TI model is that we have tens of thousands of customers buying tens of thousands of parts into almost every electrical and electronic market that's out there, and the diversity is what is really paying off for shareholders in free cash flow generation.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","That's good -","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","And I guess you don't have follow-up, David?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, actually one quick one. As you move more to 300 millimeters, are you vacating any specific 200-millimeter facilities you might be able to close down or sell eventually?","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, David, we've put in place that 300-millimeter capacity in the Richardson fab and put together the plans inside of DMOS6, the second 300-millimeter factory, to be able to support growth. That's why that's there. It's really releasing new products into those factories. And that's what they're there for, and that'll help us maximize free cash flow.","Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations","So, okay, well, thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us. I was expecting Marty McFly to actually get in the queue, but he didn't. So a replay of this call is available, and you can find it on our new and improved website.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and yearend earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","The fourth quarter was a good one and wraps up a good year. We are entering the first quarter of 2014 feeling better than we did entering the first quarter of 2013. Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that is important to your calendars.","Starting this quarter, we will not be providing a mid-quarter update to our outlook. Our business is now sufficiently diverse across markets and customers that we believe a mid-quarter update is no longer necessary. The diversity in our business means that TI\u2019s results should mostly reflect broader industry tech trends as opposed to TI\u2019s specific considerations such as adjustments in demand from a large customer. In fact, in our last eight updates, we narrowed to the middle of the range six times on a revenue basis.","We do plan to hold a call on March 13 to update you on our capital management strategy. This will be a follow-on to the call we did a year ago on this topic. In this call, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequent questions that we are asked about this strategy. More details will be forthcoming.","Revenue in the fourth quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. Once again cash generation and returns remained strong. Free cash flow was $3 billion or 24% of revenue for the trailing 12 months period, or in this case, the full year of 2013. Over that same period, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. This return was 136% of free cash flow for the year. Again our strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to our shareholders except what is needed to repay debt.","EPS was at midpoint of our range. However it also included $0.03 of charges for a restructuring action that was not previously included in our guidance. So overall a good quarter.","The restructuring that is underway is a result of our ongoing assessment of our investments and the market opportunities that we are addressing with those investments. First, we are reducing costs in certain embedded processing product lines that either have matured or do not offer the return opportunities we are looking for. These changes will accelerate a profit margin improvement in the embedded business while still maintaining its pace of growth.","Of note that we are not exiting any markets or discontinuing any existing products but are aligning resources consistent with our updated views of the market opportunities.","We are also lowering costs in Japan by reducing resources in that country to levels that are appropriate to the opportunity. Combined, these actions are expected to result in annualized savings of about $130 million by the end of 2014. As a result of these actions, we will eliminate about 1100 jobs.","Total charges are estimated to be about $80 million where $49 million included in the fourth quarter results and the remaining charges of about $30 million to be included in the first quarter. These charges are recognized in the other segment.","In the fourth quarter results, TI revenue grew 2% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 10% with double digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% with half of the declines due to seasonally lower calculated revenue.","Analog revenue grew 12% from a year ago and declined 3% sequentially. From a year ago, all four major product lines were up with power management leading the growth. Sequentially, all major product lines were down with high performance analog declining the most.","Embedded processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago and declined 10% sequentially. From a year ago, the growth was due to strengthened micro-controllers. Connectivity revenue grew a single-digit percentage rate and processors were about even. Sequentially, all areas were down with the biggest decline in processors.","In our other segment, revenue declined $209 million or 27% from a year ago. The decline was due to legacy wireless dropping $216 million. Sequentially, other revenue was down $90 million due to the seasonal decline in calculators. Legacy wireless revenue was $54 million in the fourth quarter and we expect it to be essentially gone in the first quarter.","Turning to distribution. Resales declined 3% sequentially, trending about the same as our semiconductor product revenue. Distributors\u2019 inventory levels were about even with the prior quarter.","Let me make a couple of observations about the year overall. For 2013, analog and embedded processing revenue grew a combined 4% with analog up 3% and embedded up 9%. These two key areas were 79% of TI revenue for the year, up from 72% in 2012.","Operating margin for analog was 25.8% and it exceeded 30% during the second half. Operating margin for embedded processing was 7.6%, a level that should increase as we continue to grow and as we execute our restructuring plans to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing.","Finally, we are refining descriptions of our end market mix to more closely match our perspective of our markets and investments. Traditionally, we and many other companies have described the markets as communications, computing, industrial, consumer, automotive and education. The real world didn\u2019t always align so cleanly and some of the categorizations became blurred. For example, consumer smartphones were included with infrastructure equipment in the communications market and consumer tablets were included with servers in the computing market. In both of these examples, high volume consumer products were grouped together with enterprise equipment that have very different life cycles and market characteristics.","We believe our revised segmentation is more description and reflective of the markets we sell into and therefore more helpful for our understanding of our business. Starting now we will provide an annual snapshot of our product mix along the following market descriptions. Industrial which is 24% of revenue in 2013; automotive which was 13% of revenue; personal electronics which was 37% of revenue and include subsets which we call sectors such as notebooks, tablets, mobile phones and consumer products.","Communications equipment which was 16% of revenue; enterprise systems which include sectors such as servers and projectors was 6% of revenue; and calculators which was 4% of revenue. We have matched [ph] our product revenue in these markets as well as the sectors and even in the equipment levels below that, we find this especially beneficial for the industrial markets where the market definition has historically not been very clear and where we have a strong strategic focus.","We now have a reasonably precise profile of where our revenue is shifting that is more accurate than we\u2019ve had in the past. We\u2019ve included on our website this 2013 product revenue breakout by market along with the 2011 and 2012 historical breakouts. We\u2019ve also identified the sectors below the markets provide you a clear understanding of how we are mapping the revenue. We will not be disclosing our revenue breakout below the market level. We plan to update this for you annually.","Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.64 billion, or 54.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 8% sequentially \u2013 about the same as the 7% decline in revenue. Gross margin held up very well, slipping only 60 basis points from last quarter\u2019s record high.","From a year ago, gross profit was up 13% \u2013 well above the 2% increase in revenue. The result was a 570 basis point expansion in gross margin. There are a couple of major reasons for gross profit expanding significantly faster than revenue.","First, the quality of our portfolio has improved as the higher proportion of our revenue is from Analog and Embedded Processing products. Second, our factory utilization has improved as we have increased loadings in our most advanced factories and we have shut down older, less-efficient manufacturing assets, such as our Houston and Hiji 6-inch factories.","Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $807 million was down $26 million sequentially and down $48 million from a year ago. The sequential decline is mostly due to seasonality, as employees typically take more vacation and holiday time in the fourth quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the wind down of our legacy wireless products.","Acquisition charges were $84 million, almost all of which is the on-going amortization of intangibles, a non-cash expense.","Restructuring and other charges were $62 million. This included a $49 million charge for the restructuring action that Ron discussed. This was not included in our prior guidance and negatively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share.","Operating profit was $687 million, or 22.7 % of revenue. Our tax rate in the quarter was 25%, a point above the 24% that we had guided. The effective tax rate remained 24% but we had several small discrete items that pulled the rate up in the quarter.","Net income in the fourth quarter was $511 million, or $0.46 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.20 billion in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $5 million compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days increased by 6 days to 112 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days.","Capital expenditures were $107 million in the quarter. I should note this includes our purchase of a 358,000 square foot assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China, that is adjacent to our existing wafer fab. We expect to have this facility equipped and in production by the fourth quarter of this year.","On a trailing 12 months basis, Cash flow from operations was $3.38 billion. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $412 million, or 3% of revenue. As a result, free cash flow was $2.97 billion, or 24% of revenue. This is within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue.","I\u2019ll note that depreciation expense for the full year was $879 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $467 million, or 3.8% of revenue. Over the next few years, as we continue to hold capital spending to low levels, depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margin will directly benefit.","And as we\u2019ve said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, TI paid $326 million in dividends and repurchased $734 million of our stock for a total return of $1.06 billion.","Our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders, except for what we need to repay debt. In the full year 2013, free cash flow was $2.97 billion and we reduced our debt level by $500 million. We returned a total of $4.04 billion to shareholders, or 136% of free cash flow. This return was 54% higher than in 2012. We returned more than our full free cash flow in the year because proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, totaling $1.31 billion in the year, have also been an additional source of cash for the company, all of which was used to repurchase stock.","There was an abnormally high level of exercises in the year due to the stock price performance. Although the exercises were somewhat of a headwind for the share count reduction, we more than offset this with stock repurchases. In the end, we reduced our shares outstanding by 25 million shares, or 2.3%, in 2013 similar to the last couple years. In total, we have reduced our share count by 37% since the beginning of 2005 with our repurchases.","Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.83 billion of cash and short-term investments with 82% of that amount owned by TI\u2019s U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely on-shore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.","TI\u2019s orders declined 10% sequentially and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.94.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 3% sequentially with most of the decline coming from the final step-down in legacy wireless revenue, which is now essentially gone and should not be a factor in the sequential trends after the first quarter. Therefore, if you exclude the legacy wireless revenue from the fourth quarter of 2013, revenue at the middle of this range would be almost even sequentially. If you exclude it from the first quarter of 2013, growth would be 10%",".","We expect first-quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.44, which includes a $0.02 EPS impact from the $30 million of restructuring charges discussed earlier. We expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to increase to 27% and this is the rate you should use in your models for the first quarter. This is about 3 percentage points higher than our 2013 effective tax rate, negatively impacting EPS by $0.02 in the first quarter. This rate is higher due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2013 and our forecast for higher profits in the year. Historically, the R&D tax credit has expired and was later reinstated retroactively to its expiration date.","In summary, we\u2019re encouraged that a lot of hard work at TI over the past few years is producing results. Today, we\u2019re a company firmly rooted in Analog and Embedded Processing \u2013 areas that have strong potential for growth and good profits that require low capital investments and, therefore, can generate a lot of cash.","Although much of the heavy lifting associated with the structural improvement at TI is now behind us, our work is not done. The restructuring action we discussed today is a result of an on-going process at TI of review and continuous improvement. This process helps ensure we focus our investments on opportunities that have the best potential for sustainable growth and returns.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","I guess, Ron, could you help me understand when you talk about these realignment actions, how big of a revenue pie did these costs kind of cover, and what was sort of the growth hurdle or the gross margin hurdle that you guys used to try to determine this sort of realignment of costs?","Ron Slaymaker","Well, I don't know that I can get into all of that detail, John. But clearly the embedded processing overall runs \u2013 I think last year was just about 20% of our revenue. The processor piece of that, I think we've probably communicated -- I can update it even for 2013 \u2013 was 50% of our revenue last year. And again, that's where, I would say, most of the actions in embedded processing are taking place. And again, it's primarily in processors. I would say secondarily, we're taking some action inside of microcontrollers as well. But processors was about half the revenue. And, of course, not all of processors has been affected, but certain product lines within that.","And then separately the action in Japan, last year Japan was about 9% of our total revenue. And again this is just more or less an action to. On one hand, we'll be consolidating some of the business activity that was previously in Japan just to other regions of the world where we can do it more efficiently. But then also we'll be effecting some of the sales and marketing activities in Japan, kind of to align those resources with that opportunity that we see in Japan going forward. So, do you have a follow-on, John?","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Yes, just relative to the new segmentation with personal electronics being 37%. I'm just kind of curious, should that be an area where we see future realignment or do you feel given your cost structure, you can still go after the growth in that market? Is that sort of acceptable returns? How do I think about that 37% over time as a percent of the mix?","Kevin March","John, I would say that \u2013 if you take a look at that on the website, you'll see that it\u2019s down a little bit year-over-year, and really what's going on there is the wind down of the legacy wireless. That's really the handset and the tablet space is coming down. We'll continue to be engaged in personal electronics, make no mistake about it. The biggest difference is that we'll be driving a lot more aggressively with our catalog products as opposed to custom products. And on the historical basis, the catalog products tend to have a much longer life to them and a much better margin profile to them than custom products do.","So there won't be any overt change to our approach to personal electronics. It will just wind down on its own because of the wind down in legacy wireless, that was the biggest driver of that.","Operator","And we will go next to Doug Freedman of RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Can you take a look or give us some insight into how far all of your acquisitions have been integrated? What you're talking about now on your restructuring front, it sounds like really end market related. Are there more efficiencies to be gained through further synergies that you might identify?","Kevin March","Doug, we haven't made an acquisition in a couple of years of any meaningful size and we've pretty much wound up the, if you will, the synergistic opportunities of that consolidation about a year ago now. So, there's not really much in the way of synergy as it relates to acquisitions going forward. What we're doing on this restructuring is just part of an ongoing exercise that we've actually done for a long time. They're usually of a smaller level, in this case, a little bit larger. But that's really looking at where we're spending our research dollars and looking at the market opportunity that those products from that research spend would go into.","In this case, we've got some of the markets have matured or about to mature, which means, we don't need to have as many teams designing new parts for it or in other cases, we may have invested in certain markets where we had anticipated better growth and return opportunities. But those initial expectations have since been changed for a variety of reasons. So, there's really no acquisition synergies that I can think of to suggest to you. This is just really an ongoing process of dealing with the reality of market changes over time.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have follow-on, Doug?","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes. My follow-up. There has been some concern in the industry as far as unit growth and the ability to grow revenue sort of above global GDP levels. We saw some interesting data out of the SIA recently showing some pretty steep declines in analog ASPs. Can you comment if you're seeing any change in the way either you or your competitors are approaching the business?","Ron Slaymaker","I don't know about competitors. But I can say that at TI, we have not reset our exceptions downward as you might be suggesting there from a growth standpoint. I think over the last few years global GDP has been certainly below normalized run rate and that certainly has affected our industry as well. But our view is that the markets that we serve being analog and embedded processing will likely grow on a unit basis. And frankly, from a revenue basis about 2x global GDP, we believe that for some time. Again, we're looking at longer term trends, not what happened over the last three years or even five years. Again, our view on that is unchanged.","Operator","We will go next to Christopher Danely of JPMorgan.","Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Just a question on the restructuring, how much of the cost savings will go into COGS versus OpEx and what do you think is going to be the revenue headwind by the end of the year in terms of taking these products out?","Kevin March","Chris, on the costs savings, again, we anticipate by the end of the year we'll be at about $130 million annualized cost savings as we exit the year. About 65% of that will probably be an R&D, about 20% in SG&A and about 15% in cost of revenue.","As it relates to revenue there should be no impact on revenue. We're not eliminating products, we're not discontinuing products. These are products that have very long lives. What we're really dealing with here is that the rate of change in those markets have matured now in most cases and it no longer makes sense to continue to invest or invest as heavily as we have because there's just not growth window there.","Ron Slaymaker","And Chris, many of these markets that we view are maturing, frankly, you could double, you could triple the investment and not affect the revenue level, not affect the growth rate just because the nature of what the market trend overall is doing. So again, let me just reiterate. We said in the prepared remarks, but \u2013 Kevin just said it, there are no products being discontinued and we're not exiting any markets with this action. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Yes. Can you guys just maybe give us kind of the status update on your end markets and what you expect to grow maybe the most personally [ph] the least for this year?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, I can do a part of that, which is the historical view. I don't think we want to try to extrapolate into a forecast for 2014. But let me just start with fourth quarter '13, and again, this information really is coming out of the database that I just grabbed we've put together for our new market framing. But again, fourth quarter, most end markets were down sequentially. The biggest driver of our revenue decline though was a seasonal decline in calculators. I think as we said before, that was half of the sequential dollar decline in the fourth quarter.","Outside of that, personal electronics declined the most, followed by enterprise systems and industrial; and all three of those areas declined at single-digit percentage rate. Automotive and communications equipment were each about even sequentially. Just a little more color on some of those areas. Industrial, we saw strength in appliances and industrial displays, but that strength was offset \u2013 more than offset actually by broad-based declines elsewhere. In enterprise systems, really we saw weakness or declines there due to servers.","And in personal electronics, we saw declines in TVs, gaming, and printers, and we saw strength sequentially in tablets. Moving to the full year 2013, industrial for TI, this is based for our revenue was up 7% that was driven by factory automation, building automation, appliances, medical and motor drive. Automotive was up 14% for TI in the year, driven by infotainment systems, as well as advanced driver assist systems and safety. Personal electronics revenue was down 18%, due to mobile phones and tablets as we wound down our legacy wireless business, followed by much smaller declines in other areas of personal electronics.","Communications infrastructure for the year was up 4%, driven by both wireless infrastructure and enterprise switching. Enterprise systems for the year was down 8%, driven by servers and projectors, and then calculators declined 3% for the year.","Operator","And we will go next to Blayne Curtis of Barclays.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","I apologize if you answered this already. The decline in embedded, you had expected decline in processors. Is that greater than you were expecting and what is your trajectory this year for that business?","Ron Slaymaker","Blayne, let me first of all get some data in front of me. We saw and it's \u2013 are you talking about the sequential trend in fourth quarter there?","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Sequential decline into the December quarter, it was down double-digits.","Ron Slaymaker","Yes. And so I don't \u2013 to be honest, I don't have the data here on our forecast. I can't say that was \u2013 I again reiterate it was down double-digits as was connectivity. Microcontrollers was down also but to a much lesser degree, but I don't have the forecast data on processors to be able to say what it did versus our expectations. Do you have a follow-on, Blayne?","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes. I think someone asked this already. But just looking at the March quarter sequentially, do you see any of your segments growing? And if so, which ones and would you point out any segments that are outside of calculators that are down a significant amount?","Ron Slaymaker","Again, calculators will be typically flattish in the fourth to first transition. That's their typical seasonal pattern anyway. The only area that we really said we expect an additional decline is in legacy wireless where it will go from $54 million in the fourth quarter to be essentially gone in the first quarter. I think we described that already. Outside of those two areas, we don't really have comments in terms of end market trends that we expect to evidence in first quarter.","Operator","And we will go next to Stephen Chin of UBS.","Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS Securities","First question is on your automotive segment. Based off of the strong 14% growth that you just mentioned for last year, I was wondering if you\u2019d any color from downstream customers on inventory levels and supply chain and especially given the, I think comments from AutoNation last week about relatively high automotive inventories in the U.S., any comments on momentum there in the first half of the year?","Ron Slaymaker","Steve, I don\u2019t \u2013 I probably don't have anything more that we would have from a \u2013 that would be a unique perspective that TI provides. When you have somebody talk like AutoNation talking about inventory of automobiles, you have that data, we don't have any unique perspective. That's several layers below where we're selling into that, that supply chain. I'll speak more broadly that we believe inventory seems to be pretty well managed currently, if not lean. You heard my comments on distribution. Distribution inventories remain below 5.5 weeks, which again are lean. But anything in terms of a particular supply chain like automotive, we really don't have that granularity. But again, our general sense is inventory is not at all an issue more broadly into the markets that we're serving. Do you have a follow-on, Stephen?","Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS Securities","Yes. My follow-up is on gross margins and sort of relative to where your inventory levels are currently. If I'm not mistaken, in prior quarters you were able to build a little bit of strategic inventories, some of your longer shelf life products? And just given where the inventory levels are currently, would it be safe to say that you would not continue to build any more strategic inventory?","Kevin March","Stephen, on the inventory, we just closed the quarter at about 112 days of inventory, which is consistent with the model that we have for ourselves of carrying between 105 days and 115 days. And specifically, if you look at our balance sheet, you'll notice that during the fourth quarter, we drained our work-in-process and our finished goods increased somewhat. That's just reloading the factories to meet the lowered outlook that we had in the fourth quarter.","We do expect in the first quarter to begin to reload the factories as we go forward. Inside that 112 days is the strategic inventory that you were talking about, which is our products that have long shelf lives, and we've been building that up for a couple of years now. And we'll continue to manage that at about these current levels.","Operator","And we will go next to Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Ron, can you talk \u2013 given the savings on the OpEx, can you talk a little bit about how OpEx is going to work its way through the year? Is there sort of anything out of the ordinary other than just how the $130 million gets \u2013 ratably impacts the P&L through the year?","Kevin March","Tim, let me go ahead and comment on that for Ron. The first thing to remember about OpEx is that it'll seasonally go up in first quarter. If you look over the last three or four years and just compute an average, you can see that on average we've probably got about 4% fourth quarter to first quarter. And you can expect an increase again in this first quarter as we start out 2014.","As we flow through the year, the cost savings that we talked about as a result of the restructuring actions will begin to show up in the second half of the year, and by the time we leave the year, we'll have \u2013 we'll be at about $130 million annualized savings rate at that breakout that I mentioned earlier across R&D, SG&A and cost of revenue.","Ron Slaymaker","Tim, do you have a follow-on?","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.","I do, yes. So, if I look at analog's share, you've been talking about SVA gaining share this year. And if you just take seasonal December for the SIA, it looks like your share in analog basically was flat in '13 versus '12. So, is there something that maybe might start to kick-in in 2014 that is going to cause analog to gain share year-over-year?","Ron Slaymaker","Well, we'll see how our 2014 rolls out. I guess for starters based on the WSTS data that's been released through November, we believe we actually gained a small amount of share in analog. And by the way, I should note if we just look over the last few years, I guess I have data since 2009 in front of me. On average, we've gained analog share at probably 30 basis points to 40 basis points on average per year. We've gained in every one of those years.","And the range has been pretty broad, I mean there were some years where we may be, I'll say, 10 basis points of gain and other years during that time period where we've gained over 100 basis points. So, I would say it's not necessarily a smooth curve in terms of market share gains, but at least it's consistent from the standpoint of what we believe we've gained share every year. And it's our expectation and our intention to continue doing that, including 2014.","By the way everything I think I just said there, I could also apply to embedded processing. Although I would also say that embedded processing probably in 2013, our share stepped up a little more strongly in embedded processing than it did in analog last year. But again, market share is important to us. Everything I've also described about our market share gains was on an organic basis, so it's not comprehending acquisitions and the impact of National anything like that, but again we've been gaining share consistently and we expect to continue that. I guess, that was your follow on, Tim.","Operator","And we will go to Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Recognizing it's a relatively small part of the business, are you managing the 8% year-over-year declines in servers as if that's a secular issue driven by server virtualization that some of the other companies have also highlighted, uniqueness in that area? Or do you think that was more of a cyclical issue in the sever market? Do you expect to bounce back in that area?","Kevin March","Well Jim, I'll comment on that. I can't specifically that we're managing servers by itself. We are looking at the entire compute space, notably hard disk drives for example. And noting what's been going on in total demand for hard disk drives and managing accordingly to what looks to be a secular decline as you pointed out Jim in that space. And so we've been adjusting our investment levels in that technology development and our staffing levels and so on to meet what we believe as a smaller market going forward than what we've seen in recent years.","Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","In terms of the M&A outlook, I know, you'd just mentioned that you haven't done a deal in a couple of years and obviously, you guys have been so good about doing these deals over the years and then you have integrated and potentially over time, you've looked at others. If you do not do a deal in the next couple of years, do you think it would be because you really don't find one that's for sale that makes sense or do you just really not think that incremental deals make sense regardless of whether they're available from here?","Kevin March","Jim, I'd say it's more the first, not the latter. That is, when we take a look at potential acquisitions, we look real hard at the numbers and we've got to be able to make sense of the numbers. Namely, we\u2019ve got to be able to get a return on that investment that exceeds our weighted average cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe, which we define as three years to four years. So, if we can't get past the numbers, then we just simply step aside and wait for an opportunity to come at a later date. So, really a numbers driven analysis as we look at M&A.","Operator","And we will go next to Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets-US","A question on the divergence and I know that every quarter both the businesses will not track around the same levels. But embedded was down a lot more on a Q-over-Q basis versus analog. What was driving that?","Ron Slaymaker","Ambrish, I think it's very similar to what you said. I don't know that it's just the markets that embedded sells into. In this case we noted that the processor area was down more than other areas. Obviously, you're going to have different customers, you're going to have different markets, but they're both very diverse businesses, but they're not uniformly consistent in terms of the customers, the markets that they're selling into. Beyond that, we don't have a specific color for you yet.","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets-US","Going back to the comments you made earlier on, at the top of the call, you mentioned that you're feeling a little more and I don't want to paraphrase the word, but the message was you're feeling better about 2014 than you did heading into 2013. Is that just to do with the new rationalized product portfolio or is that a comment based on what you're seeing from the end markets?","Ron Slaymaker","I think it's both to be honest. I'll make some comments, then Kevin probably has some things as to how he's feeling as well. But I'd say first of all, the strength and position of where we are today in analog and embedded is a big factor. Having those two product lines now making up 82% of our revenue going out of the year in the fourth quarter, frankly, is a great feeling and positions us \u2013 you know as well as any Ambrish, how long the wind-down of that wireless revenue was.","Having that wind-down behind us, such that the top line growth of the company can reflect lot of the good things that we're doing, a lot of the potential that analog and embedded have embedded in them is just great. I think also more specifically, the overall environment in terms of the markets that we're selling those products into, and frankly, just areas of strategic focus, such as we've said, industrial is really important to us. Automotive is really important to us. The strength of those markets and frankly our position in those markets, not that our position is so strong that it saturated, we like the fact that we have lots of headroom for growth and market share gains. But we also like the design position we have there.","And then maybe just a little more tactically, coming out of fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was strong, exiting the year than it was a year ago, and we also have good backlog coverage coming into the first quarter as well. So, those are the kinds of things that I know we look at. Kevin, do you have anything else you would add?","Kevin March","Yes, Ambrish, I'd probably just say, on a macro level, looking at the total economy, the U.S. economy clearly seems to be stepping up its growth, Europe appears to have stopped declining, and it appears that China has stabilized, and those are three big economic regions of the world. So you\u2019ve got to feel better about that at this stage, starting 2014 than we did 12 months ago starting 2013, with the uncertainty we're all staring at in those three economies.","And then again, a bit more tactically to what Ron was talking. If you look back a year ago, the sum of analog and embedded processing was 74% of TI, today it's 82%. A year ago, analog and embedded processing were down quarter-over-quarter, 9% on revenue in fourth quarter and flat year-over-year. Fast forward to this year and not only is analog and embedded processing bigger in percent and it's also bigger in dollar terms, it was only down 5% quarter-over-quarter and is up 12% year-over-year. So, we've got real momentum going, as we move into 2014. So, you take the macro look, you take a TI specific as the portfolio is finishing its restructuring, and you got to feel pretty good about how we're going to start 2014 and what the year might hope for us.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus.","Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","First, I had a capital management question. So, last year was pretty unusual $4 billion, and $1.3 billion I think you said came from stock option exercises. I know obviously you don't have a crystal ball on this. But could you just give us a rough sense as we look into 2014, what we can expect as far as free cash flow generation? And especially, maybe handicapping, the year's stock option exercises?","Kevin March","Tore, I do wish I had a crystal ball to help out with that particular question, but like you, I'm lacking on that right now. I would say that we would expect that the exercises are going to be lower next year than they were this past year. But I would also just put aside any concern about that because frankly, we just use the cash proceeds from those exercises to buy back shares. So it doesn't really impact what we've been able to do to share count for our stockholders.","I believe in early March, we're going to have -- as Ron mentioned, we're going to have a capital management strategy update and that will be a really good time to ask some of these questions. I'll take you a little deeper into some of what we're thinking on, on where we're going with capital management at that time.","Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Also do you have any CapEx and R&D estimates for the year? I know in the past, sometimes you've at least given the R&D guidance for the year. Just wondering if you can do that again this year.","Kevin March","Yes, but I'd say, going forward, you're not going to be getting that from us anymore, Tore. The CapEx guidance that we\u2019ll give you simply is a band that we talk about around our revenue, meaning that our target is 4% to 7% of revenue, on any one year. And we expect that \u2013 given the size of our manufacturing footprint today, we don't expect to be pushing above the lower end of the range. In other words, probably more around 4% of that range of revenue, until we hit about $18 billion of revenue.","So, from a CapEx guidance, that's how I'd suggest you -- you'll hear the modeling from us going forward, and not a specific number. And on R&D, frankly we're reaching a point now where it's pretty stable and it should probably just kind of grow with paying [ph] benefit increases over time and with the top line revenue growth over time. So, based upon that, we're not going to be providing R&D guidance going forward. You'll be able to just take a look at our results and it'll be pretty straightforward for you to model that going forward.","Ron Slaymaker","And I think, Tore, the other one I would comment on is, we've also historically given annual guidance for depreciation. But again given that depreciation is so gapped these days from CapEx and frankly, it's a multi-year lagging indicator versus our CapEx trend. So, it just doesn't seem to us to be an especially useful number and from a guidance standpoint and clearly you guys can go up and make some assumptions of what that may be just given what our capital spending trends have been.","Operator","We will take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Actually both my questions are about different end markets. So first on the wireless infrastructure market, if you could give us a sense for whether some of the restructuring you're doing on the processor side. Does that impact the ability to benefit from all these 4G LTE deployments, or am I just feeding too much into that, then there isn't; any connection in that case, what are the trends that you are seeing in that market?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Vivek, I would say that, first of all, we don't believe anything that we are doing here is going to impact our ability to benefit from LTE deployments. And again, a lot of those \u2013 and that does not mean that the base station area is not an area where we're seeing some resource reductions, it is. But just in general, LTE we are already very well positioned across those various customers, our system-on-a-chip products have been out in the market for some time. And so we just have a great position as LTE continues to deploy.","As to the comment -- let me just talk maybe more broadly and I'll start at the embedded processing level and then drill down into some of your comps infrastructure question. But let me say, again, just you heard us give the numbers, but embedded processing has really delivered strong growth this year. That came out of areas like catalog, microcontrollers, specifically product lines like the MSP430, the C2000. It came out of areas like connectivity, processors for automotive markets, processors for industrial markets. So, those areas that have been driving and producing growth, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we have in the past. The reductions that we're making are, as I said before, primarily processors, and then secondarily, in some of the product areas in MCU. So, within processors, I would identify areas like IP cameras and certain areas of communications infrastructure, or frankly, the future growth just doesn't merit our current levels of investment.","Now, to specifically \u2013 kind of your question about LTE and base stations more broadly, I guess I don't want to go into a lot of specifics there, except to say again, comms infrastructure is an area that will receive fewer resources. And it's based on our view that parts of the macro base station market are maturing. On the flip side, small cell is an emerging opportunity for us and we'll continue to invest accordingly there. But even in the maturing areas of base station, as I started off here, we believe our revenue will continue for a very long time given the breadth of our position and the long lives of the equipment that we're already engaged with there. So, hopefully that provides you some color as to what we're doing in comms infrastructure. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, Ron, actually I had thought about asking you about the PC market. But instead what I'll ask you is, in the market it's always about what have you done for me lately. And last year the TI story was about the benefits you got from exiting wireless, the really strong capital returns. And now I think for this year, what we're hearing is a sort of the same. So what is really the next catalyst that can help you either outflow the market or provide much superior returns than what we are seeing from the peer group? So, really, what is the value proposition for outsize invest for overweighting TI this year?","Kevin March","Well, Vivek, I think that there is a number of opportunities in front of us that we've got going on here. You've seen some pretty strong growth rates that we just talked about in the areas we've been focusing our attention on for a number of years now: analog and embedded processing. We talk about the fact that we're returning 100% of our free cash flow, that\u2019s what we use for debt. But we also have a plenty of room to grow with very little need to spend that much more to grow and I'm talking specifically about our manufacturing footprint.","If you take a look at the very cost-effective factories that we've put into play over the last couple of years and the low-level of CapEx that takes for us now to keep those factories going, the incremental margin and cash flow opportunity from those factories is extremely attractive. In addition to that, we've just got the overall growing space in industrial and automotive which tend to be not only quite long-lived revenue profiles, but also quite attractive margin profiles. Again, those products run across those inexpensive factories and just help generate ample amounts of cash. So, I think from an investor standpoint, there are quite a few things to continue to look forward to, which is really our ability to continue to grow at the kind of rates that we're doing now inside the analog and embedded processing and leveraging the very inexpensive factories we put in place to generate a lot of cash.","Ron Slaymaker","So, Vivek, let me make a couple of other comments. I think a lot of our long-term oriented investors clearly looked through the wireless transition, frankly, even over the last few years into what TI was becoming, and that was the value proposition for them; a company focused on very diverse markets of analog and embedded processing that didn't require a lot of capital, that generated a lot of cash and then, as you pointed out, they liked management's commitments to return that cash to them.","I would kind of take a different view from what you described with some of the other investors because investors \u2013 a lot of investors I've talked to last year, the year before, the year before, the response was, give me a -- we like what you're doing in wireless, give me a call when you're out of it and that no longer represents a headwind for your growth. So, for investors that have been sitting on the sideline, because of the concern that wireless represented such a significant headwind to growth, I think the value proposition for them is clear. It's no longer there and the growth that we've been producing in analog and embedded is no longer going to be an obstacle for top line growth and for a lot of those investors, that frankly our growth hasn't screened very well in the past, that's not going to be an issue going forward. So, just my two cents' worth on that topic.","Operator","And we will go next to Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Two quick ones. What would you say your new targets are if they've changed at all, for the growth rate in embedded as well as your operating margin goal in embedded given the restructuring actions?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. I would just say first of all, in terms of growth rate target, absolutely no change. Again, I think embedded did a good job on growth last year. Frankly, we would have liked to have seen that growth come through at a higher level of profitability overall for the business but growth has not been an issue. And to the extent that we've tried to describe for you, our investments in the areas that are growing in embedded will continue unabated. So, our expectations for a growth in embedded are absolutely unchanged. And I think you'll continue to see good results there.","In terms of profitability and margin objective, I guess what I would say, Ross, is I know we've provided some numbers in the past. But in fact, I'll say what we've said in the past because I'm sure you have them in your notes there. I think in September 2012 investor meeting, our manager there described that his growth margin targets were 55% to 60%; operating margin target was about 30%. What I would say is, in general, a well-run company focused on the embedded processing market opportunity, we think has potential for a financial profile consistent with those types of numbers.","That being said, I don't think \u2013 what we're going to do with this segment is very similar to what we've done for analog and not the communicating specific gross margin and operating margin targets and progress going forward. But again, clearly, our objectives are much higher than where that business ran last year and ran fourth quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I do. I can't let Kevin get away with the whole conference call without somebody asking about the gross margin. Kevin, any help on the puts and takes for the first quarter as we look at the gross margin? It seems to imply at the midpoints of everything that it's down a little bit, but just want to double check on that.","Kevin March","Ross, you're right, I won't give you specific guidance. But I'll give you some high level things to think about. Clearly as we came through the fourth quarter, we were taking our factory starts down through the quarter. As we go in the first quarter, we're taking our factory starts up, and that\u2019s on the expectation of a normally stronger second quarter for us. The result of that is going to be that while starts will be higher in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter, the average utilization won't really change that much. So just based upon that and the timing of moving the wafers through the factories and through the assembly test sites, we would probably see a little bit of gross margin headwind as we bring those factories back up, but not a large amount.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. With that, my clock shows that it is 5.30. So we are going to wrap up at this point. I'd like to thank you for joining us.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today.","For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.","Let me start with market environment. Revenue in the third quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. That being said, we expected revenue and demand to be weak, and they were. Similarly, our expectations is that this market weakness will carry forward into the fourth quarter as customers respond to the sluggish macro environment and to poor demand for their products. We continue to believe that inventory levels at OEMs and our distribution channels remain low. Although there could be some adjustments to inventory in light of weak demand, we believe this slowdown is being driven by poor end demand, not a broad inventory adjustment.","Even in the weak demand environment, our operations have performed well. We were highly responsive to changing demand and lowered our production loadings accordingly, resulting in lower TI inventory. We remain watchful and ready to respond to changes in demand, up or down, in this uncertain environment. Our lead times are short, our inventory is well-positioned and our factories are highly flexible. We also reduced expenses as we described at our September update.","EPS was $0.67 last quarter. This was favorably impacted by a couple of items in the quarter that Kevin will walk through in detail. These items include a benefit for taxes that contributed $0.14 to EPS and a benefit for changes that we made to our Japan pension program that contributed $0.08 to EPS. Neither of these items was comprehended in the guidance we had provided. In any event, we delivered a solid EPS result that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05, even allowing for these items.","We also generated a lot of cash in the quarter, with free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Kevin will describe how our opportunistic purchases of capacity over the past few years are now benefiting us on this front.","Let me now walk through the third quarter's results. Revenue of $3.39 billion declined 2% from a year ago and grew 2% sequentially. Analog revenue grew 18% from a year ago and was up 2% sequentially. The growth from a year ago was due to the acquisition of National Semiconductor late in the year-ago quarter. Therefore, the revenue comparison only included a week or so of this revenue in the year-ago quarter. The sequential growth was primarily driven by growth in High Volume Analog & Logic, as well as Power Management, offsetting declines in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog.","I should note that we will soon complete our IT systems integration work at SVA and will begin this quarter to implement a consignment inventory program with distribution on the SVA portfolio. As you will recall, we began to implement a consignment inventory program with distribution in 2008, and our experience has been good in that it creates supply chain efficiencies. In short, it allows the distributors' resources to be better optimized on revenue creation for TI products as a result of fewer resources being tied up in inventory carrying costs. For TI, we believe it translates to higher share at our distributors.","Revenue per products that are on consignment gets recognized as the distributors pull the products from the hub shortly before they ship to their customers. This means that as we convert part of the SVA portfolio to consignment, revenue recognition for these products will flip out about 2 or 3 months as distributors work down their existing inventory and then start pulling from the consignment hub. In total, about $100 million of SVA revenue will be impacted as we move these products to consignment support over a 2 to 3-quarter period. Since we recognize revenue on a sell-in basis to distribution, during this conversion process, the SVA revenue growth will be negatively impacted. Of course, this is only a timing consideration and will have no effect on resales. It will have minimal impact on TI's overall growth rate. However, it will have a more meaningful impact on SVA growth over this conversion period.","Embedded Processing declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure applications. Automotive and catalog products were both up from a year ago. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 2%, driven by catalog products as communications infrastructure products declined and automotive was even.","Wireless revenue declined 44% from a year ago and declined 5% sequentially. Baseband revenue was the biggest factor in both comparisons, falling to $54 million in the quarter. Connectivity revenue declined in both comparisons while OMAP revenue increased.","Our Other segment revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 3% sequentially. From a year ago, revenue declined due to lower DLP revenue, the expiration of transitional supply agreements and lower calculator revenue. The sequential increase was due to $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the quarter that we discussed in our September update, and that was included in our prior guidance. The sequential increase was also driven by higher royalties and calculator revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was lower DLP and custom ASIC revenue.","In distribution, resales were about even with the second quarter, and their TI inventory was essentially unchanged. Distributor's TI inventory remains at just under 6.5 weeks.","Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin P. March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, let me start by walking through some of the charges and benefits in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the third quarter were $106 million. In the prior quarter, acquisition charges were $104 million. We recorded charges on the restructuring charges and other line of our income statement of $22 million associated with the previously announced planned closure or potential sale of several older factories. In addition, we had a benefit on this same line of $144 million for change to a pension program in Japan.","Let me briefly explain the pension change. Defined contribution pension plans in Japan have historically provided for both a corporate pension benefit and a government-mandated Social Security type of benefit. The Japanese government has made an option available for companies that provide defined benefit pension plans to return to the government the mandated portion of the pension plan. Under the rules of this option, the pension liabilities we were required to return to the government exceeded the associated assets. The results -- this resulted in a gain to the company, which we recognized in the quarter.","Let me also address the tax benefit. There were a couple of parts to this. The first was a $90 million discrete tax benefit that was primarily the result of an additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2007 to 2011. The second part, a $67 million benefit, was due to lowering our estimated effective tax rate for the year from 26% to 22% and the associated cumulative adjustment. Most of these rate change was tied to an increase in the impact of non-U.S. effective tax rates, a change that should continue to benefit TI in the years ahead. The EPS impact on these items was as follows: the acquisition and restructuring charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.07 as we had expected; the tax items benefited EPS by $0.14 and the changes to our Japan pension program benefited EPS by $0.08.","Gross profit of $1.74 billion was 51.3% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially. Gross profit resulted from higher revenue, specifically due to the benefit that the $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds provided to our mix of revenue. Operating expenses of $916 million declined 2% from the second quarter. Other income and expense was $24 million of income this quarter, mostly attributable to gains from an equity investment. Net income in the third quarter was $784 million or $0.67 per share on a GAAP basis. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the third quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $14 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.69.","Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion, up $526 million from the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $1.05 billion, up $523 million from the prior quarter. Our free cash flow was benefiting from having operations that are already well positioned for future growth. Accordingly, capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter, up $3 million from the prior quarter. Our capital expenditures year-to-date are 4% of revenue, at the very low end of our targeted range of 4% to 7% of revenue. We believe we can continue to operate at the low end of this range for several years given our strong capacity position that resulted from our opportunistic purchases of the past few years. As we fill up this low-priced capacity, the resultant cash flow should be strong.","We used $500 million of cash to repay all of our remaining commercial paper in the quarter. We also issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, consisting of $750 million of 3-year notes at a coupon rate of 0.45% and $750 million of 7-year notes with a coupon rate of 1.65%. At the time we issued the debt, these were the lowest ever corporate coupons for notes of these durations. More than 2 months later, these records still hold. Given these historically low rates, we are confident that we will be able to generate solid shareholder returns over time by using these funds for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock. We repurchased more than twice the number of shares we bought in the prior quarter. We also paid dividends in the quarter of $194 million.","We lowered our inventory by $37 million in the quarter. Inventory days were unchanged at 101. Orders of $3.2 billion in the quarter decreased $171 million or 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.96 in the quarter from 1.02 last quarter.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 13% from the third quarter. Please remember that our calculated revenue typically seasonally declines in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect about a $100 million decline, which would negatively impact the company's growth by about 3 percentage points. Also, the $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the third quarter was the final Japan earthquake settlement, which, therefore, will not recur. This additionally impacts our fourth quarter growth by a couple of percentage points.","We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.31. We expect the fourth quarter's EPS results will be negatively affected by about $0.06 from acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%. For the year, our estimate for R&D expense remains $1.9 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures has been lowered to about $500 million from our prior estimate of $700 million. We estimate -- effective tax rate has been reduced to 22%, down from our prior estimate of 26%.","In summary, our market has weakened, and we expect it will remain so in the fourth quarter as the overall world economy continues to be soft. Especially in this environment, our operations have executed well as we have reduced inventory and lowered expenses in the quarter. Our business model is now focused to squarely on Analog and Embedded Processing, 2 markets with proven histories of solid cash flows and investment returns.","We realized there are questions regarding our plans for OMAP and Connectivity products sold into the smartphone and tablets spaces. I can tell you, we are actively working on these plans, but at this point in time, we don't have anything new to share with you.","Our free cash flow in excess of $1 billion in the third quarter is a testament both to the business model and to the benefits of our opportunistic purchases of manufacturing equipment over the past few years. The benefits to our shareholders of this business model and as long-term cash generation potential are very tangible as we repurchased $600 million of common stock in the quarter, pay dividends of $194 million and announced a 24% increase in our dividend rate. We remain focused on delivering to this potential.","With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  We will take our first question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess the question is kind of a strategic one to start, which is that understanding that a lot of the capacity you have is very strategic and that it's not going to go obsolete. How much lower would the cycle have to get or how much longer would the cycle have to stay at these depressed levels before the company would thinking about -- would think about, taking actions to mitigate some of the short-term capacity and maybe put some margin leverage back in the model?","Kevin P. March","Jim, we don't have any more plans to take any more capacity offline than what we already announced. And what we announced back in the first quarter on the general earnings release was that we would be closing 2 older factories. That's the one in Hiji, Japan and one in Houston, Texas. We expect the factories to close late in the first half of 2013, one of them, and the other one early in the second half of 2013. Right now, our focus is on maintaining the state-of-the-art factories because frankly, their cost is quite low and go ahead and take these older, less economically advantaged factories offline. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, if I could, I'm sorry if I missed it during the prepared remarks. But the factory loadings in Q4 and\/or any thoughts about inventory for Q4?","Kevin P. March","The factory loadings in Q3 declined quarter-over-quarter, and so consequently, our underutilization charges did increase. With our reduced outlook for fourth quarter, we're further reducing our factory loadings into the fourth quarter. I won't predict where our inventory actually lands at, but I will point out that we do expect the factory loadings to decrease further in the fourth quarter, which also means our underutilization charges are expected to increase in the fourth quarter as well.","Operator","Our next caller is CJ Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide some color around gross margin and OpEx. And I guess within that, you talked about an effective tax rate for the full year of 22% now. So we'd be thinking therefore around 32% in Q4 or if you can provide some help there as well?","Kevin P. March","CJ, there's a couple of things in them, let me make sure I get to them all. But the tax rate, we expect to be 22% in the fourth quarter and going forward, starting from that 22% tax rate, as you build your models and you look out into the future for TI and you try to model our earnings, you should tax the incremental profit at 35% and let that fall through to the implied tax rate for 2013. As it relates to gross margin, gross margin in the quarter was 51.3% of the company level, but I'll remind you that we did have a $60 million insurance reimbursement that came through in the quarter. So that definitely benefited the gross margin a little bit in the quarter. As it relates to your question on OpEx, we did bring OpEx down in the quarter. I believe overall, we're down about $20 million quarter-over-quarter. And as we look out in the fourth quarter, I would expect we would continue to bring OpEx down especially in light of a weaker demand outlook that we've given our guidance.","Ron Slaymaker","So CJ, let me just clarify also. The lower effective tax rate, we made the adjustments in the third quarter that would cumulatively get the year to that tax rate. So therefore, fourth quarter, our expectation is that it would be at that 22% effective tax rate, barring any other additional discrete items. Do you have a follow-on, CJ?","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, one quick one. You talked about the consignment inventory program with SVA. How should we think about, I guess, the impact to revenues from that line item over the next quarter or 2 as that gets built into the model?","Ron Slaymaker","Well, I don't have a quarter-by-quarter guidance to give you. But what we said was it would be about $100 million in total, that will convert over to the program. And at any point in time, the revenue that is converting basically will shift out about 2 to 3 quarters. So as we step -- I'm sorry, 2 to 3 months, and it will move out about 2 to 3 months and we will complete the entire conversion process of that $100 million in 2 to 3 quarters time period. So again, as we, let's say if in the first quarter, just as an example, please don't take this as specific guidance. If we were to convert $40 million of SVA revenue over to this consignment support, basically that $40 million would not be in that first quarter in this upcoming quarter but would move out to the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, into the first quarter. And then to the extent that we took additional revenue and converted over to consignment, let's say $50 million or $60 million in the following quarter, then there would be another $10 million to $20 million, depending upon the actual amount of additional headwind in that quarter. So again, during the process in which we're converting, so that 2- to 3-quarter time period, there will be a headwind in potentially sequential growth and certainly in year-on-year growth comparisons for SVA. And again, the total amount at the TI level will be pretty minimal. But if you're just looking at the SVA product line, it will be a more meaningful impact to that business.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You don't want to get into the restructuring on wireless, but can you talk just in general about the operating expense for next year as you think about taking some of the R&D out focused on some of the big vertical markets and focusing on embedded. What's the overall impact on your operating expense structure?","Kevin P. March","Joe, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there are probably quite a few questions on our plans for the OMAP and Connectivity products as it relates to wireless handsets and tablets, and we don't have any additional comments to give you on that right now as we're working through those plans. But as soon as we do, we will share those with everybody. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, then I'll try a separate question. The dividend increase that you did in the quarter, can you talk about what drove the decision to do that and how you think about uses of cash between the buyback and dividend increases and other opportunities?","Kevin P. March","Sure. I think the decision to increase is really a function of the emerging model for TI as it continues to evolve, and that is even if you take a look at the most recent quarter, about 70% of our revenues were coming from our Analog and Embedded Processing technologies and business units. And those are areas that not only enjoy a relatively robust margins but, because of the R&D and manufacturing nature of those products, produce very robust levels of cash. And as we have been committed to for a long time, we continue to return that cash to our shareholders in the form of those dividends and stock buybacks, and that increase just represents the ongoing confidence of that business model continue to produce that kind of free cash flow in the future.","Operator","We will take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of the revenue guidance, even if I subtract the impact of, I guess it's about $260 million from all of the things coming and going, you still appear to be guiding substantially below the book-to-bill. Can you just tell us if there's anything else going on in there? And then also, how will that impact what would be normal seasonality in Q1 or how should we be thinking about Q1?","Ron Slaymaker","Chris, I don't know that -- I think book-to-bill is a -- is one consideration in guidance. Certainly, we look at orders, we look at order trends. One thing I would note that is when we look at order linearity through the course of the quarter, the month of September was the lowest month in the quarter. So that called the trend of orders as we move through the third quarter was a consideration. But, Chris, the other thing I would just is recall that only about 60% of TI's revenue operates on traditional backlog and order entry process. We've got about 40% of our revenue that is supported by consignment programs. And so with the consignment programs, we're getting the forecast information from those customers, but it doesn't show up as an order until the customer actually is ready to take the product or for us to ship the product. So again, orders are part of the story but they're not the whole story there. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, so you guys are guiding for a pretty tough environment in Q4. It's been tough all year. If this environment persists i.e. if this was the new normal, what -- where or what could you guys do in terms of capacity and OpEx to shore it up a little bit?","Kevin P. March","Chris, I think Jim asked earlier about any capacity considerations that we have and sort of addressed that one, I won't repeat that one. On the OpEx front, as I mentioned early on also, we will be expecting to take tighter controls on that certainly as we go to 4Q and reduced outlook. And we'll continue to manage Opex as we traditionally do to what our revenue outlook is. And so to the extent that the revenue continues to be a challenging environment, we'll continue to manage OpEx in a very tight fashion. I think it's about all I can really give you for color on that right now.","Ron Slaymaker","Chris, I mean, again, we talked about the capacity side. But if your mindset is that Q4 very well might be the new normal, I would just say you're much more pessimistic than TI is about our long-term outlook for our business. I think we view or going through a rough patch for the economy overall, but by no means do we translate that to the new normal for Texas Instruments.","Operator","And our next caller is Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one clarification. I'm curious why operating margins in your Other segment were so high, I think over 50% of sales. Was there anything special in that segment this quarter?","Kevin P. March","Yes, in the Other segment is where we book these nonrecurring items. So for example  the gain that we had on the Japan pitch plan of $140 million -- $144 million was booked into that segment, and also the recovery we had on the business interruption insurance was booked to that segment. So that's another $60 million you saw go in there. So clearly, the 2 of those combined is going to bump up that operating margin percent pretty handsomely.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then the main question is if I look at your core Analog business and if you look at the profitability of that business, just apples-to-apples, how does it compare with what a linear or an Analog devices or a Maxim are doing? Do you think your margins are comparable? If not, why not? I understand that there's a capacity utilization aspect, but what can you do to get close to the profitability of those other companies?","Kevin P. March","I think the publicly reported results of those companies actually show the benefit of the model that we've been trying to develop for TI overall, because it certainly produced very, very high and attractive margins, very low capital intensity and still generate lots of cash. Probably one of the larger differences between TI today and most of our Analog competitors is that we have quite a bit more available capacity than they do. And so clearly, our various segments, including our Analog segment, is experiencing portions of the end utilization charge that we've got as a result of that capacity. But we also believe that with our continuing share gains, and I might mention we do believe we have been gaining share again this year in Analog, that we would expect to fill up that capacity, and so that capacity continues to be quite valuable to our strategic plans as we look forward.","Ron Slaymaker","And, Vivek, I would also just add, when you take the products that TI has in our portfolio and if you compare them to any of those competitors that you might choose, I think our margins are probably very comparable, with the exception of underutilization differences here or there. But in general, the margins that we have for comparable products are very similar to that of our competitors is what I suspect because our pricing strategies are similar. It's not our objective to go out and underprice. It's not our objective to overprice. It's basically price the product competitively, and then try to win on features and performance and support that we can offer that customer. And I think from a cost standpoint, a manufacturing cost standpoint, put our costs probably up against any manufacturers in the world in terms of Analog. So I think that bigger difference, when you look at our business overall, is just that we are a much larger player than any of the companies that you named. And when you -- your strategy is to, as it is in some of those cases, is just to run just a very high gross margin business and be selective only for those pieces of business that support that gross margin, that's a fine strategy for that particular company, but it's going to result in a lower revenue level. Our strategy is to generate a very large Analog business that will generate a very attractive cash flow, and that means we're going to participate in a broader spectrum of business than what some of those more narrow competitors would be. So I would suggest probably that's the bigger difference, and in fact, when we go head-to-head with comparable products to those various competitors, margins are probably very similar.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I apologize if you mentioned this, but given that we kind of view the core revenue stream a little bit different from the wireless revenue stream, can you talk a little bit about, relative to the overall guide for December, kind of how you see wireless trending sequentially and if there's any significant changes with the components inside of wireless?","Kevin P. March","John, I think with wireless, we just recorded this, if you think of the 3 pieces inside, then you got OMAP, Connectivity and baseband. Baseband just reported about $54 million in the third quarter, and we expect that to be probably about the same in fourth quarter. As for the rest of wireless, going into those areas, probably going to be sub-$200 million is what we expect in the fourth quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","And that's OMAP Connectivity in third quarter were $270 million, so probably dipping more so than the company overall. And even though we don't generally give guidance further out, we told you for some time that baseband will continue to decline and essentially be gone in 2013. Our expectation is that flat fourth quarter and then probably cut in half sequentially as we roll in the first quarter. And at that point, we're down below 1% of TI's total revenue. So essentially down to 0. Do you have a follow-on, John?","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, Ron, just relative to your answer to Chris about the disconnect between book-to-bill in September quarter versus guide in December. I think you said September was the worst month of the September quarter. Just kind of curious, as we look in here to October, have you guys found the bottom yet in the business or how would you kind of characterize the start to this quarter versus the finish of the last quarter?","Ron Slaymaker","John, I don't -- I would say it is running very consistent with the outlook that we provided. We're not -- it's not a big bounce-back that's would cause us to question the numbers we've given nor has it deteriorated such to the point that whether we question those numbers again. So again, probably no real trend change in the month of October that would cause us to revisit one or the other. I guess one thing I could point out, and this is not so much for the month of October, but if you just look back at third quarter, another metric -- we look at our cancellations, and cancellations in the quarter actually were down sequentially. And I would say would be down below what we would consider normal levels. So when we take that data and put it together, we had a small upside in the quarter, it really just kind of points to that view that we have customers and distributors really running lean levels of inventory and continuing to provide us short visibility in orders that they placed in the form of backlog. So at the same time, we're in a position where our lead times are short, our inventory is sufficient. It allows us to operate well in that environment, but it's the nature of the market environment we're operating in.","Operator","And we'll take our next caller, Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","For the third one around wireless, I know you don't -- you're not prepared to give any guidance on what you're going to do. But in general, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how easy it actually is to separate out the embedded portion of OMAP and Connectivity from the more traditional wireless? How easy is it to separate those 2 disparate R&D organizations, and how does the R&D intensity between those 2 actually look?","Kevin P. March","Yes, the separation, certainly from a product standpoint, is fairly straightforward. But as you point out, from an R&D standpoint, the engineering teams, that's a bit more of an effort. There are some people devoted exclusively to the Embedded Processing applications of those technologies as opposed to the wireless or the tablet and cellphone applications. And there are some engineering teams that actually cross both areas because there's some commonality. But that's the one that's probably a little more challenging to -- for realignment purposes. As it relates to -- on a go-forward basis, the separation, the -- we find that business is under way. But again, we'll report on that when we have a little bit more behind us in the future.","Ron Slaymaker","Stacy, probably one thing I could add because I think you were just saying, you're asking not specific plans but how does the R&D intensity on the embedded side compare with the R&D intensity on -- for smartphones and tablets. And the answer is it's less on the embedded side. Our -- what we found thus far is that OMAP and Connectivity for embedded applications looks a lot like our other embedded product lines in many ways from an R&D perspective. So for example, a lot of the R&D that we spend on the embedded side is focused on creating derivative, basically looking at different -- just interfaces, et cetera, that you put around on packaging, various qualification options, a lot more in the form of application nodes, software as opposed to in smartphones and tablets where you're on a pretty rapid cadence of introducing a completely new architecture generation. So that part can slow down, and you focus more on spinning off derivative product investment. So from that standpoint, R&D on the embedded side of OMAP and Connectivity is a lower investment than what's needed on the smartphone and tablet side. Do you have a follow-on there, Stacy?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just very briefly, last quarter when it came time to talk about what Q4 seasonality looked like, you actually gave the details of a calculation correcting for Nat Semi, correcting for base and roll-off, and I think you even posted the details on the website. Could you give me -- give us an idea of what that same calculation actually would look like just on a historical basis for Q1?","Ron Slaymaker","For Q1? Sure. It is basically flat. It really is flat. So I think if you just do a 5-year average, you would see TI revenue down 4%. But that includes a pretty dramatic drop in the first quarter of 2009. So I exclude that as an outlier. Basically, I get TI revenue flat fourth quarter to first. And that holds true for our calculator business as well as business overall. So we don't have any kind of significant calculator seasonality in Q1 that would affect us the way it does in Q4. Okay, Stacy? And again, to your point, that's not -- if you go back and look at the record books, that's not necessarily a -- as a reported number. That is including SVA historical revenue and excluding baseband, and we make both of those adjustments really to try to mirror what our current portfolio looks like and what those historical trends might tell you about revenue trends on a go-forward basis.","Operator","And we'll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I look at the sequential decline that you've provided for the fourth quarter, and I recognized there are some puts and takes in there that we can adjust for. It's still amounts to the third worst sequential decline for TI in the last 10 years. I think it's the sixth worst sequential decline for the company in the last 20 years. I wonder if you can talk about, in light of those facts, talk about what you think may be different than how things were in the past periods when things got this bad? Is it different? Is it the same? How has the environment changed?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, Mr. Sunshine, I'll let Kevin answer your question.","Kevin P. March","Okay. Glen, I think that, just from a macro standpoint, certainly there's a lot of -- we just kind of surveyed the global environment. We're looking that -- in the U.S., you got a fiscal cliff that people are wondering what's going to wind up happening. You got a potential change in many people in the national government and lots of discussion about regulatory and tax changes, and that's certainly causing people to kind of sit on the sidelines and perhaps wait and see what new rules are going to be. In China, you got this similar sort of thing and they've got a once in 10-year change in their government happening this fall. And you got to imagine that those business people have a similar perspective that some of the rules may change with the new government, and so therefore they would also be inclined to slow down much the same way as we see here in the Americas. And finally, in Europe, again similar. Everybody knows there's a serious debt problem that must be addressed, and that's going to require some meaningful change, certainly in the tax environment and other regulatory elements there. You can imagine a similar sort of thing there. So I'd say that if I tried to compare this environment to some of those doom and gloom ones that you just alluded to in the last 10 years or more, these are certainly 3 examples of things that are probably quite different from any time during those past 10 years.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, Glen?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it kind of relates to the first one because actually in those doom and gloom periods, what's interesting is that they don't last all that long. And one that would argue actually that maybe there's a recovery that's coming in the next couple of quarters. I want -- I'd say that, and on the other hand, I hear from some of these industrial companies, not chip companies, that we could be in this kind of environment for the next 4, 5, 6 quarters. I wonder when you think about 2013 and how you're shaping the business, the cost structure for the business, are you sort of gearing for a flattish kind of environment just to be on the safe side? Or are you hoping that there's -- are you thinking that there's some kind of recovery that's bound to happen given how bad things are now?","Ron Slaymaker","And before Kevin answers the question on kind of what we might be thinking about in costs, et cetera, let me just remind that if we go back to late fourth quarter, late 2008, early 2009, how many of us, as we were going into that downturn, thought we were entering into a multi-year period of weakness. And it lasted 2 quarters, and we were back up to the races again. So I think we all need to be aware of how wrong we've been in the past and what that might say about where we are today. Kevin?","Kevin P. March","I think Ron just said it. What I'm about to say is going to be wrong. Let me just say that clearly, what we have done, Glen, is anticipate that we're going to grow TI whether or not the economy rose and prices along with it, will we grow because we're able to compete more successfully against our competitors with better product and better manufacturing remains to be seen. But that's why we invested in the manufacturing capacity that we have, and it's already bought and paid for. So even if we do wind up with a flat environment that's unattractive or a very strong growth environment that's very attractive, our manufacturing footprint is taken care of. Our CapEx bill is basically behind us, and so the result should be either -- whether result of growth is going to be very nice in the bottom line but certainly to the cash generation that, that will deliver for us. As it relates on the OpEx front, clearly in the near term, we're slowing down OpEx expenditures in light of the revenue environment that we're looking at. And we'll look into them and manage those pretty tightly. You may recall that we had talked in the past the model that we have for OpEx was that in periods of relatively weak revenue growth, our OpEx is probably going to be pushing up towards 30%. And in periods of stronger revenue growth, our OpEx will slide down closer to 20%. We're just -- we're probably in the mid to upper 20s right now, and we'll have to see where we'll go. But we will be operating with Opex inside those ranges, and we'll just see where the revenue outlook actually takes us and adjust accordingly.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Back to the SVA side and the conversion to consignment, can you give us a ballpark of the absolute revenues for SVA? And in your fourth quarter guidance, are you assuming that, that consignment transaction or transition actually hits the revenues starting in the fourth quarter there?","Ron Slaymaker","It will begin in fourth quarter. So it will have an impact on revenues in fourth quarter, and that's fully comprehended to the extent we have it in our guidance. Also, in terms of the SVA side, first half of this year, I don't have this updated through third quarter, but first half of this year, SVA was about 20% of our overall Analog revenue. So you can scale it from there. So a follow-on, Ross?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, switching gears to the often forgotten Other category, it seemed like you guys had a couple of things going very well in that, with insurance and calculators. So it seems to be up roughly $90 million, $100 million sequentially, but the whole segment only grew I think $18 million sequentially. So it seems like there was a big drop-off in something else. Can you just talk through what happened in the other parts of Other?","Kevin P. March","Yes, on a -- certainly, the business interruption was up. You're talking about the revenues, so that's the business interruption insurance that went through the revenue line, driving that up, and that was offset by DLP being down and ASIC being down on a sequential basis. Those are the 3 main moving parts inside there.","Operator","And we'll take our next caller, Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This one's for Kevin. Kevin, if I take out the insurance proceeds, the gross margin was still up sequentially, yet your production was down. So are we just looking at an improving mix here?","Kevin P. March","Yes.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is that all I get?","Kevin P. March","Yes.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, that was easy. You have a follow-on, Tore?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, and this one's for you, Ron. You mentioned that what you're expecting in Q4 is basically customer demand being down, yet you're giving a very wide range. So what are some of the moving parts here as far as your customers are concerned? Because again, you're saying there's no inventory adjustment, this is just true demand. So I'm just wondering why the wide range?","Ron Slaymaker","Yes, that's pretty straightforward, Tore, and it has to do with lead times that are running short. This isn't a case where lead times are on average 12 weeks. We would come into the quarter with the quarter pretty much fully booked. In this case, lead times are very short, and so there really is a, based upon our backlog, the backlog is not the full story. So things could turn out better than what we have at the middle of our guidance range or they could turn out worse, and that's why we give a range of revenue guidance. But especially in an environment like this where there's just a lot of moving pieces going on with the overall economic situation, as Kevin pointed out, and our backlog visibility is running short as our lead times.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If we look at -- if we back out the effect of the accounting changes, do you expect that your Silicon Valley Analog performance is going to be better, the same or worse than the rest of your Analog over the next few quarters in terms of year-over-year growth?","Ron Slaymaker","David, I think what we've said for in general, that our assumptions when we were basically running our own internal calculations on a potential financial returns of that acquisition, our assumptions that we build in were that in the first year, SVA would continue to lose market share as it had been pre- acquisition. In the second year, after the acquisition, we expected that we would have it running market neutral. So possibly less than TI's overall Analog business but at least running neutral with the market from a market share standpoint. And then in the third year is when we expect it to have it growing faster than the market and consistent with TI's own Analog business. So our expectation is that we will do that, if not better. Certainly, the first year, it lagged the market. We're coming into that period where again, if you look probably more from a resale perspective where it's unaffected by the consignment conversion, then we would expect that we have SVA growing consistent with the overall market. But also, as you point out, when you look at -- with that conversion, there will be some -- it will grow at a lower rate than what resale should show. Okay, David, and do you have a follow-on question?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, following your announcement of your strategic plan for OMAP and Connectivity, do you reckon any of your current OMAP or Connectivity business is associated with end-of-life buys?","Kevin P. March","David, we don't have any plans for end-of-life buys. We're going to support customers on whatever products they want to order, and that's the way we'll deal with that, which is typically how we'll deal with these things. When we, in the past, have changed the internal resource focus for other opportunities inside our portfolio, we've continued to honor whatever customers want on the old product, and we'll continue to do that on this as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I actually have one quick one, Ron. I don't think you tested the end markets. Where there any end market [indiscernible] we're showing signs with civilization?","Ron Slaymaker","Ambrish, you are not -- I could not hear you. If you could maybe pick up your receiver and repeat your question?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My question was I don't think you went into the end markets or geographies. You talked about wireless, but what's going on with the specific end markets? Are there any that are showing signs of worse deceleration or any geography that is getting worse or better?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, Ambrish. I can walk through it. What I would say is the weakness is pretty broad-based though with a very few exceptions. If we look at the industrial market, I think you've heard from other companies that have reported as well, the industrial market is weak. It affected TI revenue, especially in areas such as Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog. And I think from a regional standpoint, this shows up especially in the U.S. and European regions. Automotive, I would describe as mixed, where U.S. sales of automobile, so in-sales, continue to grow. But if you look at regions like China and Europe, they're declining. If you look at TI's revenue, our automotive revenue in Embedded Processing was even, and our Analog automotive revenue increased a small amount. Moving over to wireless infrastructure, I think as we talked about even at the mid-quarter update, that revenue was weak for TI, a combination of lower purchases by carriers and even adjustments of inventory as a result from OEMs in that space. I think as it affects TI, WCDMA continues to dominate the air standard demand overall, and TI played there strongly. Although you're seeing probably growth, and you've seen this probably in some other companies' reports, on the LTE side, although I would say that spending is a bit volatile or erratic quarter-to-quarter. And again, we play on both WCDMA as well as LTE. From a regional standpoint there, I would say China continues to be weak, as well as slowdowns in the U.S. are contributing to the weakness as well. If you look over in computing, no surprise there. There is a lot of weakness both on the commercial side as well as public spending. Don't know the impact of Windows 8, don't know the impact that tablets are having on cannibalization. All I know is our revenue, as we sold into that space, generally was weak, including in the peripheral space, so meaning hard disk drives and printers. Probably one area of exception would be in our Analog battery management products, that revenue actually was up in PCs and in notebook chargers. But in both cases, that really is due to share gains from TI as opposed to strength in the market. But last story I would mention would be consumer. There, we're seeing seasonal growth really being driven by gaming and audio type of products, backlog visibility there in -- especially into the back-half of Q4 is pretty short, and we expect fourth quarter to see a seasonal decline, again, driven by the same areas. Okay, your question on the geographic split. U.S. was down, Europe was down, Japan was down. The one area that grew was Asia, and of course, Asia is large enough to offset all those other areas because about 2\/3 of our revenue ships into Asia. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I actually do, Ron. Just trying to tie back inventory and what we're hearing from the industrial guys. So for instance, Caterpillar is now talking about their dealers reducing inventory, how does that -- and I've been also of the view that inventory has been lean in the channel, and maybe I'm wrong as well because now that starts getting flushed back into the system. Does that then translate into inventory getting elevated again, specifically in areas like industrial? And any perspective would be helpful, Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","I'm sorry, you're -- Ambrish, you said some of these players are saying their inventory -- their end product inventory needs to be reduced?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Not any reference, specifically referring to Caterpillar, which said that their dealers are reducing inventory, something to that effect. So my question is inventory has been low but now the demand decelerating the way it is, it is the 6, 6.5 weeks at a risk of getting elevated over the next quarter or so?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, I understand. Let me first of all say, when we're talking about inventory, of course, we're referring to inventory of TI components. Generally, even at our OEMs much less for customers that purchased through distributors, we don't have a lot of downstream visibility into their end products and  into their inventory. To the extent -- I think distributors are trying just like TI as to really stay on top of the demand trends and make inventory adjustments on a real-time basis, so that they do not get into an excess situation. I think over the last few quarters, you've heard us talking about distributor inventory holding at about or just below 6.5 weeks I think for 3 quarters now. So -- and clearly, revenues have been shifting around, and we've had a few surprises in that environment. So I guess what I would say is I think distributors, OEM customers, TI, ourselves, we're all trying to just really keep aligned with end demand to avoid inventory going one way or the other. There's just a lot of sensitivity there. So hopefully, we do that going forward.","Operator","And we'll take that final caller, Doug Freedman with RBC.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","When I look at your comments about just the conversation you just started as far as inventories and what's going on, you do have a high consignment turns that you guys execute to. How well is your product output lining up with the customer demand as such? How long can we continue to provide these low lead times before you end up with a mismatch to a forecast that drives some extension there?","Ron Slaymaker","Well, I think our goal would be to do it for an extended period of time now. That doesn't always work through, but one of the things you see is that we're running, what, 101 days of inventory? If you compare that back to early '09. I believe we were in the mid-70s or so in terms of days of inventory. So we are carrying a different level of inventory, and part of that is because our portfolio changed. We are much more about standard or catalog product these days where off-the-shelf availability is important. And by the way, the risks of that inventory is also lower because we have lots of different customers that we can sell into with these same products. And typically, these are very long-lived products. So again, just the risk of carrying that inventory is lower. So I would say that's probably our biggest consideration and protection against what you just described, as well as keeping our factories prime to go and flexible up or down. Do you have a follow-on, Doug?","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I guess my follow-on is really looking at those factories, and I might try to steal Ross' follow-up as well. When you look at your factories in Q4, how many shutdown days do we have, and is there an expectation that you're going to have to keep some shutdown in Q1? And then my Ross' follow-up really is just looking at your forward guidance. You basically have offered us enough numbers on the other and the mobile group. I'm coming up with about 8% to 9% decline sequentially for Embedded Processing and Analog, if you were to guide by group. Does that -- is that computing properly?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, I don't have -- other than the information we provided for you on wireless, I don't have a -- or I'm going to -- not going to break the guidance down segment-by-segment. So that's -- those kinds of assumptions are what you guys get paid to do. In terms of shutdown, obviously, when our utilization goes down and runs low, there are a lot of different methods that we use to maintain the efficiency of our factories. And so shutdowns and idling and scheduling vacation or holiday times and breaks are part of what we do. But I don't have anything to set here and discuss publicly in terms of how we will deal with it other than those are usually part of the mix.","Before we end this call, let me remind you that we have an upcoming investor meeting on November 1 at our Silicon Valley Analog facility in Santa Clara, California. At this meeting, our Analog manager, Brian Crutcher, and his management team will update investors on our strategy for growth in Analog and our execution progress. So if you have not already registered for this meeting, please do so or contact us if you need additional information.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","David Pahl","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the roles of President and CEO along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years, and under his continuing leadership we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages, and running our operations with laser focus.","Turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses.","Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.","Free cash flow for the trailing twelve-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.","We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing twelve-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remains unchanged.","I\u2019ll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain [ph]. High volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from the year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC.","Now I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across fourteen sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive and continue to deliver broad based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low-single digits with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers. Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low-to -mid single-digit sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.","In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael?","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.62 billion or 65.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing twelve-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue within our range of expectations.","Over the last twelve months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top-line and gain market share. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then declined to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.","Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47% up from 44.7% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4% up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue.","Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis, up 42% from a year ago. In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends, and repurchased $1.02 billion of our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability.","Our balance sheet remained strong with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due andraised $1.5 billion of 30 year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to non-cash charges. More details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data.","In closing, I will know that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top-line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our comparative advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products.","We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, we can now open up the lines for questions in order to provide as many of you possible the opportunity to ask your question please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we\u2019ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Thank you, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. So, David, my first question is just on the high volume analog segment. I think in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that\u2019s declined year-over-year in the June quarter. I\u2019m kind of curious to what extent was that by choice as you pruned the portfolio, to what extent do you think that that's just a handset phenomenon as it builds last year for product cycles more robust than this year? And to what extent do you feel that might be a leading indicator for maybe some excess in the \u201ccycle\u201d?","David Pahl","Yeah, John, thanks for asking that question. I think what we're seeing there is a result of how we've been allocating our resources in R&D. And if you remember back in February in our Capital Management Calls, we went through that. We've got a pretty disciplined process. And essentially, what we're trying to do is steer more money to long-lived revenue opportunities where we've got some level of differentiation and we'll have that for some time.","So, you know, I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That\u2019s inclusive of what happened inside of high volume. And again, I think that that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities. If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously industrial and automotive continue to do well. Inside of HVAL, you would see that industrial and automotive did well as well. It just doesn't make up as much of a percentage of that revenue. So anyway we're pleased with that outcome and not surprised by it. Do you have a follow-on, John?","John Pitzer","Yeah, and then Rafael as my follow-on, I know it's probably better to look at the business trends on a year-over-year basis rather than sequential and on a year-over-year you showed really good operating margin leverage in the embedded business. But sequentially it was flat on op revenue and there's still that gap between embedded op margins and analog op margins. How do you think about the leverage in the embedded market from here? And will we ever close that gap between embedded and analog?","Rafael Lizardi","So, let me step back and take you back to our capital management strategy and some of the things that we say there and how we think about driving value for owners of the company. And to us, it all comes down to growing free cash flow per share. So it's not operating margins, it\u2019s not gross margin, it's not analog versus embedded, it's all about growing free cash flow per share. Both of those businesses are and we expect to continue to be contributors to that free cash flow per share. So the focus is growing the top-line. As we continue to invest in what we think are the best markets, the industrial and automotive, and in the case of analog as we continue to expand our 300-millimeter footprint where we have a structural cost advantage.","David Pahl","Okay, now we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","And we have Timothy Arcuri from UBS.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you very much. I had a question on the guidance. The June numbers were a little bit below seasonal and I know that seasonal is hard to really figure out what's actually normal. But that was kind of coming off more difficult Q1 comps. But if I look at the September quarter guidance, it's a few hundred basis points below seasonal and it's up like 300 basis points year-over-year, which is you know the lowest in a couple of years. Is there any element of more difficult comps or is there in fact some kind of channel inventory headwinds? Thank you.","David Pahl","Yeah, Tim, I just say that when we put together our guidance, the two strongest signals that we see are orders that we get from customers as well as the demand fees that we get through our consignment programs. And I would just say that if there is something specific to call out as we have in the past, if there was a specific customer or specific end market or something like that that was changing, we would let you know about that.","And as example lead times remain stable, cancellations remain low, reschedules remain low. We look at inventory and the channels and that remained steady at about four weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint. And the other thing as you pointed out when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal. And so if you look over the last five years, we've had a 9% sequential growth. Three of those five years has been at 6%. And if you look over a ten year period, it's 7%. So certainly our guidance from a seasonal standpoint is certainly within the range of things that we've seen in the past. Do you have a follow on?","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks and then I guess just as a quick follow on. Dave, can you give what orders and book to bill were?","David Pahl","I can give that. Let me just find it. Yeah, so orders, book to bill \u2013 orders were up 10% sequentially, book to bill was 1.06. I'll point out it was 1.06 a year ago and 1.03 last quarter. I always feel the need to comment on book to bill with about 60% of our revenue going through consignment programs where we don't get any orders in advance of pull from that demand. So the book to bill isn't as strong of a signal or is at least as clear of a signal as what it used to be in the past. So thank you, Tim. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","And we'll take our next caller from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hey, guys.","David Pahl","Hi, Ross.","Ross Seymore","Let me ask you a question. Dave, just want to ask about from \u2013 not necessarily a cyclical point of view, but from a macro point of view. With all the discussion of trade wars, tariffs, et cetera, I know you haven't called out seeing anything further, your answer to the last question, but just how does TI in general think about that dynamic as potentially impacting your business? And are you, in fact, seeing any impact as of yet?","Rafael Lizardi","Yeah, Ross, I will go ahead and take that. First, let me take TI's long-term support of free trade and strong IP protection. And those are both important to TI and the broader ST industry. So we continue \u2013 we feel that way. We have stated, we had been in that position for a long time and we continue to do that and advocate that. Specifically on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July, so those are not in place yet.","If \u2013 once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed of Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue is exports, so not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin as a \u2013 would be deemed as Chinese origin.","So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential \u2013 any adjustments, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. So at the end of the day, we don't see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact. Now, that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade \u2013 anything against free trade between the two largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody.","David Pahl","Do you have follow on, Ross?","Ross Seymore","Yeah, I do. Just switching back to your product segments, it seemed like Analog sequentially was pretty much in line what we've seen for the last few years, but Embedded was lower and Other was much higher than what we've seen. And I know you guys think of things year-over-year, but if we look at it sequentially, is there any reasons behind the Embedded being lower and the Other being so much higher?","David Pahl","Yeah, I think if you look at Embedded, it has a higher percentage of comms equipment. So it was impacted by that. And then in Other, don't forget that we've got strong seasonality in second and third quarter. So, thank you, Ross, for those questions. And we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We have our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. I guess, two questions for me as well. Maybe first off, could you quantify the revenue impact you had from \u2013 not your word, mine \u2013 but product rationalization or product optimization that you guys went through in the June quarter? And does that revenue headwind, if you may, flow into the September quarter as well to some degree?","David Pahl","Amit, can you clarify what you mean by product rationalization?","Amit Daryanani","Yes. I think, Dave, when you talked about the consumer-centric markets, you talked about how some of the revenue declines there were driven by the fact that you just decided not to participate in some of these markets, a reflection of how your R&D budgets are tracked over time. Is that fair? And if so, I guess, how much was that revenue impact driven by?","David Pahl","Well, I think, if you look and we shared this back in February on our Capital Management Call. As we looked at allocating resources across end markets and specifically in personal electronics, when you compare our spend there versus five and ten years ago, it's lower. Now, it's not zero. There's still good opportunities that we find inside of personal electronics and continue to invest. We're just looking for sustainable growth opportunities inside of that space. So that's really what we're talking about.","So again, I think the first question came in specifically about one of the businesses inside of our Analog segment. I think you have to judge the efficiency of our capital allocation by the total results. And that, we're quite pleased with. So does that help to answer your question?","Amit Daryanani","No, that's helpful. And I guess, if I could just follow-up, you guys have had multiple quarters of gross margin expansion, very consistent on a year-over-year basis. As you think about the back half of 2018, can you maybe talk about what are the levers that could enable gross margins to continue to expand from here? And do you feel comfortable that gross margin should expand in the back half?","Rafael Lizardi","Yeah, I\u2019ll go ahead and take that Amit. As we have talked about in Capital Management and in other settings, our focus for value creation for the owners of the company is free cash flow per share. It's not gross margin. It's not operating margin. It's dollars of free cash flow per share. So the opportunity for expanding that and continuing to grow that are simple. It's the top line as we continue to invest in the best products and the best markets and the best markets because that's where the semiconductor content is expanding and we continue to gain share there.","And then, 300-millimeter. We have talked about that for a number of years. As of last year, about $4 billion of our revenue went through 300-millimeter, four out of ten in the Analog space. So that leaves a lot of room for continued expansion on 300-millimeter and continuing to grow that free cash flow per share.","David Pahl","Okay, thank you, Amit. And we will go the next caller please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Yes, good afternoon. Solid job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow generation. Your focused markets, automotive, you've got 5 subsegments. Industrial, you've got 14 subsegments. Can you guys just give us a sense on the breadth of the year-over-year growth in these markets? Were a majority of these subsegments up year-over-year? Any color here would be helpful.","David Pahl","Yeah, Harlan, when you look at that growth, we're really pleased with it. It\u2019s very broad based. And when you look at all of the sectors, out of the 19 combined that we had, 18 of them actually grew. So it\u2019s very broad-based. I think when you look across different products, different investments and we look at our design-ins in our pipeline, that \u2013 those continue to be very broad-based. So that gives us confidence in the sustainability of that growth. And of course, it doesn't mean that we won't see cyclical headwinds at some point. But when you look at it from a five and ten year standpoint, we feel really good about the progress that we have made. Do you have follow-on, Harlan?","Harlan Sur","Yeah, thanks for the insights there. And so kind of to follow-up on that maybe from a geographical perspective, right? I think last quarter, all regions \u2013 and I know this is ship to, right? This is ship to data, but still, nevertheless important, but last quarter I think all regions were up except for Japan. What did you see this quarter?","David Pahl","That is the same story. And my friends in Japan, I've talked to them a couple of times. They're \u2013 give them a shout-out to them that the revenue is down, but when you look at \u2013 we've got some reporting tools that allow us to look through what we call channel independent reporting. And as you mentioned, it's a ship to. So they're continuing to make progress with the customers there. Just a lot of that revenue ends up shipping either somewhere in Asia or it ships in Europe or in the U.S. even though it's designed in there. So \u2013 but the actual measurement that we have is the shipping label on the box. So unfortunately, they're still called out on the conference call, which I know they're not happy about. So thank you, Harlan. And we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from bank of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. For the first one, your CapEx is now \u2013 I think it was over 6% in Q2, I think, trailing four quarters, it's 5.5%. Depreciation is now below CapEx. So where are all these incremental investments going? And what is the right long-term model we should assume for CapEx and depreciation?","Rafael Lizardi","Yeah, let me take that. First let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long-term. So the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share.","So we have been \u2013 and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up and that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to \u2013 is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories where we invest some of that CapEx, but predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factories.","Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what would that drew \u2013 what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which, again, drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which, to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow.","And then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had a \u2013 we have tax reform and, as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of one-time tax related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison.","David Pahl","Okay, so with that Vivek do you have a follow-up?","Vivek Arya","Yeah, thanks, Dave. Beyond just the trade issue, I know there has been talk of shortages of passive components. I know you guys don't supply that, but your other peers do. But have you seen your customers behave in a different way, stock up, stock down on various things that might impact your trajectory just because your customers might be short of other components to help complete their systems?","David Pahl","Yeah, Vivek, I think one-thing that we have spend a lot of time trying to do and remain focused on is keeping lead time stable. And for the vast majority of our products, they continue to remain stable. And that doesn't mean that we don't have hotspots and, of course, we'll work with customers to close those gaps as aggressively as we can. And the other important metric that we look in inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got a stated lead time and if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous.","And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there? It certainly could be, but it's not something that we would have visibility into. So I think if we just remain focused on what we can control, which is the lead times and shipping performance, customers can have confidence in getting product from us. Okay, we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is ask about the near-term OpEx trajectory. Normally in Q3, you'd probably be down a little bit sequentially. Is there any drivers or anything that could be going on that would make things into this Q3 different than what we might ordinarily have seen given, I guess, some of the historical trends that we've seen leading into this?","Rafael Lizardi","So, Stacy, as you know, we give revenue guidance and EPS guidance and stop it at that unless there were any unusual trends and if so \u2013 right between the lines, and if so, we would point that out. We're not pointing that out because there's nothing unusual. So you should expect just our usual trends within reasonable ranges.","David Pahl","Do you have follow-on, Stacy?","Stacy Rasgon","I do, thank you. There\u2019s earlier question on CapEx. And we know it's elevated now because you guys are out looking for other assets. At the same time, obviously, as you continue to grow, you're filling out 300-millimeter and that's a margin benefit. Do you think, over time, the benefit from increasing penetration of 300-millimeter more than offsets the depreciation expense on your gross margins?","Rafael Lizardi","Well, so the way I like to look at this is from a cash standpoint. So I think of that investment as cash flowing out, the first cell on your spreadsheet, and then after that is return. I don't think about it for those purposes from a depreciation standpoint. So as we continue to invest on 300, we think that is \u2013 those are very good, long-term investments that will last for a long time. Any time we put any of these tools in place and the cash fall-through on those investments is pretty high.","David Pahl","Okay, thank you very much, Stacy. And I think we have time for one more caller.","Operator","And we have one more question from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. You said that some of your personal electronics markets were up and some were down. Can you give me a bit more color on which? And I know smartphones, in particular, I think grew in Q1 as smartphones continue to grow into Q2? Thanks.","David Pahl","Yeah, Joe, I won\u2019t go into that level of detail. We did want to give some color on what was going on inside of personal electronics that we see \u2013 we saw multiple sectors growing inside of there. We had some customers that were growing, but also wanted to point out not all customers were growing. So that's what we saw. I think what that illustrates is the power of having a diverse product portfolio and being able to sell to multiple customers.","And kind of to my point earlier, we look at the opportunity inside of personal electronics. Longer term, we don't see that as a significant growth engine for us, but it is a place that we continue to invest and we really believe the majority of the growth is really going to come from industrial and automotive. So incrementally, as we've taken up our spend, we've moved it more into those growth areas. So \u2013 but again, we're going to have handsets and PCs and those other things for decades to come. So we just find good opportunities inside of there and want to continue to invest in them. Do you have follow-on, Joe?","Joe Moore","Yeah, thanks for the color there. In terms of longer-term question on communication infrastructure, obviously, it's been soft for everyone in the last few quarters. How do you think about the 5G opportunity? I think the comment that you've made just now and repeatedly that the investment areas are industrial and automotive. Do you think there's an opportunity around 5G that you need to invest in? And just to help us understand how that will affect TI.","David Pahl","Sure, yeah, so I think again I would refer back to our capital management presentation as we walked through that thinking remains consistent with that. So from a comms equipment standpoint, I would say that our investments have shifted over time. If you look at the 5G standards and the things needed to support the new things, new frequencies being added, things like the massive MIMO, antennas that are going in for beamforming and other things like that, that is all complexity that you find in the radio itself.","And for us, that translates into Analog products to be able to support that. So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that. So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that, in general, very confident in our position. And we've got \u2013 we're building off of a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments.","Rafael Lizardi","So, that was the last call?","David Pahl","Correct.","A - Rafael Lizardi","Yeah, so before we close, I just want to make a point because it wasn't asked, but our results, among other things, demonstrate our continued discipline and execution on capital management strategy. We generated on a trailing 12-month basis $5.7 billion of free cash flow and we would return $5.6 billion of free cash flow in that timeframe. So virtually, all free cash flow generated was returned to the owners of the company. That was both through dividends and buybacks. In the case of dividends, on that comparison, it was 41% of free cash flow. So right between 40% and 60% guidance, but clearly towards the lower end, so I'd just underscore the sustainability of those dividends.","David Pahl","Okay, thank you, Rafael and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","David Pahl","Thank you and good afternoon. And thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","I\u2019ll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago.","In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.","In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago.","Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.","We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment.","From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by Processors.","In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by a decrease in royalties and custom ASIC products.","Now I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s revenue performance by end markets versus a year-ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth, with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.","We continue to focus on making our Company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth.","Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Kevin March","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million, or 21.9% of revenue.","Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion, or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% percent from the year-ago quarter.","Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $968 million, or $0.94 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter.","On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million, or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300 millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion, or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we\u2019ve said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.","Our intent, over time, remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. Consistent with this intent, we\u2019ve announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 annualized.","I also will note we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% of trailing four-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. Today\u2019s announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are an important element of shareholder returns.","In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on-shore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago.","Turning to our outlook, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about OpEx is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter R&D up and you talked about increasing R& D investment. Given that what are your expectations for R&D in total OpEx as we go into Q4 I know seasonally they would be down, but given the increases that we\u2019re seeing in R&D how should we think it OpEx next quarter.","Kevin March","So Stacy I think as we\u2019ve talked about R&D what we continue to reallocate and we will continue to reallocate through the first half of next year resources from other areas of the company into R&D. But overall, you should think about OpEx in 4Q pretty much being the same as you\u2019ve seen in each of the last several years that is down, because we have seasonal benefit there just from the fact that there\u2019s going to be Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays going on. So total OpEx, the shift continued to be seasonally down.","David Pahl","Do you have a follow-up?","Stacy Rasgon","Yes, thank you. From a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the change in strategy between or apparent change in strategy between dividends and buybacks. Does that imply and I mean what does that imply in terms of how you see the current return on your own stock versus the potential for at least how you view the stability and strength of your business going forward, seems like you\u2019re allocating more into dividends now?","Kevin March","Well. And that is correct. We are planning to allocate more towards the dividends at this point in time. We\u2019ve always said the buybacks will vary as a function of the stock price and a dividend model that can vary from 50% to 80%, we believe there is more thorough comprehensive or capital allocation. This new model provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about here.","David Pahl","Okay, great. Thank you, Stacy. Next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the analog margin side. I believe record levels for you 40 plus here. I think the highest I\u2019ve seen out there is high 40s at linear. Curious do you think that you could achieve that over time and as part of that thought process what percentage of your mix would have to be on 300 millimeter to get to that kind of level.","Kevin March","C.J. the possibility for improving margins in analog are not anything that we would hold back your expectation on, because you\u2019ve actually hit the essence of the formula there and that is we have more and more revenue being generated on 300 millimeter where we enjoy a significant cost benefit versus any of our competitors. We\u2019ll see that just falling straight through not just the margin, but all the way through the free cash flow which is most important in our mind. So clearly, as you pointed out, this has been a new height for our analog segment and that business still has plenty of runway underneath as we go forward.","David Pahl","And than I just add C.J. that when you look at our practice of buying capacity well ahead of demand, that puts us in a places. At the end of last year, we had about $6 billion of open 300 millimeter capacity. So as revenue grows that was 200 millimeter capacity that will help to grow free cash flow margin as well as operating margins in the businesses that you\u2019ve been. So the fact that it\u2019s 300 millimeter, of course and the fact that it\u2019s 40% lower cost will certainly help us as well. Do you have follow-up C.J.?","C.J. Muse","I do. A shorter term question, as you look to your implied guide of down 10% and I know typical seasonality is kind of throwing out the door here, but I guess in the last five years your average is roughly down 7%. So is there any one-time issues here, customer concentration, conservatism how should we think about that?","David Pahl","Yes. I think if you look at the midpoint of the guidance C.J., it would suggest a year-on-year growth of about 3%. So I think in general, we just believe that\u2019s just very consistent with the modest overall macro environment. And that\u2019s really kind of been the case for the last few years. So our view really remains that we\u2019re in the slow growth economic environment. We don\u2019t really see any catalyst that\u2019s really going to change that one direction or the other any time soon. So thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next caller is Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi, thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the demand environment. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on the different buckets within TI industrial personal electronics, comms equipment in automotive and specifically what sort of trends you saw in the quarter and more importantly what your internal expectations are heading into Q4.","David Pahl","Okay. So let me just talk about what drove the quarter. As I mentioned before, the automotive market remained strong. We\u2019ve got five sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double-digit. Industrial demand improved and encouraging part of that was it was very, very broad-based and we had most of the sectors growing.","Inside the personal electronics that was even and that was despite continued year-over-year declines in demand from one customer, but I think that speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics.","And then communications equipment grew from a year ago was even sequentially. And lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll call out anything that is moving around significantly, you\u2019ve seen us do that in the past when we\u2019ve had some type of discontinuity to help explain the results and that\u2019s not the case as we move into fourth quarter. So do you have a follow-up Tosh?","Toshiya Hari","Yes, I do. Thanks for that. So my second question is on M&A, clearly TI has been very disciplined especially with regards to valuation over the past couple of years maybe even several years. Obviously, you\u2019ve seen a lot of activity elsewhere in the industry, I was just hoping you could provide an update on as to how you approach M&A detail? Thank you.","Kevin March","Tosh our first M&A is really no different than we\u2019ve talked about in the past. There are really four attributes that we think that we have put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity and all that positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace.","So when we look at the acquisitions, it\u2019s both trying to see if we can strengthen those four attributes and really if not so by looking at companies and standpoint of the strategic match. That means, we\u2019ll have strategic match delivered to the strength of the competitive advantage we\u2019ve been building on these last number of years.","So from a strategic standpoint that would probably include a company that\u2019s likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to Industrial and Automotive which is where we believe most of the growth for some if that is going to happen for a quite a few years to come.","If a potential target passes the strategy test and we\u2019ve got to get past the numbers test. And that really means the price that we pay for it. For the return on that price for the return on that investment capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about a four-year timeframe. If we can get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines.","As we look at what\u2019s been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years and strike us that there are probably really two things underway for most participants in that space they\u2019re either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets.","In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those, so we don\u2019t feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy and match test I just talked about a moment ago.","David Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Toshiya. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We have Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Danely","Thanks guys. I guess one more question on the Q4 revenue guidance. I am just looking at the results of the last 10 or so years and it\u2019s only been down double-digits I think once in eight years or something like that. I remember last year you guys got it down 7% sequentially. Has anything changed recently? Have you seen any change in order rates, any change in the end markets, change in linearity, change in anything I\u2019m just wondering why the downtime?","David Pahl","Yes, again Chris, no big changes on that. I think it\u2019s just consistency with the overall macro and if you look over the last five years, we\u2019ve had a range from as high as down 1.3% and back in 2012 I think we\u2019re down 12.1%. So certainly our range that we\u2019ve given is certainly inside of those things from a sequential standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at them. Do you have a follow-on?","Christopher Danely","Yes. Can you just talk about utilization rates? How much sort of below capacity you guys are? And where we should expect utilization rates to trend in Q4 and how you feel about inventory as a result of that?","Kevin March","So Chris on utilization, it really hasn\u2019t changed much from probably last three or four quarters and I don\u2019t expect it to change anytime in the near-term. We load the factories on accordance with our expectation of demand and because of our inventory strategy sometimes that demands goes beyond just next quarter may include the following quarter.","From an inventory standpoint to recall that our model is to have 105 to 135 days. We had quite a bit more inventory last quarter and we from a day standpoint and we had \u2013 David mentioned that we have built that anticipation of growing revenues in the third quarter. We have had those growing revenues and our inventory days dropdown to 117. So I expect that will continue to operate within the model days that we talk about and our utilizations will continue to be relatively stable as we\u2019ve seen in the last three four quarters.","David Pahl","Great, thank you Chris. Next caller please.","Operator","Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","Great, thank you. I have one short-term question and one long-term question. In the shorter-term you said Personal Electronics kind of flat year-over-year despite declines that one customer can give us a sense for which areas are growing year-over-year as other smartphones, PCs, where that growth components of that business right now?","David Pahl","Yes, at that level we\u2019ve had PCs come in year-over-year about even which is an improvement from what we saw. I think that outside of that one customer we\u2019ve actually seen really broad based growth. And so I think that all the classical areas inside a Personal Electronics are doing well. So you have a follow-on?","Joseph Moore","Sure, thank you. And then longer-term side as you look at your automotive business. Obviously that\u2019s a focus for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about how do you plan for that business and how much of your effort is sort of aimed at sort of traditional building block catalog type products, and when you think about markets like autonomous driving where there might be sort of systems level solutions how much are you thinking about the sort of need to do something, that\u2019s a little bit more revolutionary rather than evolutionary in that part market?","David Pahl","Sure yes, so we have - we\u2019ve got five sectors that make up the automotive market for us that we look at their infotainment, safety, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, Body Electronics and Lighting and then power train systems, which include hybrid and electric systems.","And we have a very intentional focus to invest across all of those five sectors. We\u2019re seeing that in the results with revenues and most of those sectors growing double digits and we have an approach inside of Automotive that is similar really across their other markets where we look to leverage our four competitive advantages and I think that that\u2019s helping to turn in those results.","So we are favoring what I would say a catalog and application specific solutions. I wouldn\u2019t put that into the category of full turnkey system level solutions where we\u2019re doing what we would consider to be the work that our customers do. So we are providing them. Building blocks that have different levels of integration but we\u2019re not looking to provide a full ADAS system as an example. So will enable those systems and I think that that\u2019s pretty consistent with what you see across all the markets and sectors that that we serve, so. Okay. Thanks Joe and we\u2019ll go to next caller please.","Operator","And we have Chris Caso with CLSA.","Christopher Caso","Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess first question would be regarding your comments on the industrial segment you talked about some broad improvement. I guess could you talk about your level of visibility there and the likelihood of that sustaining into the end of the year and moving into next year?","David Pahl","Can you just ask that once again make sure I got the question right, Chris.","Christopher Caso","Sorry, it was regarding the Industrial segment and your comments on that you talked about broad improvement. If you can give some more color on that and your view on the potential for that to sustain into year end and into next year?","David Pahl","Yes. I think as we talked about last quarter we did see an improvement in industrial demand it actually had been flat for several quarters year-on-year, so we were encouraged by that. This quarter we\u2019ve built on that a little bit and like last quarter it was very, very broad-based. I won\u2019t try to go in and try to predict how long that will last or carryforward, but I definitely would say that we were encouraged as we saw most of those sectors growing. Yes, follow-on Chris.","Christopher Caso","I do kind follow-on is regarding inventory in both the channel at your customers and given the stronger growth in Q3 was any part of that growth perhaps contributed to some increase in inventory, understand that most of your inventory in the distribution channel on consignment now, but what\u2019s your view of customer inventory levels right now?","David Pahl","Yes. So if we look into the distribution channel inventory is actually decreased by about a half a week and it\u2019s currently very, very low levels at about four weeks and that\u2019s pretty similar to what we saw a year-ago. So again, we just we believe that that inventory level just reflects an environment of really good product availability and we\u2019ve got you know good inventories on our books available to be able to ship.","We continue to have very stable lead times and those things kind of taken together just drive very high customer service metrics. So customers in general are getting products when they want to have them. So and I\u2019ll just make the reminder too that four weeks of inventory is just structurally lower because of the consignment programs that we have at our major distributors. So thank you Chris and we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We have Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. My first question is on the embedded side. This segment has been growing really well for the last third quarter in the year posting pretty good year-over-year growth. What\u2019s driving that Dave, I know it has three major segments? Could you just help us understand the drivers behind the growth?","David Pahl","Yes I think when you look at the embedded market. We\u2019ve seen good growth there for a number of quarters and if you look at the end markets they have a very good exposure to automotives, to industrial, and to that the comps markets. So as we talked about the communications market or really all three of those markets contributed to the growth.","And the great thing about the growth is it\u2019s very broad-based its not in. One market it\u2019s not in, one sector it\u2019s not driven by one technology. So we feel really good about the sustainability of that growth and the great thing with that is it\u2019s fallen through to the operating profit, which you can see inside of that business. And most importantly is following through to free cash flow growth. So you have a follow on Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes, I did. Could you talk a little bit your \u2013 that this seems to be a change in the relationship with how you work with your major distribution partners and our sense is this is nothing new, but could you just help us understand how you thought through the pros and cons of this change and whether it\u2019s just a matter of you having more in consignment or it\u2019s trade-off between confidence of sourcing your own wins versus potential loss in future sales? Thank you.","David Pahl","Yes. So our relationship with distributors have been evolving and always evolving like any healthy business relationships of all, but especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So you know you\u2019ve heard Kevin and I both mention our four competitive advantages and certainly the reach of our channel is one of them.","And so that includes both the size and the skill of our direct sales and applications teams, but it also includes the growing capabilities of the web and TI.com. So as an example three years ago we discontinued our incentive programs for demand creation on accounts that represented about 80% of the TAM where we had resources calling on those accounts directly.","We made that that change because our team is just more effective and efficient at and demand creation and this is played out as we\u2019ve continued to gain share every year since then. And more recently, we\u2019ve discontinue the incentives for remain balance of the accounts. So we expect as with all relationships that will continue to evolve but we do believe distributors will continue to play an important role in order fulfillment for our customers. Okay, thank you Ambrish. And we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We have David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Thanks very much. TI and several other chip companies had really impressive September year-over-year growth. That was many percent about guidance and you\u2019re also giving December guidance which is solid even then the year-over-year growth in December looks like it\u2019s going to be below September. Can you give us some feel as to what\u2019s happening here that things weaken and September progressed or is December particularly tough comparison?","David Pahl","Yes. David if you look at our normal seasonality the one thing that we can conclude for sure is that the second and third quarter are seasonally strongest quarters fourth and first are seasonally weakest and so certainly that that will play in effect as we go into fourth quarter. So it\u2019s not unusual for us to see fourth quarter that\u2019s down and in fact why we point to the year-over-year guidance and how that is consistent with just our belief is that things in the macro really haven\u2019t changed too dramatically. So that has gone into the guidance. Do you have a follow-on.","David Wong","No. I am good. Thank you.","David Pahl","Okay. Thank you David. ","Operator","The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and dividend boost. Maybe I\u2019ll also try my hand on this Q4 outlook question. Because I still don\u2019t know whether this is a top down forecast or it\u2019s a bottoms up forecast because with specific end market is going down sequentially so much for your overall sales to go down 10%.","And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s actually the other segment which had very strong growth in Q3 and I know Dave you mentioned on an year-on-year basis but last year I believe your sales were down in Q4. So the comps should have been easier versus the last year, so that\u2019s really my first question that is this top down forecast or is this a bottoms up forecast.","Kevin March","I think Dave has probably answered that same question about three or four times now and the answer still going to be the same. It is our best outlook right now based up on a continuing weak macro economy. We had a book-to-bill in 3Q of 0.99 compared that to 1.0 a year ago. So the visibility into the quarter is a little bit reduce versus it was a year ago.","There is no one market, no one customer, no one product, it is our best estimate at this point in time. And I\u2019ll remind you it does include a range and that range probably comprehends to high probability where will land fourth quarters.","David Pahl","And I just add the fact that whenever we\u2019ve had a big discontinuity that you\u2019re searching around for, we\u2019ve been clear at following those things out. So we want to be able to provide that transparency when it\u2019s necessary. So do you have a follow-on.","Vivek Arya","Yes. Thank you. Now given the focus on free cash flow, why isn\u2019t TI better utilizing an asset like your balance sheet because you\u2019re operating, if my numbers are right at about 0.15 net debt to trailing EBITDA and most of your peers are comfortable operating at three to four times. So given this low growth environment and sort of negative returns for holding cash, why is TI holding so much cash and why not buyback more of your stock if you think M&A looks expensive or not attractive right now. Thank you.","Kevin March","I think its now you consider our stock quite undervalued at the moment in times. I appreciate that observation. We have been buying back shares every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2004 our method for buying back shares is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it.","More importantly what we\u2019ve talked about is that we will buyback more shares when the price is lower and probably fewer shares when the price is higher. And so to that end we recently as with today\u2019s announcement have updated our allocation budget if you will for what we allocate in free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing four years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases.","To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now that balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past, we have been slowly paying that debt back down over time which means the debt is available today and important strategic opportunities present some at the right moment in time. We believe that leveraging now just for the sake of leveraging would actually block the balance sheet and being available should an opportunity present ourselves out there from a strategic standpoint.","David Pahl","Okay, great. Thank you, Vivek. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","The next caller is Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. I\u2019ve a question and a follow-up as well. I guess just starting on the dividend increase that you guys announced. Could you just talk about as I think about the future dividend payout strategies you guys have? Is it going to be more reflection of your free cash flow growth on an annualized basis or with the desire be to increase dividends along with free cash flow growth plus increasing the payout as you get to the midpoint of this 50% to 80% range. So how do I think about this on an annual basis?","Kevin March","Well, I think if you think about that what you have been seeing is probably what you will see and that is our free cash flow has been growing consistently for quite a few years now. And our formula design means that by definition are dividends are increasing consistent with that. What this new range does is just give us more framework to adjust the allocation between dividends and stock buybacks. We call it that we take all the free cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to buyback going forward.","If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases. So that\u2019s what this new range is designed to do is to give us more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuations that we see out there. Do you have follow-on Amit?","Amit Daryanani","Got it. If I can just follow-up, your R&D is sort of increased doubled-digit the few quarters. It sounds like, it will do so again. Does that suggest that you kind of shifting a little bit from harvesting towards investing more in your business? And if that\u2019s the case, should we recalibrate expectations maybe in calendar 2017 and 2018 that the share again that you guys are typically out 30, 40, 50 basis points could be somewhat higher given all the investments you\u2019re making?","Kevin March","Well, certainly we\u2019re investing more in the R&D with the intent of continuing our share gains and ideally accelerating them. And really what we\u2019re doing on the stuff, we are being very disciplined on R&D as well. We\u2019re not spending just for the sake of spending, but we\u2019re spending because we have a higher degree of confidence and the ideas are coming to us that we can actually turn that into profitable revenue growth and ideally market share.","And we\u2019re doing that by just reallocating our internal resources as we mentioned, meaning we\u2019re not taking our total spending up, but we\u2019re taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing lines or people who may have been working in sales or general administrative areas and putting them into working on R&D projects as well. So it\u2019s an overall reallocation internally and I would expect that that will continue to support our market share gains as we go forward.","David Pahl","Yes. I would add that we\u2019ve gained on average 30 to 40 basis points of market share and I think we\u2019ve gained share each of the last six years. I think we\u2019re on track to be able to put a seven figure up and we\u2019ll wait for the numbers to get posted before we declare that. But again, market share just doesn\u2019t move quickly in the markets that we\u2019ve got and I think that just speaks to the quality of the market. So I think these opportunities that Kevin just talking about just gives us confidence that we can continue to have share gains into the future. Thanks, Amit and we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. ","Ian Ing","Yes, thank you. In your prepared comments, you talked about being opportunistic in terms of purchasing assets ahead of demand, so do you anticipate any greater opportunities or fire sales as the industry I would say rapidly consolidates. I mean, you probably got enough wafer fabrication equipment, but maybe there\u2019s other areas like test and packaging? Thanks.","David Pahl","Yes. Ian, I would say that we are continuously on the lookout for buying assets that we don\u2019t need now, but we believe we will need at some point in time, it could be a strategic cost advantage to us at some point in time and we have been in pretty much every quarter, picking up some piece of equipment here or there.","But again, we look at the total opportunity, meaning, can we get the right price and can it be something that will contribute to our free cash flow as we go forward and so we look at it in that context when we consider these sorts of things. So I would expect that we will continue to be out there, making opportunistic acquisitions. Some may rise to the level of an announced, but most of them are probably just remain as they have been just spot purchases that we do from time to time as we look around the world.","David Pahl","Yes, and I\u2019ll also point out we\u2019re making those purchases while keeping our CapEx at about 4% of revenues, so continuing to strengthen that competitive advantage. Do you have follow-up Ian?","Ian Ing","Yes, over to embedded processing. Questions on expectations for DSP applications, should we think of it is largely communication infrastructure 4G and 5G. I noticed there is DSP, IT companies out there, they are talking about using these chips as accelerators for things like Deep learning, artificial intelligence accelerating some applications.","David Pahl","Yes, I think when you look at our portfolio that the lines between what the DSP and what\u2019s not a DSP blur to some degree so like you said in the comm\u2019s equipment space you\u2019ve got processors that have multicourse of both arms and DSP\u2019s but also have a heavy component of hardware accleators.","Our OMAP products that are gaining traction and automotive and other applications inside of industrial have DSPs inside of them. If you look at our communication products where we support over a dozen different standards that help machines be connected and be smarter, they will have now DSP inside of them.","So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology, the good news is that that business complements our analog product portfolio, very well it isn\u2019t one type of product or technology that\u2019s building that business. We\u2019ve got a very good diversity of customers that we\u2019re building over time. So we\u2019re encouraged by the confidence in the sustainability of that revenue and the wires underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it. But the business model is what\u2019s really encouraging for us. So okay, we can go to - have time for one more caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes, guys thanks for squeezing me in here. Kevin I guess my first question is you talked about OpEx being down sequentially in December quarter. Depending upon how much down sequentially it is, you could still have gross margins kind of flat to up in the December quarter and notwithstanding the revenue decline, you\u2019ve had in prior quarters were down revenue doesn\u2019t necessarily mean down gross margins. So kind of curious how you think about gross margins going into the calendar fourth quarter and what leverage you can still pull other than just volume to keep moving gross margins up into the right.","Kevin March","John, I think you know that we normally don\u2019t try to give that precise of forecast other than just topline and bottom line and earnings. But I would just remind you that, just like 3Q benefited from lower costs we increased production in the 300-millimeter and depreciation rolling off. Depreciation will continue to roll off and 300-millimeter will continue to become a bigger portion of wafers that we start. So you\u2019ve got a number of underlying cost things that will continue to give us good results on the overall gross margin for those who are interested in that number.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And then Dave I guess is my follow-up. You talked about your largest customer in Personal Electronics being down year-over-year in the September quarter. Do you think that\u2019s an accurate reflection of kind of their unit demand or is there something going on with your content or your pricing? Would you expect that customer to be down again year-over-year in the December quarter?","David Pahl","Well I will say that I\u2019m not going to make any comments on their command. And with most of our large customers if I\u2019ll just generalize the comment, most of our large customers will be on some type of consignment or hub based systems. So there is usually not a large delay and the demand when it actually gets pulled and when it\u2019s used. There\u2019s always an exception to that overall.","From a content standpoint, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before that we sell hundreds of products into our largest customers including our largest one and we continue to see win new products. So we\u2019re confident in the design wins that we\u2019ve got and the revenue that will drive overall. Okay, well thank you John for your call.","End of Q&A","David Pahl","Thanks everyone for listening tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation."],"20003":["Texas Instruments, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management strategy on February 4 at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.","For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter; second, I'll provide some comments about what we're seeing with added insight by segment and end market and explain why we would characterize the market as showing signs of stabilizing; and finally, since this is the end of the calendar year, I'll provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2019. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which we'll open the call for Q&A.","Starting with a high-level summary of the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was $3.35 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago, and EPS was $1.12 per share, including a $0.01 benefit not in our original guidance. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance with a relative strength across all markets.","At the company level, our year-on-year decline abated slightly from 11% in the third quarter to 10% in the fourth quarter. While this is only a marginal improvement, all end markets reduced the rate of decline substantially with the exception of communications equipment where the year-over-year decline increased about as expected given the strength in this end market in the year ago quarter.","In fourth quarter 2019, Analog revenue declined 5% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Analog's year-on-year rate of decline went from 8% in the third quarter to 5% in the fourth quarter, and Embedded's decline slightly increased from 19% to 20% over the same period.","When we look at the market, since 90 days ago, we moved from the third quarter where customers were increasingly cautious to the fourth quarter where results and behavior throughout the quarter reflected what we believe is best described as demand stabilizing. Based on history, this would imply that customer and channel inventory that built up during 2017 and '18 would now mostly be depleted. This suggests that demand this year will be more a function of our customers' end demand and, therefore, the macro economy, which may continue to be uncertain.","Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the fourth quarter by segment and end market. From the year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 5% due to declines in Signal Chain, High Volume and Power. Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% from the year ago quarter primarily due to Processors, Connected Microcontrollers also declined. Our Other segment declined 24% from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog declined 5% and Embedded declined 17%. Analog and Embedded combined were 92% of revenue.","From an end market perspective, in the fourth quarter, all markets declined year-on-year 3% to 4%, with the exception of communications equipment. Communications equipment declined about 50% from the year ago quarter, about as expected as all major customers, geographies and technologies declined.","Next, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2019. We break this into six categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 36%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 23%; communications equipment, 11%; enterprise systems 6%; and other was 3%.","Looking at the changes versus 2018, automotive increased by 1 percentage point, enterprise systems decreased by 1 percentage point and the remaining markets were unchanged.","In 2019, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, up 1 percentage point from last year and up from 42% in 2013. We've established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead.[","Next, one of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity, which can be measured in multiple dimensions. From a diversity perspective, we have over 100,000 customers and tens of thousands of devices. In 2019, almost 2\/3 of our revenue came from customers who bought $100 million or less of our products. In 2019, our top 10 devices represented about 5% of our revenue, and the top 100th device was less than 0.1% of our revenue. From a longevity perspective, over 40% of our revenue came from devices that we've been producing for at least 10 years. Our investments are directed to continue to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage.","Next, we are announcing today that we will be closing our last 2 6-inch or 150-millimeter wafer fabs, which are both more than 50 years old. This will be a multiyear plan and is expected to be completed no earlier than 2023 and no later than 2025. There are no charges in this quarter's results, and we'll keep you updated as needed in the future.","Separately, our plans to build our next 300-millimeter factory in Richardson, Texas, are underway with dirt moving and cranes on site. We expect the building shell to be complete by the end of 2021 and ready to install tools when needed to meet market demand, which will allow us to continue to support growth and strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage.","So to wrap up, we remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products. We remain focused on the industrial and automotive markets, the best markets and still be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $798 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue.","For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We're pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $50 million. Acquisition charges will remain at about $50 million through the third quarter of 2021.","Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42%, down from 47% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 25%, down from 30% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Other income and - net income in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.12 per share, which included a $0.01 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $163 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.8 billion, down 4% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends, an increase of 17% per share, marked our 16th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $489 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.3 billion. In total, we have returned $6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividends represented 52% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%. Inventory days were 144, down eight days from a year ago and up five days sequentially. We are pleased with our inventory, and it is positioned to support growth.","Now let's look at some of these results for a year. In 2019, cash flow from operations was $6.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $847 million or 6% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2019 was $5.8 billion or 40% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to owners.","Over the last 12 months, we paid $3 billion in dividends and purchased $3 billion of our own shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2019 and by 46% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.14, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our 2020 annual operating tax rate to be above 15%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data.","In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages with our manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Congratulations on the solid results. I guess, Dave and Rafael, just relative to the March quarter guidance, at the midpoint, you're guiding down about 3% sequentially, which is in line with kind of historic seasonality for the March quarter. But typically, off the bottom of the cycle, you can get some above seasonal. And at the midpoint, the year-over-year is just modestly getting better from December to March. So I'm just wondering what - if there's anything specific in the March quarter as to why it's not a little bit better than seasonal, and specifically, anything around distribution strategy that might be a headwind in Q1. And then I have a follow-up.","Dave Pahl","Yes, John, I'll take that, and Rafael can add if he'd like. I think - so to answer the last part of that question, there's nothing in the sequential guidance that would suggest there's any headwinds from distribution. We've talked about before that we would expect as we make the transition in distribution, it will look similar from a revenue headwind as we've seen with consignment. So there will be some there, but we've already got some of the headwinds from the transitions that we've made in consignment.","And I think the second part is as we're seeing those signs of stabilization, we talked about that history would suggest that the growth is going to reflect the end demand of the customers and, therefore, the macro economy. So as we go through the year, that's what will be the driving force overall.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. The only other thing I would add is, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, our comms equipment was down year-on-year significantly as there was a tough compare a year ago. Well, 1Q '20 is going to have an even tougher compare on comms equipment. You may recall what was going on in 1Q '19 on that front.","Dave Pahl","Right. Was growing pretty significantly year-on-year. Okay, John, do you have a follow-on?","John Pitzer","Yes. And then my second question is just around the Embedded business. I know that the SIA MCU data is not necessarily the best proxy for that business. But when you kind of compare your results to that data, up until this most recent correction, you guys were sort of consistently outgrowing the SIA MCU data. Your Embedded business has now gone through 5 or 6 quarters of kind of undergrowing. And I'm just wondering if you could help us talk through maybe potential share loss. And I know you talked about CPU specifically being weak within Embedded, is that specific to an end market like comms? Or how do we think about that?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So first, John, I think you're putting in a good context. And as you've stated, we believe share changes just need to be judged over long periods of time. And so if you look at the revenue performance of Embedded over the last several years, we've had that significant outperformance, as you pointed out, in '17 and '18. Last year, we probably gave some of that back. So I just point out that in the most recent quarter, at the TI level, so Analog and Embedded, we saw that - those signs of stabilization but - in every market, so behaving similarly except communications equipment. So thank you, John.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Trying to get to the trajectory and maybe the stabilization in turn. Dave, I know you said it was pretty broad-based on how you upsided the fourth quarter of last year. But can you give us what the sequential changes were by the end markets? I know you gave the year-over-year specifically, but if you could give that for the fourth quarter, that would be helpful.","Dave Pahl","Yes, certainly, Ross. So these are all sequential compares. Industrial declined mid-single digits. Automotive was about even. Personal electronics declined high single digits. Comms equipment declined about 20%. And enterprise systems grew in the low single digits. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?","Ross Seymore","Yes. I just wanted to think about the - you talked about shutting down the two 6-inch fabs. You told us about starting up the 300-millimeter. So maybe a two parter, if I may. Can you talk about the utilization plans in the first quarter? And how do we think about CapEx? I know you said you're moving dirt and you have cranes there, but out of that $600 million or $700 million cost that you said for the new 300-millimeter fab, how does that fold in, in 2020?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. So Ross, you asked a bunch of questions there. Let me try. I'll answer the ones I remember. So first, let me emphasize, yes, we're closing two - our two fabs that still have some 150-millimeter equipment. And they're over 50 years old, and they'll be closed by as early as 2023 or as late as 2025, somewhere in that time frame. We have about $1.5 billion of revenue that run through those factories. And of course, we're moving most of that revenue, virtually all, to 300-millimeter, saw a significant cost advantage, as we have talked about over the years.","The new factory, so let me talk about the new factory. Yes, we've got dirt moving, cranes are there, plans are underway. We should have the building finished by the end of 2021. And at that point, we can put equipment as needed to support demand. From a CapEx standpoint, you want to model that at 6% of revenue. We just finished 2019 with CapEx at 6% of revenue, and you should model that going forward at about that same level.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Danley, Citigroup.","Christopher Danely","I'm going to put the hindsight as 2020 theory to the test here. So now that we've kind of gone through this dip and recovery, maybe just talk about why you think your sales and bookings fell off so sharply in late summer. And then what's - why are the customers a little more, I guess, a little more optimistic right now? And then do you feel better about your business now versus, let's call it, six months ago over the summer?","Dave Pahl","Okay. Well, I'll start off, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. I think as we go through any cycle, they're all similar in a lot of ways and different in others. And to put it in context, you'd have to go back to third quarter of '18. Running up to that, we had 10 quarters of year-on-year growth. So you never know as you're going through that you're going to have 10 or 12 or 14 quarters of year-on-year growth, but you expect at some point that the industry would run below. And so as we started that, we thought we were - what we were seeing was mostly an inventory - industry, rather, correction as we're working through that. Certainly, trade tensions, probably elongated that cycle and part of the reasons why we saw that other leg down later last year.","And so - and can you remind me the second part - or do we feel better about the business. I think that strategically, we felt that we continue to stay focused on improving our four competitive advantages. We haven't slowed down investments, and we talk about our fabs underway. If you look at the OpEx investments that we have made, those have stayed steady, focused on areas of diversifying our growth in industrial and automotive. So I think we feel just as good today as we did about the business. The cycles will come and go.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. I would just add, as Dave mentioned, strategically, we are well positioned, have been, that hasn't changed. So we continue to feel as good as ever on that front. And then operationally, we just - we've got to be ready for whatever the market throws at us. So if this was - is going to last longer, we've got to be ready for that, if things are going to head south, but we also got to be ready if things turn around, and then we're going to start seeing year-on-year growth. So - and our business model allows us to do that, and we're well positioned for it.","Dave Pahl","Great. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher Danely","Yes. Just a longer-term question on the Embedded Processing business. So if you look at the last couple of years, it has materially undergrown the overall business, and we're still running it, I think it's about 10% lower margins than the corporate average. So what are you guys thinking about? What should we be thinking about sort of the long-term goals or aspirations for the Embedded business just in terms of relative revenue growth or profits? Do we expect it to improve or not improve? And if it's not going to improve, is there anything you could do to change that?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. I'll give you a few comments on that. As far as expectations, you mentioned margin. Frankly, that's not - Embedded is lower margin than Analog, but that is a nonissue. As long as their - Embedded contributes to free cash flow growth, that's the measure in stake. Obviously, the top line has gone through some challenges here that Dave talked about earlier. But longer term, with their focus on auto and industrial, in all of our businesses, but that includes Embedded, we feel confident that, that business will grow longer term.","Dave Pahl","Great. Thank you, Chris.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I was hoping to better understand what you're seeing in the comms business. I appreciate the year ago quarter was a high compare, but the business was down 50%, as Dave you noted. Curious how big Huawei was as a percentage of that decline in Q4. And more importantly, how are you guys thinking about the trajectory for this business into 2020? And then I have a follow-up.","Dave Pahl","Sure. Yes. So Huawei last year was 3% to 4% of our revenue. That's really unchanged from what it was the prior year. And I think if you look at comms equipment overall, if you'll just look at the shape of the growth curve, you had the year kind of balanced with strong growth in the first part and followed by very weak growth in the second half. So the way that it's behaving, I don't think is - well, it isn't a surprise to us. As we were going through that very strong growth, we tried to remind everyone at the time that, that market is a market that's just choppy. And it's that way primarily in early phases of technology deployment. I think longer term, as we've talked about on our capital management presentation, we don't believe that, that will be a growth driver for us or for the industry, and that's just based on the number of subscribers that are out in the market and what the capital spending by operators will be longer term. So we really think that growth in our industry will be driven by industrial and automotive, and hence, why we've biased our investments into those areas. Do you have a follow-on?","Toshiya Hari","Yes, great. And sort of related to that, Dave, it was encouraging to see R&D intensity or R&D as a percentage of sales pick up in 2019 versus 2018. I mean it had felt like R&D was in decline for a number of years, so it was good to see that pick up. Can you remind us which product areas, technologies, end markets that you guys are focused on? I realize it's going to be industrial and automotive, but if you can give a little bit more color within those two end markets, that would be helpful.","Rafael Lizardi","So of course, from an end market standpoint, as you said, is industrial, automotive, that's where we're focusing. From a product standpoint is Embedded and Analog. But of course, inside of that, there's a bunch of pieces. So I'll mention a few. But I mean, at the highest level is - in the case of Analog is Signal Chain and Power. Those are by far the biggest areas. But - and underneath that, there's just a bunch of things. There's the - within Power, there's all kinds of power categories and then within Signal Chain. But Dave, do you want to add something?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I'll just say when we think of allocating capital to R&D, there's really three major buckets. And the largest bucket is - goes directly to product - creation of new products. We release 300 to 400 new products a year. The other two is kind of a shared, centralized R&D function that develops our process technologies, packaging tools that our engineers use like SPICE models and those types of things.","And then the third category is the Kilby Labs where longer term, higher risk investments are made, new materials, new markets and those types of things. So that's where the R&D has been directed.","I describe R&D last year as steady and stable. And I think that even in a down market, keeping those investments stable, keeping focused on investing in our four competitive advantages is really important overall. So thank you, Toshi.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Looks like the year-over-year declines have improved quite a bit in auto and industrial, moving from down high single digits year-over-year to down low single digits going from September to December. Of the 18 subsegments within these two end markets or by geography, where do you guys see signs of improvement? Or was it pretty broad-based?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So it is the latter. It was very broad-based, which I think continues to be encouraging on that front. And again, just given the diversity of our customers as well as the diversity - the intentional diversity of our investments to have that growth be broad-based, it's good to see that that's the way the business is performing. Do you have a follow-up?","Harlan Sur","Yes, absolutely. As you guys mentioned, looks like the team is now shipping to consumption. The guidance for this quarter is for a seasonal decline. But given that Q2 and Q3 are typically seasonally stronger quarters, do you guys anticipate increasing factory loadings here in the March quarter?","Rafael Lizardi","We only talk about utilization and factory loadings when there's significant inflection points. And in this particular comparison, fourth to first, we don't expect a significant inflection point. So we're not talking about it. Of course, wafer load utilization is always a function of what we expect for future growth.","Dave Pahl","Yes. And we'll vary those based on order patterns and as we see demand come in from customers. So thank you, Harlan.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava","I just wanted to peel back the comments on stabilization. Both these businesses, industrials and autos and specifically, industrials, I forget, but I think there's 12, 13 subsegments. So when you talk about stabilization, I'm assuming - well, you never had any channel inventory buildup. Your channel inventory was pretty normal through the cycle and your lead times never extended out. So can you just help us understand a little bit what's the source of stabilization? Is it - it can't be the channel. So it's the end customer, but then you have thousands of end customers. So what's the right way to think to get comfort that you are seeing stabilization in that business specifically?","Dave Pahl","Well, Ambrish, yes, so it's reflected in the - stabilization is reflected in the order patterns, the demands that we see through consignment and actually the results themselves. So we went from third quarter where those markets were declining high single digits, 8%, 9%, some of them at 10%, to where all those markets were declining at 3%, 4%. So in those numbers, it suggests that there's a bottoming process.","And even though we're holding - in consignment programs, we're holding that inventory on our balance sheet, certainly, our customers have inventory of their products and then they have inventories that are down their channels. So just as the bullwhip effect would suggest that you have a small change in end demand as that moves its way back, that magnifies. So we can see the results of that beginning to abate. Do you have a follow-on?","Ambrish Srivastava","I did. Free cash flow margin. So you guys have powered through the 25%, 35% range you had given a couple of years ago. And you just had 40% in revenues down, not getting the math right, but somewhere in the high single digit, and free cash flow is down 4%. So would it be fair to assume that the targets should be moved up when we hear you talk about capital allocation in a couple of weeks from now?","Rafael Lizardi","So let me take that. So thanks for the cue on that. So we do have the capital management call coming on February 4. So I expect all of you to sign up for that and join us there. And we will talk about the various objectives there. But I'll give you a preview. We're not changing those objectives and specifically, that one that you talked about, we're not. And the reason for that, yes, we just finished a 40% free cash flow as a percent of revenue, but the focus is not that percent, right? The way we maximize value for the owners of the company is growing their free cash flow per share for a long time to come. So we focus on that, and that's how we drive value.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Ambrish.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","First of all, coming back to the sort of recovery question, I mean, stabilization and eventual recovery. Are you starting to see backlog further out now? Or do you think it's kind of more just in time and kind of just waiting for how macro unfolds throughout the year?","Dave Pahl","Yes, Tore. Now just for those that aren't as familiar with us, I'll just remind everyone or just point out that 2\/3 of our revenues are supported by consignment where we actually don't carry backlog but we do get demand forecast. And most of the time, that's at least six months of demand that we can see. So - and then there's no inventory. As Ambrish was pointing out in his earlier call, there's no inventory between us and those manufacturing lines for those customers.","So that's actually the strongest signal that we will get when we're looking at future demand. But certainly, the backlog pays - plays a part of that. So I'd just say that, in general, that it's consistent with the outlook that we have. And our lead times haven't changed - it hasn't really changed at all. So they have remained stable. So that allows customers to have confidence that they can get product when they need it. So do you have a follow-on?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. And I apologize for ending on this topic, but there's a lot of concerns about China in-sourcing, including Analog and Embedded Processing. I was just wondering what the company's strategy is on that topic. I mean is it - is sort of life is normal? Or do you actually have a long-term strategy as it relates to that particular topic?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I'll start and if Rafael wants to add anything. And certainly, as we worked through the year with the trade tensions and as that has unfolded, we've certainly heard discussions at Chinese customers, them wanting to ensure that they've got alternatives. But in the end, our customers are just very pragmatic, and they're looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost, the most dependable delivery. And those are all areas that we're very, very strong competitively in. With that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up.","Rafael Lizardi","All right. So let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember. We will remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products, and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. And lastly, we believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you for joining us tonight.

Today's call is being recorded, and at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter.","In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.97 which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.","With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago.","We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.","From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all three product lines, power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later.","Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago and sequential periods. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.14 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue, in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.","Operating profit was $1.25 billion, or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.","Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.","In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners.","Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year on year for 52 consecutive quarters.","In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.","Turning to our outlook for second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit.","Before moving to Q&A, there are three changes that I want to explain to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new GAAP standard that impacts the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our effective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impact. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance just as we did this quarter.","To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer term models. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates which include discrete tax items translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models.","If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter to quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete tax items as well as the retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com\/ir. Hopefully providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard.","The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website","The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. They were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as other income and expense rather than in revenue as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results","Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll take our first question in the queue. This will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. From a product and end market perspective, it appears that demand is relatively broad based. I'm wondering if you can comment on demand by geographies. I'm assuming that that's also fairly broad based as well, but wanted to see if there were any regions which are exhibiting any weakness.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, Harlan. Yes, I would say that the demand was very broad based and included regionals. Year over year, revenue was up in Asia, Europe and the U.S. And revenue was about even in Japan from a year ago. You have a follow up?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Auto, a solid market for the team last year with that end market up 23%. I think you mentioned that it's up double digits again in March. You've got a very diversified business here as well. There's been some concern around the global auto markets and the potential for a slowdown, given indications that production and\/or demand after two solid years might start to slow. Just wanted to get the team's sense on the health of this market kind of near to midterm.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. I definitely, as we stated in the opening remarks, that we saw our demand for our products in automotive continued to be strong. And so like you said, we've built that business across a very diverse set of sectors. And in fact, we've got five sectors inside of automotive. So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive.","And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1%, or a little more than 1% of the sales price of a car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year timeframe have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's we continue to invest in it, and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Thanks, Harlan.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll now move to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask about OpEx. Did that come in in line with your original plan for the quarter or was it different? And how should we think about the OpEx trajectory into Q2?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. Thanks for the call. I'll handle that one. On OpEx, everything came in about as expected. What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx, high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half. And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that. So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines.","If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level first to second, I would remind you that second quarter does have three months of higher pay and benefit raises versus only two months in first quarter. So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, yes I do. On your capital management update from a month or two ago, you had given some indicators of where 300-millimeter loading was, but it only went up a little bit in 2016. I think it went from about $2.2 billion year over year to $2.5 billion, so maybe $300 million, suggesting a good amount of headroom left for that transition to continue. How should we expect that trajectory to evolve this year in 2017? Is it just dependent on growth? Is there volume in 200-millimeter that's ramping down as 300-millimeter is ramping up? Like how should we think about where that might end up exiting this year in a normal demand environment?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yeah, Stacy, in the capital management update, if you remember, we talked about the fact that we've put in place about $8 billion of 300-millimeter capacity. Last year we had, as you stated, about $2.5 billion, so we're in a great position to be able to support growth. And essentially, we've been releasing for sometime now really probably going back to 2010, almost all of our new Analog products to 300-millimeter.","So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter. And if you look at last year, that came pretty close to what happened. So we had about $300 million of growth, so it's very consistent with that. So, thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll now move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, you were kind enough in your prepared comments to go through end markets in the March quarter on a year over year basis. I think the comm equipment was the only market you gave sequential color. I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about the sequential growth into March. It was well above seasonal and sort of in the same vein, to your guidance in June, you're guiding below seasonal. So how should we think about that from an end market perspective?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. So a couple of things. We thought the comms equipment market has been choppy in recent past, so we thought that that would be helpful, and that's why we provided it. If I'd just comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong. It increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we ship into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that fit inside of that. So it's very, very broad based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even.","So, when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggests that it would be up 9%. And if you look at that, John, on a year on year basis, the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%. So we think that that's fairly robust growth inside of the second quarter. So you have a follow-on, John?","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-on, I might have missed this and I apologize, but did you give an orders number for the quarter? And just in general, how are lead times either of your products or your competitors' products, because there has been some buzz that perhaps lead times within the industry are starting to stretch out?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. So orders were up 14% year on year to $3.5 billion. They were up about 2% sequentially. And I think from a lead time standpoint, our lead times have remained stable. And just as important as that, our on-time delivery metrics also remain very high. So our shipping to our commitments that we make to customers remain very high. So with that said, we do have some isolated process and package combinations where lead times have stretched, but we've worked very aggressively on those. So we're very pleased with where we are to be able to keep ahead of demand. Well thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll now move to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on inventory, Dave. I guess exiting the quarter, inventory days were at 132 days, toward the high end of your guided range. How comfortable are you with that level? And what are you seeing in terms of the distribution channel?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, we are \u2013 well, I'll answer our inventory days and then I'll let Dave comment on the disti channel. But we're comfortable with our inventory days. It's well within our range. Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth. And the other key point to remember is as we have focused our strategy more on industrial, automotive and on catalog type of parts, the risk of obsolescence on this part is really minimal. So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, and from a disti standpoint, Toshiya, we saw our inventory days kind of remain near their current levels, at four weeks. That benefits from our consignment programs we have with our distributors. It actually was down sequentially, and it was down from a year ago. So we think that those are in good shape. Do you have a follow-on?","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A. You guys have been pretty consistent in the past, and you've pointed to valuation and the lack of opportunities as reasons to stay sidelined, but was hoping you could potentially give us an update there, if any changes.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, I'd be happy to comment. The update is no change. It's the same strategy for M&A. We looked at \u2013 we're always considering options and looking at things, but it has to be an opportunity that is focused on industrial, it's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog. So it has to be a good strategic fit from that standpoint. But then the other component that has to be there is that the numbers have to make sense. So when we have both of those combinations, then we are willing to move forward on considering that further.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Thank you, Toshiya. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move now to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions from me as well. I guess one, fairly impressive growth in the Analog side. I think it was up like 20% year over year. Is there a way to think about the growth in the segment excluding the consumer side, where I think you may have had somewhat easier comps? Just trying to get a sense of what the baseline number could be on Analog as you go through the year.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. I think first of all, let me just make a comment at the company level. We talked about that the demand was driven from the strength that we saw in the industrial market as well as automotive. That represented about 70% of the growth, and certainly we did benefit and see growth inside of personal electronics off of the easy compare, as we all remember a year ago that we were working through an inventory correction in that particular end market. So the great news is that's very consistent with what we saw inside of Analog, and so the growth is very, very broad based. So we've got contributions from the industrial market, contributions from the automotive market, and as well as we did see contributions from the personal electronics market. So do you have a follow-on?","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I do. I guess just in the automotive segment, could you just talk about if there's a way to think about maybe what percent of your auto revenues today are infotainment-centric versus more mandate driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety? And is there a way to think about the geographic split in the auto business as well? Thank you.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yeah, thanks. That's a great question, Amit, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on it. You know, I think that the great thing that we've been trying to do, or the thing that we've been trying to do and why we're happy with the results, is that our automotive business isn't just built on just either infotainment or an ADAS business. It really is broad based. So when we look at kind of the order of the sizes of those business, the infotainment is the largest. Safety systems is the second, followed by advanced driver assist systems, then power train, which includes hybrid and electric and then body, electronics and lighting.","So, and if you dive into any one of those areas, it's not dominated by one technology or one product. And we've got more than half of our 60 to 70 product lines that ship products into the automotive business. So we're very diverse from a product standpoint. We're also very diverse from a geography standpoint as well, so we're really seeing a benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos. So thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Apologies for, I guess first question, I got on a little bit late, so just have a point of clarification. In terms of the royalty commentary, the $30 million, was that included for Q1 as well? So net-net with that, top line would have been $30 million in gross margin, 100% of that $30 million better?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","And then from here, we should be using that same amount?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","So the change in royalties was included in our guidance, meaning that the royalties were in other income and expense, just like how they came in in results. And on a go-forward basis, they will stay in other income and expense. So for modeling purposes, you can look at how that other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to that on a go-forward basis.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you. And I guess as a follow up, can you walk through some of the work that you're doing on the gross margin side? It sounds like internally, the 75% is not enough and you want to take that higher. And would love to hear what you're working on, and I'm assuming that includes not only front end but back end manufacturing and would love to get an update there, if you could.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, sure. As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth. And that's what we're focused on industrial and automotive. Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces.","Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage, and that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin but more importantly, higher free cash flow, And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","And the next question will be Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm going to use up my first question on just a couple of revenue clarifications. So in response to an earlier question on the, I guess the stronger than expected revenue, so are you telling us that your automotive business was responsible for the upside in Q1 on revenue and comm was a little weak? And then on the Q2 guide, you're basically guiding up like 4.5%. That's below seasonality and also below what you guided sequentially for last year. So you're not seeing any weakness or no change in the Q2 forecasts over the last like month?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. So the first is that our revenue came inside of our guidance, and so we didn't really have any surprises there. If you look at all of the businesses and if you look at the end markets, we really saw strength across the board, Chris. So there really wasn't an area that we would point to that singularly drove the revenues in the quarter or from the midpoint of the guidance, if you will. So very broad based overall. And then secondly, again, I think going back to John's question, when we look at our sequential growth rates of kind of the low end of flat to up 9% or on a year on year basis of 4% to 13%, we think that that's a pretty strong second quarter. So do you have a follow-on?","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Just a longer-term question. I think you've talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around $18 billion in revenue capacity. What sort of revenue level would you start to need to order more equipment? I assume you wouldn't wait until you're 100% utilized before you start to put those orders in. Is it 90% utilization, 95%? Maybe give us some color there.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Well, I'll give you some color and then I'll let Dave chime in. But, we think of our strategy, as stated in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, and I'll just add, Chris, like you pointed out, we had a little over $13 billion in revenue last year. We've got just under about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. We have open 200-millimeter capacity inside of that footprint. So we've got plenty of room to grow for some time. But like Rafael said, if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it was at the right price, we'd make that move, because it is an asymmetrical bet. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll now move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and maybe I'll ask the same related question here. When you look at the guidance, well actually if you just look at the overall business, you're not the only ones seeing double digit year over year growth in all of your businesses. Even if you've taken out personal electronics, the rest of the business is up strong. And the commentary actually suggests that it remains strong. So I guess kind of two parts here.","One, how do you foot the gap between what, I know there is content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then I guess as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, so I think if you walk through the end markets, Blayne, as we've commented, automotive has remained strong. You saw that that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just one OEM or one car model or one end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning.","When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad based. Others are seeing it as well.","So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double ordering or seeing inventories build. I'd just make the comment that overall the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So, we have no indications that inventories are growing or double ordering, but I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see.","I mentioned earlier our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility into distribution inventory, and as I commented earlier, that remains steady, about four weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's in real good shape.","Our visibility into customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, actually our inventory, and they pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that that would suggest that there's an issue overall.","And our visibility into inventory, of course beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course is very low. So, as we have been doing for a long time with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focused on keeping lead times steady, and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence, that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great and I apologize. I missed the very beginning, so if you already said this, I apologize. But in terms of your guidance, I kind of get gross margins flattish, maybe down a little bit. I just wanted to make sure that that's the right range.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","The way I would comment on that is, we have said before that our revenues fall through between 70% and 75%. So if you do that math on a sequential basis, you'll get somewhere close to where you need to be.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","I'm sorry. We'll take a question now from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. You talked about how your investment priorities were in industrial and automotive. Can you give us some idea within automotive, are there specific types of products or specific capabilities that you're directing your investments at?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, David. As I mentioned before, we're very intentionally trying to make investments across a very broad number of areas. So they include things that are very popular like ADAS systems and infotainment systems, but also embody electronics and lighting. So we've commented before that that includes areas like turn signals. There's a couple of dollars of content in an LED turn signal and our sales teams get pretty excited about things like that. But also sensors on door handles and inside of the infotainment system, the touch buttons to control the AC or the audio system, haptic systems that may sit inside of the steering wheel or in driver's seats, and LED lighting inside of a car. There's a lot of areas. So we're really trying to direct that investment to be very, very broad based. Do you have a follow-on, David?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Well, similarly for industrial, you mentioned the 14 areas you were going to bore us with. Are there any additional areas on top of the 14 that you will be able to go into because of your investments?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, so I'll resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those. But if I just take one like Medical, as an example, that sits inside of there, there's literally hundreds of end equipment that will sit inside of medical. And if you think of at the high end, there may be a magnetic resonance imaging machine that may sell for millions of dollars, and then all the way down at the other end, you have a blood glucose meter that may sell for less than $50. So we actually have over 100 different end equipments that will sit inside of a sector like medical, and as we make investments, we look to funnel those investments, not just in one area like something like factory automation and control, as an example. We really want to funnel those investments on a very broad basis. So thank you, David, and we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll now move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. My first question on lead times. So you mentioned your lead times are very stable. You're maybe seeing some stretch in certain specific areas. But if you look at the general environment, does it feel like the supply chain is overly nervous about getting product, or does it feel like it's pretty controlled?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, Tore. Again, I can really only speak for what we see and what we're doing. And again, I think we're advantaged because we've got a large portion of our revenues on consignment, so we're actually controlling that inventory up and to the point that it gets pulled. We also, for many customers, we'll get long-term forecasts. Those consignment forecasts literally sometimes can be on an hourly basis, but certainly on a daily or weekly basis and typically go out for six months in some cases. Now that doesn't mean that they can't change very quickly, and we've seen that before in the past and they can strengthen or weaken and that usually happens very quickly. So again, our lead times are remaining very stable besides those isolated areas that we're working very aggressively to fix. The vast majority of our products remain stable. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. That's very helpful. As a follow up, I think you mentioned industrial strengthening. So I assume that means it's going to be up more in June than it was in March. And again, is that strength broad based, or is there any region that's waking up a little bit more than others? And I'm especially thinking about China, because there's been some recent weakness there. I'm just wondering if that region is holding up as well in industrial.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yeah, Tore, the comment was around the quarter that we reported, and we've seen industrial strengthen now for a number of quarters in a row. Our guidance for the second quarter, we just provide the top level and EPS. If there is anything that's unusual going on in an end market, we always provide that color to be helpful. And we haven't had to provide that obviously for second quarter. So thank you, and I think we've got time for one more caller, please.","Operator","The question will be from with Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on R&D and as it relates to OpEx. Rafael, you kind of articulated that the OpEx will be in the band that you have provided in the past, so no change there. But R&D on a year over year basis in absolute dollars has been growing, and in your last filing, you mentioned that you would be reallocating from manufacturing as well as SG&A into R&D. So just kind of like a two-part question is, one, what should be the trajectory of R&D as we model through the year? And then kind of related to that, qualitatively if you could help us understand where the focus is for the R&D investment. Thank you.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. Let me address the second part of that question first. That's clear, we've been focusing on industrial and on automotive. That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets. Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive, so those investments are paying off.","On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comments. We like, our stated goal or model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti.com, and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx 20% to 30% in stable times, in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx. Dave, you want to add?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, I'll just add, Ambrish. As you know, when we look at making investments, whether it's in R&D or in OpEx, as we pointed out in our capital management presentation that we gave earlier, investing in the businesses is a top priority. So, and what we're try to do, as Rafael indicated by market, but we also want to strengthen our four competitive advantages.","So those include the first one which is manufacturing and technology, ensuring that we're developing great process technologies and strengthening our position with 300-millimeter. The breadth of the portfolio is the second, and we've talked about that a lot and how that plays out through industrial and automotive. The third is the reach of our marketing channels and strengthening that, and that continues to be our investments in ti.com as well as how that's coupled with our sales force and apps teams. And then we want all those things to lead to the diversity and longevity, and that will lead to good free cash flow per share growth, and that's really what we want to do. Did you have a follow-up?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No, that was it. Thank you very much.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. Well thank you all for joining us tonight and a replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's call.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 9. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.","This was a good quarter for TI. Revenue came in just above the midpoint of our guidance range, growing 6% sequentially and growing 10% if you exclude legacy wireless revenue, which declined to less than 2% of TI revenue in the quarter. Analog and Embedded Processing increased to 80% of TI revenue. The improved quality of our revenue is reflected in record gross margin in the quarter. Kevin will discuss this more in a few minutes.","Revenue growth in the quarter was supported by some of the vertical markets that were especially weak in the second quarter, including computing, game consoles and handset revenue outside of our legacy wireless revenue. Revenue from the communications infrastructure market continued to grow in the quarter. These areas were complemented by a continued strength in our automotive and industrial revenue.","From a year ago, revenue declined 4% due to the decrease in legacy wireless revenue. Excluding this revenue, we grew 3% from the year-ago quarter. On this basis, this was the first quarter of year-on-year growth since the third quarter of 2012. Again, excluding legacy wireless, we expect growth to accelerate to 8% in the fourth quarter at the middle of our guidance range.","The strength of our business model not only provides strong profitability, it also gives us confidence that we can sustainably generate $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This metric is especially important to our shareholders as our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to them, except what is needed to repay debt. When measured over the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was 24% of revenue. Over that same period, we returned 133% of free cash flow to shareholders. In the third quarter alone, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.","Earnings in the third quarter were above our expected range, a result of better-than-expected revenue and gross profit, tight operating expense control and some help from discrete tax items.","Let me walk through a few details of revenue. Analog revenue grew 11% sequentially. All 4 Analog product lines contributed to this growth, although Power Management was up the most, followed by High Volume Analog & Logic. These areas benefited from sequential growth across many markets, including those vertical markets that were impacted by inventory reductions in the second quarter.","Embedded Processing revenue grew 8% sequentially, with processors up the most, followed by growth in microcontrollers and connectivity. Processors were driven by applications processor sales into consumer and automotive applications and DSP sales into industrial applications. Microcontrollers were lifted mostly by sales of MSP430 products into industrial applications, as well as sales of microcontrollers into automotive safety applications.","In our Other segment, sequential growth in both product areas was offset by decline in legacy wireless. Legacy wireless revenue fell by $91 million to $57 million as we had expected. This decline was partially offset by growth in calculators and in custom ASIC revenue, which grew as a result of communications infrastructure. Royalties also grew, and DLP product revenue was about even.","Turning to distribution. Resales grew 9% sequentially. Distributors' inventory levels declined by about a day to just over 5 weeks.","Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin P. March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, gross profit was $1.78 billion, up 13% sequentially. Gross margin was a record 54.8% of revenue and expanded 330 basis points sequentially. I think it is useful to compare this quarter's gross margin to that of the third quarter of 2010, wherein our last high-water mark for gross margin was set at 54.5%. In that earlier quarter, revenue was $3.74 billion, up -- 15% higher than our revenue this past quarter. Factory utilization in that earlier quarter was 8 points higher and our manufacturing capacity was lower since we have not yet brought online our cost-efficient, 300-millimeter analog wafer fab in Richardson, Texas or our yet to be acquired wafer fab in Chengdu, China. We were also still in the early stages of ramping our recently acquired Aizu Japan wafer fab. In addition, Analog and Embedded Processing were also much smaller then, contributing 60% of our revenue at that time.","The conclusion one can draw from this is that due to the structural changes that we've made at TI over the past few years, the quality of our revenue is much higher today. It is more diverse, more profitable and less capital intensive; and we remain better positioned to support future growth from a manufacturing capacity standpoint.","Continuing to operating expense. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $833 million was reduced by $27 million sequentially. Acquisition charges were $86 million, unchanged from last quarter. Almost all of this amount is the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. The restructuring charges and other line of our income statement transitioned from a $282 million gain last quarter to a $16 million charge this quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gain was due to the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer. This quarter's charge is associated with the shutdown costs from the previously announced factory closings in Houston and Hiji, Japan.","Operating profit was $844 million or 26% of revenue. Our tax rate in the quarter was 23%, a point below our 24% annual effective tax due to discrete items that were included in the third quarter. Our annual effective tax rate is unchanged and 24% is the rate you should use in your models for the fourth quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $629 million or $0.56 per share, which includes $0.01 of discrete tax benefits.","Let me now comment on our capital management strategy, starting with cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.15 billion in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $6 million compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days increased by 1 day to 106 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $1.03 billion.","On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.27 billion, about the same as a year ago. Trailing 12 months' capital expenditures were $402 million, down 27% from the year ago. As a result, free cash flow was $2.87 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 24% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. In the year-ago trailing 12 months period, free cash flow was 21% of revenue. Capital expenditures for the past 12 months were 3% of revenue. Our continued low capital spending level is a direct result of the strong capacity position that we have built with our strategic investments of the past few years. The cash flow that will result as we continue to fill up this capacity should be stronger in the years ahead.","I'll note that depreciation expense for the past 12 months exceeded our capital expenditures by $496 million. As a percent of revenue, depreciation was more than 400 basis points higher than our capital expenditures. This is one of the reasons why our free cash flow has been trending higher than our net income. Of course, as depreciation declines at the rate of capital spending over the next few years, gross margin will benefit. Another reason why free cash flow has trended higher than net income is the noncash amortization expense of $80 million to $85 million per quarter, that will remain on our income statement for another 6 years. For the past 12 months, amortization expense was $339 million or about 3% of revenue.","And as we've said, strong cash flow, particularly cash flow -- free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the third quarter, TI paid $308 million in dividends and repurchased $734 million of our stock. Our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders, except for what we need to repay debt. In the last year, we reduced our debt level by $500 million. Free cash flow was $2.87 billion and we returned a total of $3.82 billion to shareholders or 133% of free cash flow. We've been able to return more than our free cash flow because proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, totaling $1.28 billion over the past 12 months, have also been an additional source of cash for the company. To break out the cash return, in the past 12 months, we repurchased $2.7 billion of our stock or 95% of free cash flow. Similarly, we paid $1.08 billion in dividends or 38% of our free cash flow.","Fundamental to our cash return strategy and our cash management and our tax practices, we ended the third quarter with $3.59 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely onshore, it's readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders were about even sequentially and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.97, consistent with seasonal declines in the fourth quarter.","We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.86 billion to $3.10 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 8% sequentially, with about half of that decline coming from the seasonal drop in calculators. The remainder of the decline is consistent with the semiconductor industry's pattern over the past 3 years: 2010, 2011 and 2012, as well as our own history over that same period when legacy wireless revenue is excluded. In the fourth quarter, legacy wireless products should decline to about $50 million. We continue to expect that revenue from these products will essentially be gone as we enter next year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.50.","In summary, we believe the third quarter provides a preview of what TI is capable of producing as a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing. The improved quality of our revenue is evident from the higher gross margin and free cash flow generation compared with our past. We also believe our top line performance and potential will become more evident without the steady headwind of declining wireless revenue in the past few years. Our manufacturing capacity position remains strong and we have a good opportunity for continued growth, while maintaining our capital expenditures at lower levels in the years ahead.","With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ron, I guess my first question, just relative to that consumer bucket of computing, gaming and handsets, can you just give us a sense of how much that represented of the overall business in the September quarter and how much that was up versus the rest of the businesses sequentially?","Ron Slaymaker","John, probably the best I can do is help you understand the weight of each of those segments. I don't have the growth broken out by each of those areas for you. But let me just kind of go through real quickly the weighting of our end market exposure, which I can let you then play with to make some assumptions on. Comps in total were 27% -- and this is first half '13 data -- computing, 23%; industrial, 23%; consumer, 11%; automotive, 13%; and education, 3%. So again, the reason we called out the 3 areas was because I think in second quarter, we called them out as especially weak. And in fact, we also said that in our outlook for third quarter, we expected that they would recovery -- recover. And keep in mind, the reason they were weak in the second quarter was because customers in those areas were depleting inventories ahead of the anticipated new product launches in second half, which we are now well into. So those new product launches were what was driving -- were a factor in those areas that was driving growth. Again, comms infrastructure was already strong and growing in second quarter. It continues in third quarter; as was automotive and industrial, strong second quarter continued as well into the third quarter. Do you have a follow-on, John?","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I do. This is for Kevin. Just on the incremental gross margin, Kevin, if you look at both the June and September quarter, your incremental gross margin, both quarters were over 100%. I guess I'm just kind of curious, to what extent was that just the wireless business declining? Do I think about a 30% type gross margin there? And then more importantly, when the legacy -- when the wireless business is down to 0, how should I think about incremental gross margin from there?","Kevin P. March","Yes, John. On the -- I'll answer the last part first. The incremental gross margin from our analysis in the past, over the course of the cycle averages about 75% up and down. In any one quarter, it really actually works out to that number tends to be pretty noisy in any one quarter but over time, about 75% and that's what we do for internal planning purposes. As it relates to the most recent quarter, you're right, the fall-through was about 106%. So it's certainly a pretty rich fall-through. And part of that was mix, but part of that also was improved factory utilization as we had higher revenues this quarter than the prior quarter. And so consequently, we had a slight utilization benefit as well.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe from a high level, if you can just talk about now that we have -- you definitely showed increasing year-over-year growth. September was up and then December accelerating, although off of a pretty easy compare. For the full year, Analog growth seems more like a few percent. So if you could just talk about now that we have a full picture for the year, do you think there's anything going on in the Analog bucket? Or do you think that this is kind of representative of what the overall market is going?","Ron Slaymaker","Blayne, I think the year is not done and right now, there's kind of a lot of point spreads being made for our fourth quarter but we really need to wait until we get into January to understand what the final score is. But I think we feel pretty confident that 2013 when the final scores are in, we'll show market share gains once again for TI. So again, we have to push through the fourth quarter but we believe, just as you've seen over the past few years, once again, we'll be gaining share in 2013 for Analog overall. Do you have a follow-on?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just if you can provide some color as to within the segments in Analog, which one you're seeing the -- if there's any material difference between the subsegments. It looked like Power was up a bunch, if I have my numbers right, in September, if you could talk about the growth driver there. And then where you see the biggest declines into December.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. I think in the case of Power, Power had a strong quarter. But also, you used the term earlier, easy compare. It was one that's probably more impacted by weakness, so the inventory reductions and some of those vertical areas in the second quarter. So in the third quarter, its growth was very broad-based, but it also benefited from recovery in some of those vertical markets and then I would say the same for HVAL. So if you look at third quarter, probably because those vertical markets layered on growth to what was already a reasonable base of industrial and automotive, Power and HVAL both grew faster than the catalog spaces of HPA and SVA. Yet I think if you go back to first half of the year and especially second quarter, you probably saw more relative strength in SVA and HPA. So I guess to put it all together, they're all pulling well in terms of growth in 2013 thus far. We'll see where it takes, again, where we go through fourth quarter. But some quarters, you've had more strength out of SVA or HPA and other quarters, as in third quarter, more coming out of Power and HVAL. Okay, Blayne, thank you for your questions.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, can you give us an idea of what sort of we should be thinking for the other operating expenses? I know it seems to be moving around. I do know you had the assets last quarter. But x the asset sale, still a reasonable bit of spending there, can you give us some idea of what we should be budgeting for next year in terms of that line on the income statement?","Kevin P. March","Doug, I'm going to try to make sure I've got what you're asking for. OpEx overall for the company, our model is to run between 20% and 25% of revenue, depending upon where we're at in overall revenue demand. And most of that spending is actually inside the Analog and Embedded Processing segment. So it's relatively small levels of ongoing support spending inside the Other segment, a little bit of R&D inside the Other segment for DLP technologies. But other than that, pretty small. The larger numbers you'll see passing through the Other as we go forward will be the continued amortization of intangibles, which will run about $85 million a quarter as we go through 2014. And that will eventually decline into about $80 million a quarter. And keep in mind, that will stay there for 6 years until that finally winds down. In addition, that falls through where we tend to record any restructuring charges. So the restructuring charges that we just had this past quarter, over $16 million, and those also were recorded in the Other segment. As we look into the fourth quarter, I'd expect that you'll see acquisition charges continue at about the $85 million, $86 million level. And you'll see probably a final restructuring charges associated with the closure of our Hiji and Houston factories of about $20 million in the fourth quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","And Doug, I think if you look at the income statement for the company, all of the -- for the entire period of comparison here over the last 4 quarters, all of the acquisition charges and restructuring other line are directly from that Other segment. So with that, you can then, if you want to extract that out to see what R&D and SG&A trends have been in that Other segment, you'll see both -- you won't see them independently. But the combination of R&D and SG&A has gone down whether you look at it year-over-year or whether you look at it sequentially. And again, a large -- that's largely driven by the reductions in legacy wireless as Kevin noted. All right, Doug, do you have a follow-on question?","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. For my follow-on, if we look at the Embedded Processing business, that business growing nicely but not necessarily delivering the operating margins of the corporate average. Can you talk about what you're doing as far as the operating margin leverage to that business?","Kevin P. March","Yes. Doug, as you may recall, we spent a couple years significantly increasing our investments in that segment, particularly as it relates to microcontroller portion of that particular segment. We've taken that spending up to a level now that doesn't need to increase anymore. And really, what that business unit has focused on is the top line growth. They get rather attractive gross margins off their -- off the parts when they ship them. It's really about diversifying the revenue base and getting more overall top line growth to fall through to the bottom line. That's really what you just saw quarter-over-quarter. It's that top line growth came through rather nicely to the bottom line.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, Doug. Thanks for your questions.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First one is on operating expenses for the quarter. It looks like you guys saw OpEx decline about 3% versus the original guidance for down 2%. Wondering if there's any timing or any -- or how you guys were able to do better than your original guidance, and what the expectation process was?","Kevin P. March","Yes. So since -- OpEx, we did guide to down about 2%, but we're able to keep a pretty tight handle on spend in the quarter and so it came in a little bit lower than we had originally planned, which, frankly, just dropped by to the bottom line and produced extra earnings per share for our shareholders. As we look into the fourth quarter, we typically have some seasonality in the fourth quarter, what with the holidays for Thanksgiving and during the Christmas break. And so we'd expect to see OpEx probably decline somewhere in the 3% to 5% range as we move into the fourth quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Do you have a follow-on, Stephen?","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, one question on the Embedded Processing division, particularly the microprocessors. So with the MSP430 that you mentioned, I was wondering, is the consumer or wireless segment an area where you're looking to be more aggressive on expanding the sales of your MC products?","Ron Slaymaker","Well, I think probably the way to think about it, Stephen, is probably the biggest driver of growth for microcontrollers will be industrial. These are catalog devices that go into lots and lots and lots of different applications. That being said, we're not -- if there's growth in other end markets or growth opportunities in other end markets, we'll certainly pursue them. But our expectation is that industrial will likely be the largest driver going forward. And that's for the microcontrollers. For the processor side of the business, I would say we would expect comms infrastructure certainly is part of that revenue and an important end market for us. But similarly, we sell DSP products into lots of different applications. And the broader applications are going to be just as important, maybe even more important, than communications infrastructure going forward. And that's not -- that's not anything negative about communications infrastructure, it's just we have great market share, very high market share already in communications infrastructure, where there's still a lot of opportunity in some of these other areas for us to experience not only the rapid growth of that end market, but also rapid market share gains as well. Okay, Stephen, thank you for your question. And one of the things I should further delineate is when I'm talking about industrial likely being the fastest grower for microcontrollers, let me also more broadly include automotive in that as well, because that is a great opportunity that we're very well positioned with those products there. Okay, Stephen. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Your R&D spending as a percent of revenue is fairly low relative to some of your high-value peers. So what leads you to believe that you can maintain the growth, gain market share and the mix? Or do you think that there's a possibility of poising [ph] your R&D over time?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Tristan. Let me just, again, remind everybody of the R&D that you're seeing for TI. The R&D spend that we've had in the Analog segment has been at a pretty consistent level versus the revenues of that business for quite a few years now. And the fact of the matter is, the reality is, that, that R&D spend is being converted fairly efficiently into revenue growth to the point where that business continues to outgrow its competitors and gain market share each year. So I would offer to you that, that's actually a very efficient organization when it comes to our R&D spend. I can't explain why some of their competitors have to spend as much as they do. Similarly, in Embedded Processing, we've increased the spending over there, as I mentioned to the last question, over the last couple of years, largely to expand the opportunities that we can pursue in the microcontroller space. And so after bringing up that level of spending for a couple of years now, I'd say it's high enough at this point. And we now need to see it start converting into real revenue growth, which we're starting to see early signs of. When you look at total TI R&D, it is coming down product sharply. And that's purely a function of us winding down the legacy wireless products, including the announcement that we had that we're closing some of our operations and sites as it relates to that and that will take our total R&D spend down as we go forward. But on the core products of Embedded Processing and Analog, I have no hesitation of being comfortable with the level of R&D spend that we have in those areas today.","Ron Slaymaker","And Tristan, let me also just offer, in the Analog space, I would argue we're probably spending more than any of our competitors. You're looking as a percent of revenue, but if you look at absolute dollars, yes, yes, we're bigger in terms of revenue, but we're spending more than any competitor that I'm aware about in that space. So it's not like we're not investing in that business. We're investing quite heavily. All right, do you have a follow-on, Tristan?","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Certainly. And that's very useful. The part of your business that's non-consigned business, so distribution, is your Q4 revenue guidance embedding shipments about in line with end demand? Or any variance that you can mention relative to end demand and sell-in?","Ron Slaymaker","Oh, Tristan, I don't know that we have a real breakout in terms of the outlook between consigned versus non-consigned. We're really looking at it just in terms of what we shipped in -- or what we're shipping into that channel. So I don't specifically know the answer to that. I will point, if you just back to third quarter anyway as a reference point, I think we said TI's total revenue, excluding the legacy wireless, grew 10%; and our resales or sales out of the distribution channel, grew 9%. So you saw a very close alignment in the third quarter. I just don't have any specific data to share with respect to fourth quarter. The other thing I'll say, even with third quarter, we had a decline of a day of distribution inventory level. All right. Tristan, thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had one quick one on OpEx. Your R&D guide for the year still puts you about $1.5 billion, which would not -- which you said OpEx will be down like 4% and the midpoint of that would imply R&D down like 12%. Are you just rounding down to that $1.5 billion? Maybe could you give us a little more color on your expectations after the R&D and the assumptions around the OpEx?","Kevin P. March","Yes. Stacy, we do round to the nearest hundred million on all of these guidance numbers we give you, be it R&D or CapEx or any of the others. So in fact, there will be some rounding [indiscernible] there. But keep in mind also, the OpEx guidance I gave includes SG&A as well. And we will see that decline in the fourth quarter, really, on the seasonal patterns I mentioned a moment ago with the holiday periods going on.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I do. And just around, again, gross margins. It sounds like you got a bit more restructuring left over from the 6-inch fab closures in Q4. Have the benefits from those closures fully impacted gross margins? I think, in total, it was supposed to be about 75 basis points. And if they haven't fully impacted yet, can you give us some feelings for the trajectory of that impact on the margins?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Stacy. What we talked about when we announced that we were closing the -- those 2 over-6-inch factories is that once each one of them was closed, we'd see about $50 million per factory of cost savings on an annualized basis. One of those factories did close at the end of the second quarter, and the other one should close here in the fourth quarter. So we're beginning to see -- excuse me, third quarter. So we're beginning to see in the third quarter already partial benefit from that, and we should begin to see the benefit from that second factory closure materialize in the fourth quarter. So going into next year, we'll begin to see that $100 million of annualized cost savings as a result of closing those 2 older factories.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Stacy, thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First one, just on the Q4 outlook, I just wanted to make sure if there's been any downshift or conservatism regarding Q4 outlook. Because I think heading into the quarter, there was an expectation that looked macro trends are improving. Industrial businesses are doing better. There is this comms infrastructure build that the broader Analog industrial players would be able to give above-seasonal guidance. Maybe it was optimism. But since then, we have just seen sort of seasonal or slightly below seasonal outlook from Linear, from Cypress; and now, you're also guiding somewhat below Street expectations. So my first question is, has there been any conservatism regarding Q4 outlook? And specifically, what segments do you think will be at seasonal patterns versus below seasonal patterns for Q4?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Vivek. I'll go ahead and make some comments on that and let Ron add some additional color. But the -- if you take a look at our guidance, the midpoint of our guidance is down about 8%, third quarter going into forth. About half of that is just the seasonal decline that we normally get with the roll-off of the calculator business. So the other half is pretty much attributable to our underlying semiconductor business. If you take a look at -- we actually believe that, that's probably quite seasonal and, in fact, quite consistent. If you take a look, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, 2010, 2011, 2012, the semi industry as a whole, excluding memory, in fact has seen fourth quarter declines from third quarter in each of those past 3 years. And based upon the guidance that we're hearing from some of the other competitors, ourselves included, it looks like we're stepping up for our fourth quarter of -- a fourth year of 4Q declines. In fact, if you take a look at TI and extract out the wireless revenue, you'll see that our revenues have gone down in the fourth quarter of each of those same years, similar to the industry. And in fact, when you just do the simple math during those last 3 years for the industry, it's down about 4%. So in fact, I don't think that we're suggesting that there's some changed outlook or changed future. In fact, I would offer to you that fourth quarter appears to be shaping up quite normally to us. When we take a look at our third quarter orders, they were actually up about 1% sequentially. Our distribution inventories, as Ron mentioned, were down about a day. And they remain quite lean with our distributors as well as our other customers. Our cancellations remain very low, and we've had no unusual requests for backlog push-outs. So when we put all that together, that suggests to us that the fourth quarter is shaping up to be a normal demand environment, similar to what we've seen for the last -- certainly the last 3 years.","Ron Slaymaker","Vivek, I think the other thing I would just add is even when we talked to you at the mid-quarter update, I -- somebody asked questions about order trends and I remember saying at that point that orders quarter-to-date have been strong. Book-to-bill was above 1, but that we expected that to slow as we approach the end of the quarter basically as we -- for a couple of factors. One, just seasonality in general, both calculators as well as semiconductors. So don't -- was there a slowing through the end of the quarter? Yes. But also, we expected that slowing would occur, and it pretty much happens almost every year and certainly has happened, as Kevin just pointed out, each of the last 3 years. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, Ron, a very helpful clarification. So as my follow-up, I just wanted to make sure. Kevin, did you say that tax rate for Q4 will be 24%; or for the full year, it would be 24%? And then the real question is on dividends and buybacks, I think you mentioned that they have been at 133% of free cash flow over the last year. How long can this stay at those level? And should we just expect them to turn back to whatever, closer to the 100% targets that you have outlined as a longer-term target?","Kevin P. March","Okay, Vivek, the 24% effective tax rate is what you should use for the fourth quarter. With the various things occurring during the year, the entire year will be a little bit different than that. But for planning purposes, use 24% for the fourth quarter. I would remind you that, that tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of this year. And it's unclear whether or not that will be renewed by congress in a timely fashion as we get into 2014. For us, that provides about a 2% benefit to our taxes. So absent that R&D tax credit, we'd be closer to a 26% tax rate as opposed to the 24% that we're suggesting that you use for fourth quarter. As it relates to buybacks, I would just mention that, again, the reason it's been as strong as it has been, the buybacks and dividends at 133% of our free cash flow, is a function of not only improving free cash flow, which we certainly have seen, but also the benefit the company receives when employees exercise their non-qual stock options. And given the increase in the -- in stock prices this past year for our company, we've seen an increase in employee stock option exercises. Just to give you a few numbers and summarize that to kind of recharacterize what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our free cash flow for the last 12 months was $2.87 billion. Proceeds from employee stock options was $1.28 billion. So that means we had sources of cash over the last 12 months of $4.15 billion. We used or returned to shareholders, in the form of dividends and buybacks, $3.82 billion. Then we paid off debt earlier this year of $500 million. So we've used a total of $4.32 billion. So we've virtually used all that we have generated this past year. And we do that because one of the things we mentioned our capital management strategy is that we have a model for how much cash that we carry. And to the extent that we generate cash beyond that model level, we're quite comfortable with returning that to shareholders, as we have been doing. As to the ability of that to continue to run at those high levels, that's a really hard call. I would say that stock options do expire over time, and these are generally 10-year stock option grants that are granted to employees. So quite a few of these options are quite old, and they get used up. So I would expect that as we move into the future, we're apt to see less extra cash coming in from stock option exercises, but I think it's almost impossible to try to forecast the magnitude of that change.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could comment a little bit on Silicon Valley Analog here in terms on where we are in your 3-year plan and if you don't have it available this quarter, would it be possible maybe on the quarter update to talk about what revenue is there, just so we can see where it was relative to where you guys acquired it?","Kevin P. March","Yes. Steve, I would say with the Silicon Valley Analog, first off on the point of revenues, we disclose revenues at the segment level. We don't disclose revenues below that, so we won't be offering the actual revenue figures for SVA. But if I were to talk about where are we at with respect to our expectation for SVA versus when we acquired National Semiconductor, I would say that the overall revenues are probably a little bit lower than we had initially expected at this point in time, given the overall market environment that we've been faced with this past few years. However, the rate of progress on share gain has been quite a bit faster as we've mentioned during the last call, that those product lines are actually gaining share about a year faster than we expected. In addition, we've had more cost synergies than we modeled into the acquisition. We've had lower interest expense on very low cost that we've been able to issue, and we've had substantially -- substantial benefits from taxes as a result of the acquisition. So when you put it all together, the profit that we're achieving on the National Semiconductor portfolio today is very close to what we have modeled at this point in time. And so I'd say we're reasonably satisfied with that bottom line effect.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, Steve, even though we don't break out revenue quarterly, I can give you a kind of a rough breakout for the subsegments of Analog for 2013 year-to-date: so HVAL, 35%; Power, 25%; and then HPA and SVA are each about 20% of total Analog revenue. And again, that's year-to-date. Do you have a follow-on, Steve?","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just if we could follow on in terms of overall acquisition strategy in general. If you look at the microcontroller business, overall, it's still fairly fragmented out there. And also on the Analog side, you guys have talked a lot about gaining share and perhaps accelerating that through acquisition. Is there anything substantial you guys might do on either side there to change your position in any sort of substantial way at this point? Or is it more organic growth from here?","Kevin P. March","Yes. Steve, I think that most of our growth for the foreseeable future is going to be organic. To the extent that we do continue looking at acquisitions, given the valuations that we presently see with many companies out there that might be an attractive addition to our portfolio, it's difficult for us to look at what we might have to pay for some of those acquisitions and actually get a reasonable return on the investment for our shareholders. So that suggests to me that to the extent that we are doing acquisitions, they're probably going to be smaller tuck-in ones that probably come with reasonably good product lines to fill in holes that we have or talented engineers to help with our R&D efforts. They're probably going to be biased towards Analog. One of the problems when you go into the microcontroller side, you start getting different architectures into your family of products and that can add complexity that may not be easily leverageable. That's not to say that we wouldn't look there, but that -- these are the odds that you'd see our microcontroller are tuck-in kind of acquisitions.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Steve, thanks for your questions.","Operator","Next, we'll go to David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Your guidance for EPS and revenue this quarter, does it assume that gross margin will be flat to slightly down with the lower revenues? Or does gross margin keep rising?","Kevin P. March","Yes. David, I think, inherently, with the revenue decline that we're expecting in the fourth quarter, we'll be reducing the loadings in our factories a little bit. So you'd expect underutilization charges will probably increase a bit and have a corresponding impact on gross margins declining a bit in the quarter.","David Wong","Okay, great. And a minor administrative thing, you noted that your cash is largely onshore, so you have no problem returning to shareholders. How do you get your tax rate down to 24%, so far below U.S. tax rate and still generate primarily U.S. cash?","Kevin P. March","Yes. Well, I would -- first, just comment that I don't really our tax rate is all that low. 24% is an awful lot of money to send to the tax collectors. But that aside, tax inherently are pretty complex and there's a lot of things that can affect the tax rates. And especially a company's somewhat unique global footprint. Our footprint on a global basis, including the benefit that we got with the National acquisition, is allowing us to have a relatively effective current tax rate and further enabling us a pretty high repatriation of cash, which, as you know, [indiscernible] of our cash home and we just ended this past quarter with 82% of our cash onshore. But for planning purposes, as we look into the future, we assume that the U.S. tax rate stays about the same incrementally at 35%, and we just model that on a go-forward basis from a repat standpoint. Our objective, again, is to maintain 80% or more of our cash onshore, so that we have it available to use for our shareholders or dividends and stock buybacks.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. David, thanks for your question.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First off, for Kevin, so you have about $4.2 billion in long-term debt, and I think you have about $1 billion in note payable. Can you just remind us what your plans are right now as far as paying back that debt, especially timing?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Tore, we do have a short-term debt of $1 billion, that comes due on May 15 of 2014. We had talked during our capital management strategy discussion back in February that debt, clearly, is going to be a portion or part of our capital structure for quite a long time, especially given that we've got debt that goes out as far as 10 years out. And that, in fact, we will continue including debt in our capital structure or rolling over portions of our debt if the economics made sense. And to us, the definition of the economics making sense is if we can issue new debt at rates that are either below our impression of what the inflation rate will be or below our dividend yield. So with that in mind, I can't forecast exactly what we'll wind up doing when May comes around. But clearly, we'll be prepared to pay off that $1 billion if we need to. But if the economics makes sense, we may very well decide to go ahead and just replace that with new debt.","Ron Slaymaker","A follow-on, Tore?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, a follow-on for you, Ron. I don't know if you'll answer it or not. But can you give any comment on which end markets will do on a relative basis in the December quarter?","Ron Slaymaker","No, but I will give you a consolation and talk about what they did in the third quarter. So in the third quarter, this is not a fourth quarter comment, industrial, as we pointed out, grew and continue to be strong. Automotive grew for us, being driven mainly by infotainment and advanced driver-assist systems, such as blind spot detection, parking assist, a lot of those cool things you see on car commercials these days. And I aspire one day to have a car that actually does that. Computing, notebooks were weak and tablets grew. I heard some competitors talking about weakness in tablets. Don't know where that came from. They were strong for us. Comms infrastructure, the big word was China in third quarter. Operators, in fact, started deployment, released contracts. 2\/3 of those contracts went to China OEMs, 1\/3 to European. I'll note we sell to both. And maybe different products to different players, but we expect to continue to enjoy participation in that China business. Small cell trials are continuing. What I would say is first deployments, we expect to happen probably, call it mid to second half of next year. Handsets, probably the good news there is now, sub-2% of our revenue is legacy wireless, keeps going down. Consumer, good recovery in revenue there after some of the inventory reductions in second quarter. It's probably a game console comment mostly. Digital television continues weak. So again, sorry, I didn't answer the question, but hopefully, there was some value there. Tore, thank you for your question.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Patrick Wang with Evercore.","Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just one question for me. Can you help us understand the underutilization charge in Q3, what you see for utilizations in the fourth quarter, I guess, in terms of that charge? And then also, what you plan to exit the year with in terms of inventory, both on the balance sheet and in the channel?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Patrick. The underutilization charge in the third quarter was about $70 million. That's down from about $100 million in the prior quarter. And as I mentioned, with reductions in our factory loadings expected during the fourth quarter, I'd expect that charge to go up. But I won't give you a forecast with an exact number just yet. That will be a function of exactly what our [indiscernible] will turn out to be by the end of the quarter. As it relates to inventory, our model for inventory is to carry between 105 and 115 days of inventory. We just closed the current quarter to 106 days. So we've got room that we would probably want to take those days up a little bit more. And with the slowdown in demand in fourth quarter, that seems like a -- and a slight opportunity for us to first go ahead and bring those inventory days up a little bit, as we get ready to enter 2014.","Ron Slaymaker","Patrick, I think I understood you say, basically, you got all your questions in there. And to get to more callers, we'll move on to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I apologize, I don't want to put you in the spot, but I'm getting a lot of emails and I'm confused, investors are confused. Going back to the mid-quarter update, I think you did say that long-term seasonality is 8. But then you also said the variability is a lot. So the right way to think about it is a decline up to 4% for the last 4 years, so the last 4-year average. And so, is it that we misinterpreted that in what we're thinking? Not that I was modeling for down 4%, but the Street was clearly higher than me so and hence, they're very close to ask that question. Did we misinterpret your comments or did something change in the quarter?","Ron Slaymaker","I think the key to looking at that, Ambrish -- and all of that is exactly true. If you look at 5-year average, it's down 8. If you look at the last 4 years and take, I think it was fourth quarter '08 out, it's down 4. I think what you hear us talking about here are if you look over the last 3 years. I think in case of the industry and TI, both were -- excuse me, it's something like down 9%. And so I guess the difference is just that -- the only real difference in terms of how we're discussing our own data is I think a meaningful change to say, if you take legacy wireless out. And that was, obviously, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, a very significant part of our revenue mix. Today, it's an insignificant part of the mix. So any impact that has on seasonality going forward, frankly, is -- what it did in the past is irrelevant to our future. So that's really the distinction that we're making at this point. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I did. So just to look forward now, what should -- now that the legacy business will be gone when we go into next year, what should we be thinking about the normal seasonal patterns? And I'm sure you'll answer it, and we'll come back and ask you again for the 4 quarters.","Ron Slaymaker","What the -- the math I've done is, I think if you look at first quarter and you take legacy wireless out and you look at the last 3 years, it's flattish. But what I will encourage you to do, I think we have all of that data out on our website, and that would be a great project for you to work on tonight and publish in your note tomorrow. There'd probably be a lot of value added in that. So again, I'll just -- I'll refer you to that data and let you do the math.","Ambrish, thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'll stick with the theme of a couple callers ago and just stick to one question. There's been a lot of activity in the Analog segment lately relative to the sensors. There's been some M&A activity in some of the Analog peers this year that have grown -- in excess of the market have grown because they've gained some share or had some opportunities in the sensor market. How do you feel about TI's position in that market? Where do you see you guys going there?","Ron Slaymaker","I don't know that -- probably the one thing I would say, Jim, that in that sensing space and, obviously, there are lots of different types of sensors and they're different. But I think at some time in the last month anyway, a few weeks, we did an announcement really of a breakthrough product category in inductive sensing, which is, basically, an entirely new class of data converters, and that truly is innovative. That truly is breakthrough. That being said, when you look at the size of TI in our portfolio of 100,000 products, it can be a breakaway success and it's not going to have a big impact on TI in terms of moving the needle. But I think it's a great example of the kind of innovation that's been taking place at TI over the last decade and why you see just consistent share gains from our company. A lot of people talk about innovation and a lot of times, that spun up in technical terms. We really simplify it and measure it by our -- we producing and innovating and developing products that customers want. And we really let our market share tell the story. That provides the feedback of what is providing innovation that is valued by our customers. So that's one example, a little broader than your sensing question but absolutely a great space and we're right in the middle of it. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","We'll go to Glen Yeung with Citigroup.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ron, when you look at the activity that you're -- cancellations are falling, I think you might not normally expect to see in the context of sum of orders. Are you seeing anything that's unusual, either one way or the other, from your customers?","Ron Slaymaker","No. Cancellations remain at what we would call very low levels by historical standards, and that's part of the reason why we really feel this is a -- we were coming up on a pretty seasonal fourth quarter. We're not seeing anything in the -- on the cancellation front, for example, that would indicate it's anything weaker than normal. I know a lot of people maybe were worried about, well, what's the effect of the government shutdown? Is that showing up in customer demand or anything like that? I'm not sure we have perfect visibly there but we sure didn't see backlog being pushed out by customers. We didn't see a higher rate of cancellations, which we think are both meaningful indicators. Do you have a follow-up, Glen?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. As a follow-up, as I look at the reported gross margin, they're almost around 150 basis points more than what consensus is modeling for next year's gross margins. And I recognize that your movements in revenues and hence utilization will affect that. But as we think about the puts and takes, assuming that next year is even a modest growth year for SEMI conductors, as we think about the puts and takes on gross margins, what could the consensus see right, i.e. gross margins down 150 basis points from current levels, or is, perhaps, consensus seeing things wrong?","Kevin P. March","Yes, well, I guess I would just remind people as they're putting their models together of a couple things. As we look at what's going to drive our gross margins going forward, keep in mind, as we fill these very cost-effective factories that we acquired over the last couple of years, and especially as we fill them with a higher mix of industrial and automotive end market-type products, we're going to see margins continue to be pretty healthy. Another important point to keep in mind is that depreciation today is running about 400 basis points ahead of capital expenditures. So by definition, that means depreciation will start to work itself down over the next couple of years. And that, by itself, will be a boost gross margins. So those are probably the 3 things I would really point to, and that is, again, as we grow and fill up those factories; as we improve our portfolio mix, especially industrial and automotive; and as depreciation declines over the next few years on these lower levels of CapEx, those together should provide nice tailwinds to our gross margins as we go forward.","Ron Slaymaker","So to the scenario that Glen talked about, at 2014, as any kind of reasonable growth or any growth at all, given those tailwinds, it doesn't sound like the Street, if they're modeling down 150 basis points on gross margin, that does not sound consistent with what you just described. Is that right?","Kevin P. March","It sounds inconsistent, but also suggests that you're missing just exactly how much free cash flow we'll generate next year.","Ron Slaymaker","All right. Thank you, Kevin. Okay, and I think, operator, we're going to try to squeeze in one final caller and then we'll wrap it up.","Operator","Okay. Our final question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Kevin, you just talked about some of the puts and takes for gross margin for next year. From the $800 million roughly level you were for kind of core OpEx in the fourth quarter of this year x charges, restructuring, et cetera, what sort of OpEx puts and takes should we think of, heading into 2014?","Kevin P. March","Ross, I think the simplest thing I'd suggest to you is that, clearly, the people who are in R&D and SG&A, the OpEx buckets as we call it, are correctly anticipating that they'll see pay and benefit increases in 2014. So we would certainly see the effect of that. I would probably also remind you that in first quarter, our OpEx typically is seasonally up from fourth quarter. And that's a function of 2 things: one, it's the absence of the holiday periods that we see in the fourth quarter; and the second is the annual pay and benefit increases that begin to take effect in the first quarter and take full effect in the second quarter. So again, I would expect the spend rate as we go into next year begin to increase, coming off a low fourth quarter. Year-over-year, though, given the wind-down of the legacy wireless, probably still year-over-year attractive within our OpEx model in the 20% to 25% range -- probably 20% to 30% range of revenue, excuse me, being at the lower end of that range.","Ron Slaymaker","And Ross, just maybe even shorter term, fourth to first, OpEx typically goes up because of the pay and benefit increase that Kevin described that kicks in, in February but also, just fewer holiday and vacation days taken in first quarter compared with fourth. We see the benefit from those holidays and vacation days. But sequentially, then it tends to work against us in the first quarter. Okay, Ross. Thanks for your questions.","And in general, we're going to stop here. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","And that does conclude today's call.

Riley Financial","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","I\u2019ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continue to strengthen in the industrial market.","In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03. With that backdrop, I\u2019ll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI\u2019s business model.","In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue.","We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned 4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.","From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18% primarily due to growth in power and signal chain each of through about the same amount, high volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.","Now, I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth as most factors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even.","We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets which for the end markets where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.","Operating profit was $1.48 billion, or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.","Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion or $1.03 per share, which included $28 million discrete tax benefit above what we expected.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range.","Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.","In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion.","Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combine returns of dividend and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to our owners.","In the quarter we retired $375million of debt and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issue $600 million in debt in two branches, $300 million each in four year and seven year notes. This leads total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investment, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.","Turning to our outlook for third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.04 to $1.19, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit.","Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31%, compared with our prior expectations of above 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use at the starting point for your longer term model.","Next, we're assuming discrete free tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarter of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate which include discrete tax items translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarter respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models.","I will also remind analyst who are beginning to work with 2018 model that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we\u2019re projecting for the third and fourth quarter of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate the 2018 annual operating tax rate start with 2017 PDP tax of 31% than apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others.","Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long-term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jerald, on behalf of Ross. Just one question from me. You detailed how your end markets change year-on-year. Could you provide some details on how you estimate they change quarter-on-quarter?","Rafael Lizardi","Sure, Jerald. For automotive, basically, it increased sequentially with all sectors growing. Industrial, again, we saw a very broad based growth across the sectors and overall it also increased. Personal electronics increased with most sectors growing. Communications equipment was about even sequentially and enterprise systems are showing also good growth. Do you have a follow-on?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, sure. So you talked in the past about R&D potential is being a little bit elevated in near term now you guys came in further to our model for the quarter. How much longer could R&D be elevated in order to invest in the business?","Dave Pahl","I'll take that first. I would point out that I know you are asking about R&D, but let me address it from on OpEx standpoint. We look at that OpEx as a model and our model is turning to be between 20% and 30% of revenue I mean stable times to be at the lower half of that in fact that's why we've been in the last 2.5 years here so, 23 to 22, now we are running at 22% of revenue and again in stable times we think we can operate there.","Now, inside of that they are both in R&D and actually in SG&A, we have various investments that are strengthening our competitive advantages on the R&D front. We continue to focus on industrial and automotive to broad -- continue broaden portfolio. On the SG&A side, we invested on to increase the reach of our channels ci.com in particular we are thinking that we are going to continue to make those investments to strengthen the Company.","Rafael Lizardi","Okay, great and we will go to our next caller please.","Operator","We will go now to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Gonzalez","Hi, thanks, this is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. First question, maybe could you contrast auto demands now versus say maybe six months ago? Anyhow industrial is an even larger market where you guys even though auto tends to get all your attention. Just wondering, did it correlate at all? Can industrial offset any potential demand fluctuations in autos? Thanks and have follow-up.","Dave Pahl","Sure, yes. So, the strength that we've seen inside of automotive is something that we've seen for probably greater than four years now. So, I'd attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of our technologies and really just the overall diversity of our position. We\u2019ve got five sectors inside of automotive that we are in investing in. So that includes infotainment safety systems, ADAS or advance driver assist systems, power train, which includes EV and hybrid and body electronics and lighting. So we are seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market.","And really also diversity, across sub-system suppliers, across car companies, across geographical regions, so we feel really good about that, very similar story inside of industrial very broad-based growth. I won\u2019t to speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles are not, but both do have increasing content. So, I\u2019d be a little cautious to think that increasing content could offset correction that we may see in a near-term in any one given quarter or even in any one given year. But we believe that there will be more content there over the long-term when you\u2019re looking five and 10 years and that\u2019s why our investments are higher today. Do you have a follow on?","Adam Gonzalez","My second question is more on your free cash flow growth. I\u2019m just curious why if you look at on a trailing 12-month basis, why free cash flow hasn't grown year-on-year despite your core NOI embedded businesses growing into low double-digit range? And what\u2019s the catalyst for maybe getting that back to the higher single-digit maybe low double-digit range? Thanks.","RafaelLizardi","Yes, thanks for -- this is Rafael. Thanks for a chance to clarify that. First, in any given quarter, you're going to have puts and takes on free cash flow -- on in line with the P&L, but particularly on the cash flow -- on the cash flow statement. In this particular quarter and also on a trailing 12-month basis, but what you see there is we had an increased tax payment in 2Q \u201917, that was primarily due to our outlook for higher profitability this year.","Dave Pahl","Okay. And we\u2019ll go through the next caller please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Chris Danely with Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- excuse me with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","I had a question on gross margin. So your revenue is basically back to it was in the third, well I guess little bit higher than it was in the third quarter last year, but the gross margins are 230 basis points higher. Can you just kind of give us the reasons why they are higher? And then what would be the gross margin drivers going forward?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So, our gross margins in second quarter of \u201917 ended at 64.3% and that was 300 basis points higher than in the same quarter last year. And as you reflect the quality of our product portfolio, as we continue to focus on automotive and industrial, but also the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy and as you know, we have the unique advantage of having 300 millimeter factory that at the chip level provides 40% cost advantage. As of 2016, we had about 2.5 billion of our revenue running to 300 millimeter and as we continue to grow the Company, and in this case the Analog in particular, and that growth primarily runs through 300 millimeter then we're going to accrue that benefit over and over and it's a cumulative benefit that really yield some nice results. Through the gross margin line about in more important to their free cash flow and free cash flow for share to for the owner of the Company.","Dave Pahl","Do you have follow-up, Chris?","Chris Danely","Another thing that's going on out there at least some of your competitors have talked about their lead time extending. Is that happening at all at TI?","Rafael Lizardi","Chris, I described our lead times continuing to remain stable, if we do have pocket where we got a processor package, supply tightness, but we\u2019re aggressively working those. But overall our lead times continue to remain stable.","Dave Pahl","Okay thank. We'll go to go the next caller.","Operator","We will go next to William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","It's sort of a follow-up to the last one. We\u2019ve heard quite a bit about shortages for complimentary products SME's in particular on the faster aside. And I'm hoping you find out, if TI is seeing any sort of tapping of its growth opportunities because customers are certainly not going to order, parts if you think they can get a full kit from all their supplier racing that dynamic play at all.","Rafael Lizardi","I would say in general, I'm not sure we could see that if that was there. But I'll just remind you that about 60% of our revenues are on consignment, so we got no inventory of our products sitting in front of the customer's production line that they owned. We may have position that one of our balance sheet and same thing with distributors but we actually do get demand forecast from them and those often times will be several months out, sometime even as far as six months out. And that doesn\u2019t mean that they can't change. And I would say for that where we do have very good visibility and won't see anything unusual going on inside of there, no one usual expedites or cancellations or those types of things. Do you have follow on?","William Stein","Maybe you could comment on order linearity through the quarter and book to bill?","Rafael Lizardi","Sure, so again, I\u2019ll make the comment that we\u2019ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment, so there we actually don\u2019t have orders or backlogs, we only see that those demand forecast. So book to bill is less helpful inside of that but orders if you look at through the month, they were strong overall and they did accelerate as we went through the quarter and into the month of June. Book to bill overall was 1.06. So and with that, we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Solid job on the quarterly execution margin expansion on the outlook, clearly macro dimensions are strong in yearend markets similar to our last quarter. I'm just wondering, if you could just talk about some of the dimensions from a geographic perspective. I think last quarter you guys saw year-over-year growth in of geographies, wondering, if you can just provide us with some details on the June quarter?","Rafael Lizardi","Sure. Harlan. Year-over-year revenue was up in all regions so Asia, Europe and the U.S. and Japan on a year-over-year basis and that was true additionally on a sequential basis. So we saw growth very really across the board there and just as a reminder some of those as well some don\u2019t that the we attract our revenue on where we ship it, so it's not where that product is ultimately keeps in as so we may ship in to a car manufacturer or Tier 1 car manufacturer in Europe and -that's car may end-up and be sold in China as an example. So, it's really is not a good look through for end consumption by market. Do you have a follow-on?","Harlan Sur","Yes, I do. Thanks for the color there. So on embedded strong year-over-year growth in sales. I think your operating profitability was up something like almost 600 basis points year-over-year. Is this mostly leveraged on the OpEx as you drive revenue growth? Or are there some positive mix benefit? And I'm not sure for example if some of your processes solution is going into automotive carry like higher gross margin profile?","Rafael Lizardi","Well, this is Rafael. What I would tell you that the driver the main driver of what you are seeing near is the revenue growth as we have a over a number of years now we've refocused our investments in embedded and now that really being up very nicely. They have embedded has a quite a bit of our investment there is in automotive and industrial just like it is in Analog and then those as we have said those are the best markets and there is that's giving very nice results.","Dave Pahl","Great. Thank you, Harlan, and will go to our next caller please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","I guess two questions from me as well. First off historically that you've always talked about this 30 to 40 basis points of share gained actually on an annual basis. I'm just wondering given the inflection of R&D high over the last several quarters now, should we start to think about share gains potentially accelerating or share gains happening in place where the margin profile is much richer? And when do you see those benefits transfer for you guys on the revenue line?","Dave Pahl","Well, I'll take a shot at that and if Rafael wants to add something, he can jump in. I would just say that as we look and allocate R&D, worth allocating those to the best projects that we can find one so that we are going to produce, it get designed into the most customers into the most market and have longevity of revenue. And really mostly that's about finding better opportunities to invest in and trying to just settle the number of products as an example that we're doing. But we have found more opportunities to make investments its things as our products will live longer and repurpose products into adjacent markets that we found opportunities to be able to do that.","So and I think just in general the quality of the opportunity share doesn\u2019t shift very quickly. And so we are not penciling in an inflection point inside of our revenue. But when you look at our competitive advantages and -- I just say, just as a reminder, all four those together and the investments that we are making, and that includes the manufacturing and technology, the most visible one there is the 300 millimeter advantage that we have. The broader portfolio and just the tens of thousands of products that we\u2019ve got the opportunity to sell more products to customers the reach of the channel market including ti.com that Rafael had mentioned earlier as well as our sales force. And then just the diverse in line with positions, all those working together, I think this is confidence that in the -- in the future that we can continue to gain share in that range 30, 40 basis points.","Rafael Lizardi","The only thing, I would add is, as you know we talk about it quite a bit we\u2019ve been focusing on our industrial for quite some time now because they\u2019ll start advance, there\u2019s kind of benchmark that they have the highest semiconductor content growth. And we are confident that will continue to have that for -- for many years to come. So as of the end of last year 51% of our \u2013 of our revenue was automotive and industrial and obviously with the growth we are seeing year-to-date that number appears to be picking up that percentage. So that numbers increases and we continue drive in a performance on those two segments. Then mathematically overall revenue will do better.","Dave Pahl","Amit, do you have follow-on?","Amit Daryanani","I do and hopefully I don\u2019t jinx the strength right now. But last four quarters I think all you guys have been pretty much at the high end of our revenue guide that you guys initially provide. Is there a change in the way you provide guide? Or you rolled up the revenue forecast that things have actually ended up at the high for four quarters in a row? Or is it just happened to be the case?","Rafael Lizardi","It\u2019s really the later, when we look at the out quarter, again we\u2019ve got 60% of the revenues that we don\u2019t have patterns to look at, but we can actually seeing the demand patterns that that our customers have. And that can move in both directions pretty quickly, right. So even though we got great visibility there, things can strengthen or we can very quickly on us. But we do have very, very good visibility for that 50% of our revenue. And rest of that we look at, we do look at the backlog, we look at order patterns and our sales teams provide forecast as well. So, we go through our bottoms up and tops down approach. So, the revenue guidance that we gave for the third quarter is our best estimate of what we think we\u2019ll do. Okay.","Dave Pahl","Okay, thank you, Amit. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Rafael, I apologize if I missed this. But, what I think just talk a little bit about OpEx trends going into the September quarter, typically, it\u2019s a seasonally down quarter for OpEx. I\u2019m just kind of curious, is that how we should be thinking about modeling it this September? Or are there some incentive or variable bonus offset that might actually have OpEx flat or up sequentially?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, I\u2019ll be happy to add some clarity on that. As you know, we don\u2019t guide specifically on OpEx or GPM, any line for that matter, matter other than revenue and EPS. But on OpEx -- and I should say, on OpEx we focus on the model, the 20% to 30%. And we\u2019ve been operating in the lower half of that. So we like, you guys to think a lot that way. I would tell you though if we had anything unusual going on an OpEx, we would point that out second to third and we do not. And we also don\u2019t have anything like vacation or compensation adjustment that sometimes or we do see fourth to first for example. We do not have that going on in a second to third concession.","Dave Pahl","Just add to that when you look at our history we had some restructuring in the last few third quarters that you may have seen that transition that Rafael stated. There is not a seasonal impact you see inside the third quarter typically. Do you have a follow-on, John?","John Pitzer","Dave, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the auto market because clearly over the last several year, it's been one of the better semis, but there have been some sort of mix data points, starts decelerating, you've seen some auto manufactures actually coming forecast in the back half of the year. So I guess how do you think about kind of solid unit growth versus content growth? And how is the visibility there? And are you seeing things that others might have highlighted last week on their conference call?","Dave Pahl","Yes, so the one thing that been clear, our business has grown a very strong for four years plus now, so and that\u2019s really due to the early investments that we had made inside of this market, we continue to make. And again we're trying to ensure that we're making those investments as broad as we can, so we're not ending on one particular technology or one type of portion of that demand that\u2019s increasing.","And clearly I don\u2019t think it's well know that actually content has grown faster inside auto's and if you go down into a showroom you can see that pretty clearly in any car today versus even just a few years ago. So we\u2019re confident that that trend will continue and we've also seen the announcements, like you've mentioned that some car companies have reduced their bill plan, we certainly continue to monitor those markets overall but we're confident in our long-term position there and we will continue to make those investments. Okay thank you John and we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We will now to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Sorry about that straddling two calls and I apologize if this has been answered already. In the reported quarter, did the upside comp versus your expectations going into the quarter?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, Ambrish, it was -- things were pretty strong, really across the board. So, we saw growth really in most market, most geographies and even lot of the sub sectors inside of automotive and industrial.","Dave Pahl","And with that, three quarters of our growth came from industrial and automotive. So that just shows you how strong those were.","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes, I did Dave, and this is you're kind enough always when we have this topic comes up every couple of quarters and not surprisingly we're in an economic expansion for a while now, top of the cycle. You have metrics that you look out with your cancellations, booking and so you share them quite frequently with us. So where are we, where is TI's on those metrics Dave. Thank you.","Dave Pahl","I would say that if you look again inside of distribution, our inventory there remains at about four weeks is actually down sequentially and down from a year-ago. Our visibility in the customers inventory is of course very depending on if for on consignment or not so with our consigned OEMs were not thinking things that's unusual there such as expedite that would suggest that we have an issue, and off course our visibility and the inventory beyond with customers manufacturing operations is very little overall, so again cancellations remained low lead times continues to remain steady. So all of those metrics I think really our very similar to what we saw 90-days ago. So I think you Ambrish and I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","We will go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financials.","Craig Ellis","I wanted to come back on the gross margin point so congratulations on getting to 64% in the quarter. When I look at the incremental for the quarter, it was 79%, which is above the 68% to 69% level but that it had been for the last five or six quarters, not unprecedented but look like a step-up. Is that something we should interpret as being more sustainable? Or were there some either mix items or other lumpy 300 million transition items that contributed to be atypical surge in the quarter?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, this is Rafael. Well, we would tell you any given quarter the follow through will be a little different. In our company the size of ours are there is just a lot of puts and takes inside this big P&L the more important thing to remember is that we have some fundamental structural drivers that are have increased our GPM percent and we think we are in a continue increasing our GPM percent for a forcible future. And those are the quality of their portfolio as we continue to focus on the best market that are more even an industrial and the diversity and possessions and long live possessions that we get with those where we invest our R&D today and we get the revenue for decades to come. And then the other piece is 300 millimeter Analog as stated earlier that is 40% more cost efficient than 200 millimeter. And that accurse me and you starting one part on that and then in the next part you started on 300 and the third part and the fourth part and you making it all a bigger percent in terms of your company's is running on 300 millimeter and it was only the 30% as of 2016 and the 30% of the capacity we have on 300 which used. So we have ample room to continue growing 300 millimeter and accrue benefits to the Company.","Dave Pahl","Do you have a follow on?","Craig Ellis","Yes, thank you. Just regarding the end market color you provided in response to earlier question Dave. Comps are going to be flattish quarter-on-quarter. Can you just what pressure maybe in terms of where that the Company stands with respect to how it's looking at comps from a strategic standpoint and where you see demand is as we look around and look at 4G infrastructure investments being made globally? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Sure. Yes, so comps equipment is 13% of our total revenue the viral or debt infrastructure will be sector inside of that which tends to take a lot of the calls it's more than half of that end market owned by itself so pricing more in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue. And you know there I think when we look at incremental dollars of where we are investing. And if I refer you back to our capital management call that we get stay back in February, we talked about the fact that we wanted to increase incrementally dollars in both the industrial and automotive market because that\u2019s where we believe the growth will be.","With communications equipment, I would say that we got some caveats depending on which business we are looking at. In Embedded, I would say that those investments are down versus where say where maybe five years ago. But on the same view inside of Analog, they're actually up because the some of the complexity that, that\u2019s being developed inside of the radio.","So, we do believe that that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of time. But we just don\u2019t believe that there is going to be significant growth, we don\u2019t know if any carriers that want to take up the CapEx over the next 5 and 10 years, over a long period of time. So, thank you for that question, Greg and thank you all for joining us tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20455":["Texas Instruments Inc.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. In addition, Dave Pahl has joined us.","As many of you know, I will retire in August and Dave will replace me as Head of Investor Relations. Dave has worked at TI for 25 years and has worked directly with me Investor Relations for 10 years. With that consideration, you probably should allow him some time to come up to speed.","Dave has also been recently elected by TI's Board to the position of Company Vice President. Dave will moderate today's call. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thank you, Ron. It's good to join you today for the call. And now down to business.","For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and any relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at TI.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and could be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for more complete description.","The second quarter was another solid quarter. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew strongly with combined revenue up 14% from a year ago. We continue to benefit from our investments in industrial and automotive as these important markets continue to grow as a percentage of our revenue.","Revenue of $3.29 billion came in slightly higher than the middle of the expected range we communicated to you in April. Earnings per share of $0.62 were near the top of our expected range as profitability was stronger in the quarter. Free cash flow of $3.2 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period was right in line with the 20% to 30% range in which we expect to operate over time.","Also over the past 12 months we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. As a reminder, our model for cash returns to shareholders is to return all of our free cash flow less the net debt amount that is retired, plus any proceeds we received from exercises of equity compensation. This model demonstrates our confidence in TI'x business and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","In the second quarter TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by power management. High-performance analog, high-volume analog and logic and Silicon Valley analog also grew.","Embedded processing revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily due to processors and micro-controllers, both of which grew about the same amount. Connectivity grew at a faster rate, although it was coming from a much smaller base. Embedded processing delivered its seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year growth as our investments over the past few years in strategic areas are yielding favorable results.","In our other segment, revenue declined $90 million or 13% from a year ago due to legacy wireless which is essentially gone.","Turning to distribution, resales increased 15% from a year ago while distributors' inventories were about even. Weeks of inventories fell by several days to just over 4-1\/2 weeks. This reduction was driven by a higher percentage of resales being supported by TI's consignment inventory programs.","From an end-market perspective, most growth from the year-ago came in communications equipment, followed by automotive and industrial. Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that use legacy wireless products from TI.","Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Kevin March","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone.","Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 57.1% of revenue. Gross profit increased 20% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin hit another new record. When compared with the previous record in the third quarter of 2013, revenue was $48 million higher and gross profit was $102 million. This reflects an improved product portfolio focus on analog and embedded processing, as well as increased efficiency in our manufacturing operations.","Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $821 million was down $39 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the reductions in legacy wireless as well as continued cost discipline across TI. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $4 million benefit. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter included a gain of $315 million associated with the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer.","Operating profit was $982 million or 29.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter.","Net income in the second quarter was $683 million or $0.62 per share.","Let me comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations were $775 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, consistent with our model of 105 million to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $80 million in the quarter.","On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.59 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $388 million or 3% of revenue, even lower than our long-term expectation of 4%. Although we've been able to keep capital expenditures at this low level, we continue to invest to expand both our capabilities and our capacity.","As examples, capital expenditures in the second quarter included the cost to prepare the site and install the first tools into our new assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China. We completed manufacturing our first units there for qualification purposes. In addition, we brought on additional tools to expand capacity in our 300 millimeter facility in Richardson, Texas. We were able to make these investments and keep our capital spending at low levels because of our strategy to invest in capacity opportunistically and ahead of demand.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.20 billion or 25% of revenue, in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. Free cash flow was 10% higher than a year ago.","Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $856 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $468 million or 3.7% of revenue. We continue to expect the whole capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. As a result, the depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margins will directly benefit.","As we said, we believe strong cash flow growth, particularly free cash flow growth, is most important to maximize shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. To that end, in the second quarter, TI paid $323 million in dividends and repurchased $743 million of our stock for a total return of $1.07 billion.","The shareholder return part of our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow minus debt retirement plus any proceeds that we receive from exercises of equity compensation. Total cash return in the past 12 months was $4.2 billion, which was 18% higher than a year ago. Dividends were up 32% and stock repurchases were up 13%. Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices.","We ended the second quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, down from $4.03 billion at the beginning of the quarter. The decline mostly reflects the use of $1 billion to retire debt in the quarter. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.","TI orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 7% from a year ago, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.01, which would have been higher but was impacted by the conversion of consignment of some products that are sold through distribution.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 6% from the year ago. If you exclude the $57 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year-ago quarter, revenue would increase 8%.","We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.76. Restructuring charges will continue to be essentially nil. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at this level for the next five years.","Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter.","In summary, the second quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model, focused on analog and embedded processing which we believe are the best opportunities inside of the semiconductor market. We continue to invest in areas that offer sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The percentage of our business from industrial and automotive markets continues to grow as customers increasingly embrace technology that makes end-products smarter and more connected. At the same time, we continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities, and our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets means that we can deliver strong free cash flows. We continue to demonstrate, as we did again in the second quarter, our commitment to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions --","Operator","Thank you.","Dave Pahl","-- in order to provide as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Go ahead, Renee [ph].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And we'll now take the first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Kevin, I guess my first question is on OpEx. I think for the June quarter, going into June, you kind of guided OpEx would be flattish Q-on-Q, and you did better than that. I'm kind of curious, is that a pull-in of the $130 million of annualized savings you expected from the restructuring or is that just a bigger number than 130? And how do we think about OpEx trending in September, in the back half of the year?","Kevin March","Yeah, John, you're right, the OpEx we had expected to be roughly even from first quarter and the second quarter, and that came in a bit lower than we had expected. And part of that was some pull-in with the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter for both embedded processing and resizing of our operation in Japan, and part of it was just continued discipline on the part of all the business units in TI when it came to spending.","As you look into 3Q, we continue to expect the second half to be the primary benefit of the cost savings that we talked about for those restructuring action. Recall [ph] that we expect about $130 million of annualized savings, with about 85% of that in OpEx and the balance in cost of revenue. So as we go into third quarter, we'll see probably about half of that amount come in to our results in OpEx, with the balance in fourth quarter. So by the time we leave the year, we should be at an annualized $130 million cost savings from that action.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-up, John?","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, that's helpful, Kevin. As a follow-up, I know this is somewhat of an unfair question, but if you look at the proceeds from equity compensation. Last year it was almost about a third of the cash returns to investors. I know that's been a volatile number and probably a number that's impossible to predict. But I'm kind of curious, how should you think we should think about that number going forward from here? How do we try to model that number in the future?","Kevin March","John, we talked in -- during the update to our capital management strategy that going forward we would expect the proceeds from stock option exercises to reduce considerably. We saw, gosh, I think it was probably two to three times our normal rate stock option exercises and cash proceeds, in 2013 than we'd seen in prior years. So we'd talked about that going forward that would probably come back down to a more normalized level. And I would suspect that, you know, what we saw last quarter, what we saw this quarter, probably is more reflective of what you should model going forward, figure about, you know, I think we saw about 4% or 5% of stock options exercised last year, and that'll probably drop back down to 1.5%, 2% kind of level.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, John. Next caller please?","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. You know, could you just give us some perspective on kind of the broader cyclical environment? Would you say there's anything at all going on other than normal, and maybe break that down by sub-category a little bit? And I'll leave that as both questions and pass from there. Thanks.","Dave Pahl","Okay, Jim. I think that, you know, we don't have any unique insight into what's going on from a cyclical standpoint. I think that the quarter that we just delivered, you know, we feel good about. If you look at the middle of our range into third quarter, 8% if you're excluding legacy wireless, is another good quarter on a year-on-year basis.","If you look at a lot of the signals that one would pay attention to, such as inventory inside of the channel, we took several days out of inventory in the quarter as we had a higher percentage of revenue supported by our consignment programs inside of distribution. And if you look at cancellations, they continue to remain at very, very low levels. We think inventory at customers remains in check as well.","So -- and then if you look at our lead times, they continue to remain stable. We'll always have some pockets where they may move out temporarily. But with our capacity and the position of our inventory, we feel really good to be able to continue to support that.","So you have a follow-up question?","Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs","The sub, the verticals, any differences by vertical?","Dave Pahl","No. I think that from a year-on-year standpoint we had, if you look at industrial, we had growth in nearly all the sectors, so, very broad-based from that standpoint, led by areas like factory automation. Automotive we had double-digit growth, and all of our sectors led by ADAS or Advanced Driver Systems. Personal electronics was down, but it would have been up had it not been for legacy wireless. Our enterprise systems we saw growth, driven by projectors and servers. And coms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure. So, really broad-based growth on that stand.","Okay, thanks. We'll go to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to dig in to your, I guess, your margin trajectory. Your incremental operating margins for analog and embedded processing both exceeded 100% sequentially in the quarter. Your analog business also has about 100% incremental operating margins year over year. I guess the strong performance, particularly in analog, surprises me a little bit. I thought most of the cut you did were in embedded processing. So I wonder if you could give us some sort of view on what's driving that strong incremental margin, how much of that is sort of gross margin expansion within the businesses versus OpEx. And what do you sort of see as sort of sustainable levels of incremental operating margin going forward as the revenues in the businesses continue to grow?","Kevin March","Yes, Stacy, the fall-through was very good both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, certainly at the company level and at the segment levels. The -- I'd mentioned I guess on the first call from John that, from an OpEx standpoint, spending remains disciplined across the company. So while the restructuring action that you referred to will disproportionately benefit embedded processing versus other areas of the company, some of that will also -- some of that restructuring will benefit other areas of the company as well.","For example, we mentioned resizing our sales team in Japan. And that, not just the sales team in support of embedded processing but also those in support of some of the other business units. So you get a little bit of benefit there. But then really you got just disciplined spending across the company, as frankly people are spending only what they need to support the growth of the business.","On a go-forward basis, again we expect OpEx to be down a little bit sequentially, primarily for the benefit of embedded processing. That'll be true for both the third and fourth quarter. Beyond that, I don't know if that gives you any more specific forecast on OpEx other than, by the time we reach the end of the year, we will enter next year with OpEx about, total cost savings from the restructuring, about $130 million, about 85% of that coming off OpEx.","Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Got it. That's helpful.","Yeah. For my follow-on, I want to dig in to gross margin just a little bit. So if I take that, you know, half of the $130 million kind of hitting you or 85% hitting you by next quarter, it sounds to me like you're guiding OpEx down about 2%, which would give me an implied gross margin guidance at the corporate level, call it into the upper 57%, so, you know, up maybe 500 basis points, maybe a little more, off from Q2. So can you give us just some view of what's driving that gross margin expansion? Is this just further efficiencies, manufacturing efficiencies, is this just depreciation coming down? Is this something also to do with mix or pricing, or just overall revenue leverage as revenues grow?","Kevin March","You know, I think it's a little bit of all of that, to be quite frank, Stacy. The -- if you take a look at, as we go forward on gross margin, you know, there's multiple drivers inside the portfolio, not the least of which is being able to load or fill up our very cost-effective factories. We also get improved product mix, especially as we see industrial and automotive becoming a larger portion of our total revenue mix. And finally, we get the benefit from depreciation as it begins to roll off, being that the CapEx is running substantially below depreciation now for quite some time. Again just to remind, the depreciation was about 7% of revenue over the last 12 months and CapEx is expected to around 4%. So, you know, we get some closure that will start happening over the next couple of years. Depreciation this year is expected to be down a bit versus last year, but it'll start to climb more rapidly next year.","So you got a number of different things going on, not just next quarter, that will move gross margins up again, as you indicated, but should also continue to benefit us as we look out into the balance of the year and going into 2015.","Dave Pahl","Great. Thank you, Stacy. Operator, we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We'll go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays next.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wondering what utilization was in the quarter and where you expect that to go. And then the second part of my question, as you look into December, typically seasonally softer period, things seem fairly normal. I was wondering your thoughts on just seasonality into December.","Kevin March","I'll mention -- I'll talk to utilization and Dave will talk to seasonality there. But, you know, Blayne, we look at utilization 2Q to 3Q, we don't expect that to really change all that much, as we, you know, have our wafer starts not too far off from what we saw in the first quarter and what we -- excuse me, the second quarter, and what we saw in the second quarter will come out of the factory in the third quarter. So overall utilization, unlikely to change all that much as we look into the near term.","Dave Pahl","And from a seasonality standpoint, Blayne, essentially we're going to let you determine what you believe seasonality is. And just a few things to consider as you go through that, obviously calculator revenue is usually strongest in second quarter and third quarter with the back-to-school buying period, and you saw that in our results this quarter. And our semiconductor growth is typically relatively stronger in the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth.","So, outside of that, we don't put much credence on a specific sequential growth number just because the numbers around that have been so unpredictable, and we're just going to step back from trying to provide any appearance of doing that on it, because it'll appear that we're endorsing one number over another, so.","You have a follow-on, Blayne?","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays","Just wondering, maybe in the September quarter, a similar question, whether outside of calculators there's any areas of particular strength or weakness. You had mentioned com had been a strong point. Is that sustaining? And then it seems like autos as well have held in there better, usually seasonally weaker second half, but seems strong. Any comments there?","Dave Pahl","Sure, yeah. Other than the top-line [[ph] guidance, we don't really get into strength or weakness by sector. If there's something very unusual going on, like with our legacy wireless, of course we've given visibility into those types of things in the past.","So with that, we'll move to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move to Doug Friedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And before I begin my question, Ron, it's been great working with you, and best of luck in retirement, before forgetting to say that.","So going into the numbers, if you could talk a little bit maybe about your strategy to maybe increase free cash flow. When we look at sort of what's going on with your balance sheet, you're getting pretty close to getting a debt level that might be good to carry that debt and stop retiring it or maybe just start rolling it forward. Can you maybe talk a little bit, Kevin, about your strategy there?","Kevin March","Well, the strategy is less about debt and more about the actual product portfolio and the markets we're going after, Doug. It's really about being sure that we're thoughtful on how we spend our research and development dollars, and we spend them on products that we expect to have very long revenue life streams off of them.","And then in correlation with that is to continue to be opportunistic and to expand our manufacturing capacity at times when you may least expect us to do that, because we can get it for costs that are very low. Those are our two biggest levers for expanding cash flow.","As it relates to debt going forward, as you observed, we just paid off in debt of $500 million this year. We raised $500 million in the first quarter and repaid $1 billion in the second quarter, so a net reduction of $500 million.","We still have on the balance sheet total debt of about $4.625 billion, and those actually have lives that extend all the way out to 2023. So I don't see balance vanishing from -- debt vanishing from our balance sheet anytime soon.","On a go-forward basis, of course our buyback, I think that was one of the things you were asking about on the free cash flow, is really a function of what our calculation of net present value of the company is. And so long as we see that the intrinsic value of the company exceeds the market value, we'll continue to be buyers of the stock.","Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And --","Dave Pahl","Doug, you have a follow-up?","Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. What role will M&A possibly play, and when do you think is there an opportunity to reenter the M&A markets? You guys really have not been active since the National Semi deal has closed.","Kevin March","You know, when it comes to M&A, again it's about product strategy. Our bias is likely to be to find an opportunity that would be attractive to us. Our bias would probably be in the analog space as opposed to embedded processing. And frankly, aside from the technology that we acquire and the product opportunity that we acquire, being attractive, meaning long revenue streams, it would also have to work for us mathematically, meaning that the price at which we could acquire it would have to be such that we could get a return on our invested capital inside of three to four-year period. And we're pretty disciplined about that.","Some of the opportunities that some have speculated on here in recent months are such, if we do the math, it's very difficult to overcome that hurdle of making sure its ROIs be accretive. And we think that's very important if we're going to actually generate excess cash flow and free cash flow off of any acquisition in the future.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Doug. Operator, next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk around the strengths that you alluded to in communications equipment in Q2. Is that macro base stations or is there some other element of that?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. The majority of that is -- would be macro base stations. If you look at investments that we're making longer term, that will include small cell, but we really don't have measurable revenue on products like that at this point.","Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And as part of the embedded restructuring that you had done, it sounded you were pulling back on some of the investing in that category. Does that your trajectory at all or does that mean you'll participate less in base stations over time?","Dave Pahl","No. I think if you look at those investments and those product cycles, they tend to have -- they tend to be very long in nature. So the areas that we've pulled back tend to be areas that we now believe are either mature or in the process of maturing, and yet we continue to invest in areas that will drive growth in the future as much as small cells, as I indicated before, so.","Thank you, Joe. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you. A question on CapEx, Kevin. Your capital intensity has been fairly below the 4% that you had said that you would be. What should we be modeling for the remainder of the year? And more importantly, what would cause it to move and check [ph] upwards?","Kevin March","Yeah, Ambrish, you know, again I think for purposes of your models, I would just assume about a 4% of revenue kind of planning. It's going to get you pretty close to probably the right answer over time. In any one quarter I'm sure it's going to be off, but it will be okay for -- on a rough annual period.","Anything that might cause us to go above that could possibly be if we had a sudden opportunity present itself, we could add capacity at a significant cost savings. We wouldn't let than 4% artificially restrain us from taking advantage of very inexpensive manufacturing capacity which would benefit our future free cash flow. But right now I don't see that on the horizon, so again for your model I'd probably just use 4%.","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And my quick follow-up, Dave, you mentioned that consignment as a percent of sales has changed. What has it gone back up? And I think I remember it used to be in the mid-40s before?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. If you look overall, our consignment as a percent of revenue has moved up a little bit from about 45% to about 50%. If you look inside of our distribution channel, so about 55% of our revenues are -- go through distribution and about 55% of those revenues are supported by consignment. So that's really the part that's beginning to drive that higher and our inventories that's owned by distributors lower.","So, thanks, Ambrish, and we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets.","Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Hey guys. So your extra capacity, you know, at the bottom of the cycle may have been a bit of a burden but can be very valuable as the cycle heats up here. So do you think we're at the point in the cycle where you guys are benefiting from that extra capacity either front-end or backend? Do you think that some of your competitors might have a lack of capacity there, might be switching to your products?","Kevin March","Christopher, clearly we've had this strategy in place now for a number of years where we're acquiring as inexpensively as we can manage to in advance of our needs. The most recent example was the acquisition of an assembly test operation in Chengdu, China that I commented on in the call that we're now bringing online. And so that has certainly been a benefit to us, to allow us to have very stable lead times on behalf of our customers, and to be able to meet any short-term spikes or inside lead time requests that customers had had.","You know, broadly speaking, across the industry, it does break [ph] us that many people perhaps have chosen not to invest in as much capacity as they might have in the past. It's unclear to us just what that may mean going forward. But at least from our standpoint for our customers, they can have confidence that we have ample capacity to meet their need.","Dave Pahl","Yeah, and Chris, I'll add also, you know, we've taken other actions that utilize that capacity different points of demand. And so one thing that we've done, and you can see it on the balance sheet, is that in periods of weaker demand we'll actually build finished good inventory as well as aging wafers to support future demand on low-volume products.","And so it may take 20 minutes, 30 minutes to set up a piece of assembly test equipment, and you may run only 10,000 units on that part, and it may take up a half-hour or an hour. It doesn't take much longer to build either, you know, six months of demand or a full year of demand or a year-and-a-half of demand, and put that on the shelves. So when demand actually gets stronger, we've got the capacity open and available to support that stronger demand. So we feel good to be able to support really any demand environment that we see in the future.","You have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Sure. The other segment, it was above the Street, also above seasonality. Is that just calculators or is there something else there?","Kevin March","Yeah, that's really just calculators, just seasonally strong in the second and third quarter for the back-to-school selling season, and then is typically weaker in the fourth and first quarter as kids are already in school and have their calculators.","Dave Pahl","Thank you, Chris. Now we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take the next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks for taking my question. And good luck to both Dave and to Ron.","For my first question, I'm curious, what are under-utilization charges running at right now? And at what level of utilization can they go to zero?","Kevin March","Yeah, Vivek, they were about $56 million last quarter, down from the prior quarter which was about $105 million.","And that's a bit of a theoretical question as to, you know, what revenue it would take to get to zero. Clearly the mix of products flowing across the various manufacturing flows are going to have a direct bearing on that. So if we had much higher demand but it was on a flow where we didn't have a lot of excess capacity, it wouldn't help much on the under-utilization. So our job on that is to make sure that all of our flows maintain open capacity.","And I'll remind everybody again that the under-utilization, we don't let that distract us. It's an accounting adjustment that affects -- nothing happens to free cash flow. We are completely focused on free cash flow as the way to return value to our shareholders.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. And Vivek, I'll also mention that that charge is -- less than half of it is actual cash, so -- or about half of it is non-cash. So, really doesn't impact our free cash flow by having that open capacity.","Do you have a follow-up?","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah. So I guess that means open capacity you have is more source of keeping CapEx low and free cash flow rather than being a big source of expanding gross margins.","But maybe on to my second question, on the demand environment, can you give us a sense, I think you mentioned end-markets, but what about the geographies, are there certain geos that are better or worse than what you thought two months ago? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Okay. So let me follow up on the last one, just to make a clarifying point.","So as Kevin talked about, there are certain factories that, you know, and you've seen some competitors, some of the manufacturers in Taiwan run above 100% capacity. So, you know, when we've got factories or flows that run above 100% or above the theoretical level that we've got from utilization standpoint, we'll continue to get a benefit, and we still may have an under-utilization charge. So, don't think that that -- all you have left is revenue growth, that small number that's an under-utilization charge. So, just wanted to make that clear.","So from a regional standpoint, year over year, Vivek, we saw Asia, Europe and Japan were up. The U.S. was -- it was roughly even from a year-ago standpoint.","So with that, we'll get to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from CJ Muse with ISI Group.","CJ Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, once OpEx normalizes in calendar '2014, how should we think about growth in OpEx relative to top line into 2015 and beyond?","Kevin March","Well, CJ, that's a long way planning you're doing there for a semiconductor analyst. You know, from an OpEx standpoint, I think that it will probably grow at least with the change in paying benefits that you'd expect on a year-over-year basis, so you'd certainly start there. And then to the extent that we see additional opportunities that we may want to invest in from an R&D standpoint or additional sales opportunities we may want to expand, it may go a bit beyond that.","But typically you're going to see -- I think last year, paying benefits increased, average, around 3%, maybe 4%, depending upon the average from around the world. So that's what I'd probably use for planning.","CJ Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, question on the cycle. It looks like your guide for Q3 year over year is slowing a bit, and would love to hear your thoughts on where we are here. Will we -- rebuilding inventory downstream and now we're normalizing and now attracting more with GDP and\/or, you know, are there any signs of re-acceleration in GDP or in demand in any point geographically or product life, et cetera?","Dave Pahl","Yes. CJ, I think, you know, on that front, we really don't spend a lot of time looking at the cycle, and our strongest indicator demand of course is the view that we get from orders and the forecast that we get from our consignment customers as they'll give us forecast. This forecast of course can change.","And, you know, we just turned in a good growth year on year. If you look at the year-on-year growth, that's 6%, 8% without legacy wireless, continues to be -- continues to be strong, at the midpoint of the guidance range, yes. And so, you know, that's what -- that we believe all those indicators are showing us.","As I talked about before, things like, you know, we're building demand in the channel or downstream, it actually took inventory out of the channel as more of our distributors moved to consignment, and as the products that were on consignment actually grew faster than the other products. So we really, you know, for a little over four-and-a-half weeks of inventory that's in the channel, we consider that to be lean, but probably will be running in what is the more of a new normal range.","So those changes in inventory downstream because of the consignments that we've got are going to have less of an impact on our revenues as what they've had in the past.","So with that, we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move to David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you very much. Could you give us some idea of how your policy of returning the bulk of your cash to shareholders affects future acquisition policy? Do you have expectation, your acquisition activity will be relatively low or that you'll be working primarily in stock purchases?","Kevin March","Yeah. David, I think the way to think about it, it relates - it kind of goes back a bit to a question that was asked earlier about, I believe by Doug, on debt on the balance sheet, from an acquisition standpoint, again, we'll look at first the strategic bit, make sure it makes sense, and then second, to make sure the numbers actually work on the return on the invested capital that we put into it.","Beyond that, the way we'd pay for it is probably very similar to what we did this last time, when we bought National Semiconductor, we used some cash on hand but we actually released the strength of the balance sheet and went out to the bond market and issued quite a bit of debt which supported that acquisition.","As we slowly retire debt as we had been and continue to over the next foreseeable future, that just opens the balance sheet back up and makes it available again to take on debt if there's an attractive ROIC accretive acquisition out there. So that's where I would -- that's how I would think about the strategy going forward. I don't see any of our cash management strategy having any interference whatsoever with our ability to continue to acquire when it makes sense.","David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from William Stein with Suntrust.","William Stein \u2013 Suntrust Humphrey Robinson","Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the good quarter and guide.","I'm hoping you might comment on the margin progression in the embedded segment. It seems to -- progressed a bit better and it looks to us as though perhaps the restructuring benefits that you're targeting are coming in a bit earlier than you previously expected.","Kevin March","Yeah. You're exactly right on that. They have started to come in a bit earlier than we planned, but we still have a long way to go. We will see additional benefit as we move in the second and third quarter, as we talked about -- excuse me, third and fourth quarters as we talked about earlier, as we see more of the costs begin to come out of there. But frankly while that's certainly helpful in moving the profit performance of that segment forward, it is not going to be done when that's over with. There's a lot more work to be done there, and work is really on the revenue growth side.","The operating profit clearly is below what we think the potential for that segment is, and that management team is very focused on driving results to get that profit up to where it should be. And really after the restructuring actions are complete by the end of this year, it's really going to be all about revenue growth. It actually has been a lot about revenue growth as evidenced by the fact that that business has successfully grown for seven quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis, and we expect to see more of that as we go forward. So that business can grow its way into cost structure [indiscernible] --","William Stein \u2013 Suntrust Humphrey Robinson","That's helpful. If I can follow up just a bit in that. I think there's one area of that business where you're kind of under-hitting relative to your weight in the industry, and that's micro-controllers. I know that you've invested in this area in the last year or two. I'm wondering if you can talk about, you know, the strategy in terms of products, end-markets, features that might lead to accelerating share gain in that category.","Dave Pahl","Yeah, maybe I'll make a comment, and if you'd like to add in, Kevin.","Yeah. Well, as you know, that's an area that we decided to step up investments going back several years ago now, back 2010, 2011, in that period. And the expansion of investments included both development teams to produce more products and begin to broaden the portfolio. And second is in application support, basically supporting customers and design-ins. So we feel really good about the progress that we've got. We have several years that we have gained share inside of micro-controllers.","I think that we still -- I think some industry analysts will have us at like a number six position inside of the market. So we've got plenty of room to go. And those are the types of markets that take a while to begin to get traction, and somewhat like a flywheel that you keep investing, keep making progress, and that progress begins to snowball.","From a product standpoint, we're really building out a broad portfolio. We're focused on catalog products, primarily going into industrial applications. You'll note inside of embedded processing we also have connectivity products. So there we support about a dozen different wireless standards. So we're getting very good traction and you can go to our website today and be able to find reference designs with micro-controllers ranging from $0.25 up to a couple of dollars using all of those different combinations of the connectivity products.","So we feel really good about the progress. As I said in the opening remarks, embedded processing has had seven quarters of year-on-year growth, and a big part of that is driven from micro-controllers.","Okay, thank you very much, Will. We can go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi guys. Before my questions, also want to just pass on the congrats to Ron and to Dave on the promotion. Best of luck to both of you.","I guess, Kevin, one clarification for -- that I wanted to get from you if I could. What was the starting point off of which that $130 million in savings exiting this year was going to be achieved?","Kevin March","Ross, we announced that action with our first quarter result, and we took -- excuse me, the fourth quarter and first quarter results, as I recall. On our fourth quarter, we took the charge, and first quarter, for embedded processing. So that's the start there. In the second quarter we took the charge for the Japan restructuring. So it's a bit of a mixed start, if you will. So it'd be a little hard to do a direct correlation, but again the math you should be using is $130 million annualized savings by the time we end the year with 85% of it coming out of OpEx.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. And I guess as my follow-up, in the past, and I don\u2019t know if you guys are going to do this anymore now that you've started to split out the revenues in a different way, but in the past, in the middle of the year you would say what the revenues by end-market did midyear. Is that something that you can give us now?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, Ross, we're really just planning on getting those numbers on an annualized basis, as I answered Jim's question earlier, you know, we'll provide revenue on a quarterly basis, just a color on what's happened in each of the markets. And that's what we've decided to move to.","So with that, we can move to our next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. Thank you, Ron, and best wishes in your retirement.","First question, you talked a lot about strength being broad-based, but was there any segments of markets in Q3 that are relatively weak, you know, whether that's seasonal or even secular [ph]?","Dave Pahl","From an end-market standpoint, Tore, the only market that we saw a decline was in personal electronics, and that was -- I'm sorry, was it third quarter or second quarter?","Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Q3 guidance.","Dave Pahl","I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, again, I somewhat addressed that, that we're really not trying to get into the color by end-market or our product segments or that. We realty just focus on the top-line number overall.","Did you have a follow-on, Tore?","Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah, that's fair. My follow-up is, did you have a change in your distribution strategy at all in the quarter, or are you planning it? I'm thinking, you know, are you going to go to certain customers more of a direct business or?","Dave Pahl","No. We haven't had any change in the quarter. I can't say that we had changes to our business arrangement with distributors, you know, on a periodic basis over the years. And for example, if we just go back a few years ago as an example, we implemented the consignment program with distribution. So now we've got more than half of our overall revenues supported by distribution. So they're going to continue to be a very important part of our business. We're focused on growing our revenues overall, which will mean growing our revenues with them. As we've invested in catalog products and in industrial markets, we want to work with the distributors to be able to broaden our reach with customers. So we will do things that will optimize both our resources and theirs, but any specifics of details that we've got going on with changes we just won't get into.","Okay? With that, we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We're going to take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Research.","Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research","Thank you. Dave, just looking at the end-market breakdown one more time -- I apologize, I know this question has been asked several times. You gave us the year-on-year trends. Can you also talk about sequential trends from Q1 to Q2?","Dave Pahl","Sure, yeah. I think aside from the increase in calculators, communication, and personal electronics actually grew the most, and we did see a benefit in personal electronics, led by a strong quarter in PC and notebooks. We did see industrial, enterprise systems and automotive all contribute to the growth sequentially. So if you look underneath that, and industrial as an example, we had -- we've got over a dozen sectors inside of industrial. So with that we saw areas like factory automation, control, smart grid, motor drives [ph] drive that. In automotive, on a sequential basis, we had growth in all sectors overall, and that was led by ADAS. So those are the things that drove the revenue in the quarter sequentially.","Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research","Okay, great. Thank you. And then on the connectivity fund [ph], Dave, I think you mentioned you participate in a number of different standards, if I recall correctly, you sold the smartphone business a while back. My question is, is there anything preventing you from participating in the wearables market, if you think about the watches, et cetera?","Dave Pahl","No. In fact, you know, you'll -- I actually wear some of those products to track my steps, and it has quite a bit of TI contact [ph] both from power management standpoint and other analog products, as well as connectivity. So the beauty of having a catalog portfolio is that the incremental cost to engage a customer, the tools and the support are all in place. So we can very readily and very easily support markets like that overall.","So thanks, Srini. We'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners","Yeah, thanks. Just a clarification on being opportunistic in acquisition of manufacturing assets. Are you -- is it for taking a long view on increasing capacity or are you removing bottlenecks in the manufacturing flow? It looks like Richardson and analog, there's still a lot of headroom here.","Kevin March","Yeah, Ian, it can be a little bit of both. If we see bottlenecks popping up some place and we're able to go ahead and pick up equipment inexpensively, or if we anticipate that a flow is going to become a bigger, more important revenue source in the future, we can go ahead and pick up for that. Or just outright new factories for example, and what's what we did when we bought the assembly test site in Chengdu, China. It was an entire that we had bought in that case.","So we'll play -- we'll take advantage whatever opportunity presents itself, especially if the finances are compelling.","Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners","Great. And this commentary on connectivity growing faster within embedded, I'm assuming, you know, we're talking about internet of things and wearables, sockets [ph] that could attach with micro-controllers and power management, and do you have a sense of IOT [ph] mix, how much of it is more like industrial, military, first responder type of applications with long cycles?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, if you look at our -- the product portfolio, we actually support a dozen or so different wireless technologies, so, whether you need Bluetooth flow energy or WiFi, we've got GPS, we have multiple sub gigahertz standards, including things like ZigBee. So whatever label that you want to put on to that, essentially if things are getting smarter and more connected, we've got a broad range of catalog products in which to show the customers, and we can be fairly agnostic on how to solve their problem and bring really the best bit of the technology to whatever markets they're trying to enter. And oftentimes we'll find manufacturers that have, you know, never had any wireless experience, so they'll want to go to the web, they'll want to contact our local apps people, and get support for that product, and they really don't have to become RF experts. And so they can focus their time on other things. And that's a combination that's working real well.","Okay. With that, we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes, thank you. I wonder if I could go back to some of your earlier comments with regard to the consignment revenue. I guess just to clarify that, I guess what you're saying is the higher percentage of fulfillment through consignment that you're expecting for third quarter is what's pulling down the book-to-bill. And I think in the past you've talked about your book-to-bill for the non-consignment portion of your business. Could you tell us what is and perhaps that's a better indicator of the end-market booking trends?","Kevin March","Yeah, on the -- what I talked about, Chris, was that we've had a conversion of more products into consignment going to distribution. And so that suppressed the book-to-bill a little bit that we just came out of the quarter with.","If you keep in mind that -- oh gosh, how much of our revenue is going through consignment now? Probably 50% for the total company is going through consignment. What that really means is that book-to-bill for that consignment revenue is by definition one. And so the book-to-bill that we reported at the company level really just applies to the other half of the revenue. So that 1.01 that we just reported in very simple terms will be 1.02 because it really applies to non-consignment portion of the business. And again that was suppressed somewhat as a result of a conversion from a previously directly sale to a consigned arrangement.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. And Chris, I\u2019ll just add, in second quarter, you know, we delivered a 10% sequential growth and our book-to-bill was 1.03. You know, if you look at orders, they were up 9% sequentially. So, you know, that book-to-bill number is just one number, and as Kevin said, it's got some noise in it. So it's one consideration that we look at as we put together the demand forecast.","You have a follow-on, Chris?","Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes, sure. For my follow-on, I guess I'll ask a little bit of a bigger picture question. TI over the years has always been a cyclical company, just the function of the industry. But as you guys are operating the business a little bit differently now, your focus is on some different end-markets. Just interested in your view of, you know, going forward, what does that do to the cyclicality of TI as we go over the next couple of years?","Kevin March","Yeah, I think you're spot-on, Chris. As you look at the mix of what's going on inside our portfolio, in years past, as you observed, we had some big verticals, certain end-markets you might be able to take a look at, and our business cycle with that end-market in addition to any so-called semiconductor cycle itself.","Now as we have industrial and automotive becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue and the market to which our products are being shipped into, arguably we would see -- likely see less impact as a result of big vertical fluctuations and begin to see a little bit more correlation between TI's growth going forward and the global GDP as a whole. So we'll probably track more to the economy as opposed to a particular single end-market.","That's not to say that we escaped the semi-cycle if there still is one. It's simply to say that our fortunes are more tied much more broadly than they have been ever in the past, and therefore they're much more reflective of, you know, how does the overall global GDP tend to expand over time.","Dave Pahl","Okay. And with that, operator, we have time for one last caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Thanks so much. Guys, based on your current schedule of depreciation, and if you assume that CapEx remains at roughly 4% of sales, when is depreciation going to hit the level of CapEx? Is this is a 2016 event or is this sometime beyond that?","Kevin March","Yeah, Tim, it's unlikely that we would see CapEx and depreciation converge prior to 2016. So that's probably a good starting point for you to build your models with.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-on, Tim?","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Okay, great. Okay, great. And then a question about gross margin drop-through. You know, the number has been a little bit above 75% the last couple of quarters. But is that still the right number to think about going forward for the gross margin drop-through? I know people were talking about operating margin drop-through, but I'm wondering about gross margin drop-through. Thanks.","Kevin March","Well, certainly we're operating at a higher level now, Tim, than we have in years past. And we talked a number of years ago about a long-term -- a long window of time that that fall-through during the course of a business cycle historically has been a pretty good indicator to follow. But in any one time period, it's always been -- it doesn't really apply very well.","More importantly, going forward we'll operate into much higher level of gross than we have ever in the past, and I would expect that to continue to drop through quite richly, and importantly, drop through as free cash flow, that we can continue to return to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buyback.","Dave Pahl","Okay, great. And with that, I will turn it over to Ron to make some final remarks.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. As we wrap this up, let me just close by saying the past 32 years working at TI really has been a good -- I'd say great ride.","For Dave and Kevin, let me simply pass on the request and words of advice that had been passed down from generations of TI managers, and that, please don't screw it up.","Thank you all for joining us. A replay of the call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","That does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"20474":["Texas Instruments, Incorporated.

LLC","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the Web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year over year from currency exchange rates, as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing together grew slightly year over year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago.","With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from the year-ago period, and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.","We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's returned to shareholders who are productively invested in the business. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.","Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Power Management also grew, Silicon Valley Analog was even, and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog.","Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew.","In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom ASIC products, which are highly concentrated in wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined, while calculators grew.","In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 31\/2 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory's managed with our consignment program.","Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically by end market, automotive had strong growth, with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat, in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others.","Personal electronics grew in total due to one large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside of personal electronics declined, including PCs, as we expected. Communications equipment declined primarily due to the wireless infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected.","In general, as we look to the third quarter, the strength in demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year over year, and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth.","Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion, or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from the year-ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points.","Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million were down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense.","Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from the year ago, as we focused our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. As our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of five-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. Including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%.","On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our February capital management call.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion, or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And, as we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.","In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we've said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total is expected to be weaker year over year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72.","Acquisition charges, which are a noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year.","In summary, even in a weaker market environment, such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the four attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivers strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes, in combination, are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continuing returns to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Keith?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We can take our first question from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess a little bit of a longer-term question. Could you just give us your sense \u2013 having the benefit of six, seven months of hindsight \u2013 on why the semi market is kind of sucking wind right now? And then I think the last time things were like this was 2011 and 2012, so if you could give us a sense of comparison on how things are right now versus 2011 and 2012? Is it better? Is it worse? Is it the same? Do we not know?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Chris, I'll go ahead and take a stab at that, I guess. I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year. And just toning down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of event. The market's getting a bit more cautious, especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you hear out of Europe, things you hear out of China. But the fact is the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market, macro driven, not necessarily a semi cycle per se. We continue to see lead times are quite short, cancellations remain low, distributor inventories at historically low levels, as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going in the second half than what people thought coming into the first half.","As to comparisons to 2011-2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan that I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think these are really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Chris.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Do you have a follow-on?","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, I guess just to dig in a little more. Maybe can you give us a little color on linearity? And then in terms of the end markets, you talked about softness in communication and the new softness in industrial. Maybe just go down your end markets as far as which is stable, which is getting better, which is getting worse?","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. So I'll just make a comment on both revenue and order linearity in the quarter. In both cases, revenue and orders increased each month during the quarter. I think as you look at the end market detail, as I just had walked through in general, we saw automotive was strong, with all the sectors inside of that growing \u2013 or all but one growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was flat. Just contrasting that to last quarter's year-over-year growth, we didn't see growth there. And it was incrementally weaker than we had expected. And as we had talked about inside of there, we really saw about half of the sectors increase, and that, of course, was offset by declines in the other sectors.","Personal electronics, as we talked about, grew in total, due to specifically one large customer. And outside of that customer, actually saw almost every sector decline, including PCs, as we were expecting. Comms infrastructure, as we mentioned, was impacted by \u2013 or comms equipment was impacted by wireless infrastructure, and that was down 50% from a year ago. So \u2013 and that actually was weaker than what we had expected when we started the quarter. And then the last, enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. So that's kind of a summary of what we saw by end market.","So thanks, Chris, and we'll move to the next caller.","Operator","Okay, and that question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the Q2 results, you talked about incrementally weaker trends in Industrial. This has been a particular focus by the market. Can you just talk about the geographical trends within your industrial business? There's a lot of concern around demand trends in industrial in Europe and China. Love to get some color from you guys.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Sure, Harlan, so let me just tell you what happened with the revenues in the quarter. So year-over-year revenue was down, as we mentioned before, 2%. Europe was down the most, and Japan was also down. Asia was flat, while the U.S. was up. From a sequential standpoint, revenue was up, led by the U.S. Asia and Europe were both about even sequentially while Japan was down.","So we're always cautious. We'll give you that information and walk through it, but we're always cautious, because that's reflective of where we ship product versus where it's actually consumed. So \u2013 and it's really hard for us to see regional weakness unless it's extremely pronounced in a market like industrial, just because of the tens of thousands of customers that make up that market.","So do you have a follow-on, Harlan?","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. So I think last quarter you said \u2013 the team said that they were going to bring down utilizations. Did you in fact bring them down? And, directionally, where do you expect them to head into the third quarter? And dollar inventory stayed relatively flat. Does the team expect this to come down in Q3, just given the weaker demand profile?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Harlan, the \u2013 in fact we did reduce utilization in the factories in the second quarter. And inventory actually came in right about where we expected that, 126 days. And given the outlook that we have just described to you, we do intend to further reduce factory utilization in the third quarter, and we expect the result of that is that our inventories will probably come down somewhat in the third quarter as a result of the reductions that were planned for Q3 as well as the Q2. It just takes a while for that to flow through the system.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Harlan. And next caller, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. First question is on consolidation. And you guys have been very clear in your articulation of what you look for and what the parameters are over time. But I have a couple specific questions about consolidation in the current environment. Does the current environment, where revenues for the industry are in some pretty sharp declines \u2013 does that change the view on near-term consolidation potential in the sense that you worry about paying a multiple for a cash flow stream that's going to wind up being much lower over the next 12, 18, 24 months than what it currently is? Or does that create more of an incremental opportunity? I'd love your perspective on that.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Jim, the timing doesn't enter into our thinking. So with some of the points you just brought up \u2013 although they make for interesting discussion, they don't actually alter the way we tend to think about M&A. As we've discussed in the past, the first and most important thing is that any potential M&A consideration has to be consistent with our strategy. And in our mind that's going be something that's going to be focused on helping drive our success in the Analog space.","And then beyond that, as you were alluding to in your comments there, we have been and expect to continue to be quite disciplined on making sure that we can get a return on what we've spent. Clearly, at some of the prices today that you might see of certain companies out there and you factor in a premium \u2013 I'm looking at what I've seen in some other companies \u2013 getting a 3% return, 4% return doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy for maximizing shareholder value. And so our inclination is to make sure returns can see their way past our cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe, and we'll stay disciplined on that front.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you. And for the follow-up, how do you think about what the company's long-term growth rate is in this environment? I mean, it was good last year. We're in a tougher environment now. We're kind of down on a year-over-year basis for revenues this quarter and maybe flattish for the year if we look at normal seasonality for the back half. This might be overly negative to kind of take this snapshot in time for long-term growth. Maybe last year was overly positive. Do you think something kind of in between what you'll achieve this year and what you achieved last year is a reasonable view on what long-term normalized revenue growth could be?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","I think you're probably thinking about it right, Jim, is that you should look at it over periods of time like that, and not start from the wrong quarter. At a high level, we take a look, and we make the assumption that the semiconductor market will continue to grow at, call it, 2x the global GDP, and that's on increased content into industrial and automotive that will continue to drive demand. It's then a question of what do you think the GDP's going to do over the long term, the global GDP?","And clearly it does appear that \u2013 and certainly in the last three, four years, and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry is, again, in our view, will probably grow at about 2x the global GDP, and the global GDP is the real wildcard here, is trying to figure out how fast that'll grow. And we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any real robust growth to help us, and therefore we have to focus on execution and making ourselves stronger internally.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. And I'd add to that, that our business model is robust. Even in a weak environment like this, it throws off lots of cash. And we've got the capacity to support much stronger rates of growth, if that were to show up. So it'll be a lot more fun if we get into an environment where GDP growth is stronger and everyone can argue what the multiplier on semiconductor growth rates overall are. But we can still operate and produce lots of cash even in these weaker markets. And we'll look forward to having more fun when it's stronger.","So thanks, Jim, and -","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sounds good. Thank you.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Go to our next caller, please.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kevin, I guess the first question is you took some utilization action in the June quarter, but gross margins were actually up sequentially and very healthy. Is the right way to think about this is the June quarter utilization actions impact September, September impacts December? And, specifically, can you help me think about how I should be thinking about the gross margin range in the September quarter around some of the utilization actions you're taking?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, so Jim, we've got a couple things going on there. Clearly as we see more of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive, that has an attractive profit mix. And so you saw some of that in the second quarter. You heard Dave's prepared remarks talking about strength in automotive that we saw in the quarter. So that's clearly having a benefit to our gross margins, even in the light of lightening up on our utilization a little bit. You are correct in that utilization changes don't have an immediate impact. They tend to \u2013 it takes a few months for it to roll through the system, so some of that was in second quarter. More of it will be in third quarter.","We also have lower overall manufacturing costs; as we're beginning to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off we're becoming much more efficient in our factories; we're getting more and more of our revenue off of much lower-cost 300 millimeter. So you've got a number of things combined that are keeping those margins in a pretty healthy state. As we look into next quarter, I wouldn't expect a significant \u2013 any kind of material change in that particular metric in third quarter.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. As then as my follow-up, guys, you guys are constantly kind of pruning the portfolio. One of the things that's been talked about is whether or not you're going to plan to do sort of power on the new Skylake platform. I'm just kind of curious as to how the PC business and your desire to want to participate there is impacting either the June quarter results or, more importantly, the guide in September? Is there sort of a hit coming because you're not going to participate there? Again, if there is, can you help us quantify the size of the PC business today and kind of where it goes over time?","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. So, John, what you're seeing in our results has nothing to do with the investments on a Vcore product line. And I'll just say that we continually look at our investments, and we want to obviously invest in places where we think that that will lead to sustainable revenue, a differentiated position and solid returns. So there's portions within Vcore that are more attractive and less commoditized than others. So we're continuing to make those investments. So we know that there have been rumors out there that we're exiting the space in total, and that's not true.","But, again, these are fairly small tweaks to where we direct our R&D resources. And those teams are off investing in other areas and producing products that we believe will just give us longer-term better results. So I'll contrast that to a market where we may have exited like wireless, where we're actually reducing and exiting a market. And we're not doing that here.","So I hope that helps. We can go to our next caller, please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. A product mix question first: Within your Analog space, you guys obviously have done a great job over time. A little curious as to an explanation why the HVAL side is growing so much faster year over year over the last couple quarters versus HPA specifically? I recall asking questions about HPA investments in the past, and that seemed to be an area of extreme focus given its high profitability. But the growth doesn't seem to be keeping up with HVAL. So any color on that will be helpful.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Sure, Ross. Yeah, I think when you look at both SVA, as well as HPA, those businesses have different exposures to various end markets. And actually both of those businesses have a higher exposure to both industrial as well as communications equipment. You'll see a business like HVAL that will have a higher exposure to personal electronics.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","And automotive.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","And automotive. Yeah, good point. So that's really what you're seeing in those results. Do you have a follow-up?","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Switching gears quickly, but kind of a follow-on to John's earlier question, any sort of color you can provide on the OpEx side. It's helpful to have gross margin relatively flattish, but how do you adjust the OpEx given that the revenues have been a little challenged looking forward?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Ross, we've already taken action on the OpEx side. We had announced, I think a year and a half ago now, actions that we were taking in Embedded Processing and Japan, and those are pretty much complete now. You're seeing those benefit OpEx in the results that we turned in the last couple quarters. These short-term fluctuations in revenue \u2013 we don't let those lead us to rash decisions that could have a negative impact on us. We make longer-term decisions based upon strategy.","As we look into third quarter, if you look at the last couple of years, 2Q to 3Q, OpEx has been flat to roughly down. I don't expect anything different than recent history as we go into third quarter of this year.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Ross. And we can go to our next caller, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. For the first question, you mentioned this 50% decline in wireless infrastructure. If you could help us quantify what proportion of your sales that is now versus last year? And the thing that I'm really curious about is that \u2013 and it's not just a Texas Instruments question; we are seeing that from Xilinx and others \u2013 that there is really no slowdown in mobile data consumption, there is no slowdown in LTE users, so why are you seeing such a large decline in wireless infrastructure buildouts? Is it just an excess inventory of base stations? Is it a move away from your products? Is it a share issue? If you could help me understand that, that would be very helpful.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Sure, yeah. So, Vivek, our communications equipment market is \u2013 at the end of last year was about 17%. But the largest sector inside of that was wireless infrastructure at about 10%. So we've given you the color on half the size. We haven't gone through all the end equipment percentages, but that'll get you into the ZIP code of the impact to our business.","And it's interesting that you bring it up. It continues to actually be a very good market for us. It's one that we're continuing to make investments. We had dialed back some of the investments a year or so ago inside of Embedded Processing, and that's really a view that that market over time, that carrier CapEx isn't going to go up, that it probably will decline slightly as we look over the next five and 10 years and perhaps longer. But carrier CapEx isn't going to zero. And that revenue will return. It has been notoriously just a choppy market. And it's just the dynamics of the market, the way that the tenders go out, the way that the OEMs have to prepare to deliver that product. Oftentimes it's in a 30- or 60-day window, so this isn't new to us. We're used to it. We can still make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash from this market, so we'll continue to do that. But it is just choppy. So that's just a characteristic. And I think as you talk to other semiconductor suppliers that supply into that market, that's pretty consistent, I think, with what all of us see.","So do you have a follow-up, Vivek?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on my follow-up, wondering if 75% is still that right incremental gross margin number to think of, because you are guiding sales at the midpoint to go up somewhat, but you're saying gross margins will be flattish. And as part of that, does this slowdown in sales have any impact on how soon you move your capacity over to 300 millimeter? Thank you.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Vivek, the 75% fall-through is still probably a pretty good one to use, but keep in mind that it's noisy from quarter to quarter. It's something you should look over a multiquarter period as you move through time. Clearly you'll get good product margin fall-through as we go into next quarter, but as I mentioned we're also dialing back some of the factory starts, so you have moving parts inside there. But when you look over a longer period of time than just a quarter, that's when you start seeing that 75%.","As to migrating product to \u2013 I think you said 450 millimeter.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","He meant 300 millimeter.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Okay. I was going to say, we don't have that on the radar.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","He's thinking well ahead, yeah.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","For 300 millimeter, we will continue to do what we have been doing in the past, and that is many of our new products that are released are being released on 300 millimeter, and that becomes even more valuable to the company as we move forward. Keep in mind what we talked back in the February capital call, that is in addition to our Richardson fab, which is capable of about $5 billion of total 300-millimeter Analog revenue, we have also begun the conversion of our DMOS6 factory, which will provide an additional $3 billion of Analog revenue capability. So with that kind of conversion under way, clearly new products that we're releasing are being biased towards 300 millimeter versus 200. Active products on 200, for the most part, will continue where they're at.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. And I'll just add to that, as we had indicated before, the qualification, as Kevin said, of DMOS6 second version is under way, and we expect the qualification to be completed by the end of the year. We're still on track for that.","So thank you, Vivek, and we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Christopher Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thank you. I wanted to dig into the industrial market a little more deeply. You had talked about that being a bit weaker than expected in the quarter. And then \u2013 recognize that you're going into one of the seasonally weaker quarters for industrial. And I'm sure you heard the commentary from one of your competitors earlier today. Can you help us to just get some perspective on what your customers are telling you in that market? And I know you don't like to give commentary going forward on what's baked into your guidance, but to just kind of help ground us in how you're thinking about that particular market at this point?","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. Chris, not a lot to add. We did \u2013 it was \u2013 again, use the word incrementally weaker. We gave you the color that we saw growth in half the sectors, and that was offset. So even inside of that, there's a bit of choppiness. I think as we look forward, obviously as we get the demand signals both in orders as well as from what we can see from consignment, through our distributors, there's signals that we look at there. And as Kevin mentioned earlier, I think people are just taking a more cautious outlook into third quarter. So besides that, probably don't have too much to add. Kevin, I don't know if you -","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, the only thing I'd remind you of is that industrial was 31% of our revenue in 2014. And my recollection is that no single sector in that market was bigger than 4%. So we're talking about a lot of really small customers. So there's not really one customer that can give us a signal what's going on. It seems to be a broad-based reconsideration on the part of participants in that space as to their outlook for growth for the second half.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Good point. Chris, do you have a follow-on?","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Sure. Just as following onto that, perhaps you could talk about what you think customers are doing with inventory now? And I know you had talked about your distributors taking some inventory out of the channel again as they likely reconsider what's going on in the second half. Do you expect that the end customers are doing similar? And, on top of that, what do you expect the distributors do with inventory as they go forward? Do you think the inventory levels can get leaner than where they are right now?","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. So in general we believe that customer inventories are lean. As we worked our way through the reports and some of the anecdotal \u2013 from last quarter's reports, as well as the anecdotal information that we get from our sales teams. And of course there's always the exceptions like within wireless infrastructure, as that market goes through its adjustments.","So with inventory in our distributors at 31\/2 weeks, that is a historically low period in my tenure as well as Kevin's. So \u2013 and we really think that's reflective, Chris, of confidence from distributors that they believe that they can get the product that they need from us. Obviously it's driven overall because of the consignment programs that allow them just operationally to run at those levels. And I think there is a belief that confidence in stable lead times and availability of product is probably working its way out into the customer base as well; harder for us to actually have that direct visibility. As Kevin talked about, we're talking 100,000 customers, so it's hard to have that collectively.","So thanks, Chris, and I will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","And we'll go to Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you. Kevin, you talked about orders increasing every month in the quarter. Do you have any order commentary quarter to date? And I'm assuming we're entering Q3 with a relatively strong backlog. How much more conservative are turns order assumptions to meet guidance?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah. Ian, as we did mention earlier on, orders increased each month in the second quarter, and I will just say as to orders for this quarter, they're consistent with the guidance range that we gave early in the call. We did have a book-to-bill in second quarter of 1.01, so we did build a little bit of backlog, but I wouldn't call it a dramatic amount. It's consistent, though, I think, with the outlook that we have offered for third quarter.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. And I'll just remind you, Ian \u2013 I'm sure you probably know that we've got 60% of our revenues that go through distribution. 60% of that is supported by consignment, and about 55% of TI's revenues overall is by consignment. So I'd just be careful with the book-to-bill, and part of the reason why we don't highlight it is because it just applies to a smaller portion of our actual revenues, and that backlog isn't necessarily reflective completely of the demand that we actually see.","So do you have a follow-on?","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. I think you've done a really good job of highlighting your competitive advantages \u2013 broad portfolio, growing into your manufacturing assets. I mean, what's the response, though, to scenarios where there could be some demand in end markets on a permanent secular decline? I mean, if you look at comms infrastructure, PCs, some of the consumer markets, I mean, how do you address the potential for some permanent declines in some of these end markets?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Well, there's \u2013 been in this for quite a long time, Ian \u2013 there's always some market that's in decline and other markets that are actually in a growth phase. So the examples you just offered, if in fact they turn out to be in a secular decline, the offsetting markets for that, the most obvious one is automotive, where we're seeing significant content growth \u2013 not just us but many in the industry \u2013 seeing significant content growth. And we're still in the very early stages of that content penetrating automobiles. So that's probably a secular growth market that I would suggest would probably add for a decade or more. So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general and for us in particular, because we've been focused on there for a number of years now.","And then there's the broader industrial market, where we're seeing an increasing usage of semiconductors and equipment in those markets that simply were never used before. And as people are using semiconductors in those spaces they're finding new applications and needs for more semiconductors. So while there may be some markets or sectors that could be in secular decline, there are others that are in secular growth. And in general, that leads us to the belief that I commented on earlier in the call, that we think the industry overall will grow at about 2x the global GDP because you've got these kind of underlying changes going on in how semiconductors are being used across our economy.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, and I could add, too, that even if you look at a market like PCs that probably over the next 10 years and 20 years will be on a decline like that, we can take two actions. One is we'll spend differently today than we would have spent 10 years and 15 years ago inside of that market. But we can still find opportunities where products will actually live through one product cycle to the next and still have long-lived positions even inside of a market like that. And certainly PCs aren't going away anytime soon. So there's still quite a bit of money that can be made in those markets.","So thank you, Ian, and we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","And we can take the next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. Dave and Kevin, we're just trying to understand the difference in the commentary on the order patterns that you guys are seeing versus Linear. Same kind of diversified businesses; in fact, they have very similar \u2013 they don't have consumer as you do, but then you also had infrastructure, which is down very hard. So could you help us understand what's going on there? And then I had a very quick follow-up.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","You know, Ambrish, I cannot offer you any insight into Linear's order patterns. They clearly are the most qualified to do that. I can simply tell you what we saw, and that is our orders increased each of the three months as we came through \u2013 or two of the three months. In other words, May was up over April, and June was up over May as we came through 2Q. We certainly are in different markets, and that could possibly be an explanation, but I just don't know enough about how their order book works to be able to help you with a contrast between the two companies.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's fair, Kevin. My follow-up is on the factory loadings. Is the right way to also think about, when you're bringing the utilization down, that's mostly on the 200 millimeter, and the 300 millimeter continues to creep up?","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","That's actually not a bad way to think about it, Ambrish, because in fact the way that we are operating the 300-millimeter fab today, our fab, is near full equipped utilization. In other words, we don't have it equipped to full capacity, but to the extent that we have it equipped, we try to keep it quite highly loaded. So the adjustments that we take on loadings generally impact the 200. There may be some impact in 300 as well, but it generally would impact the 200-millimeter factories.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. And I'll just add that any product that runs any measurable volume will often source in multiple factories, so it could actually be sourced in a 200-millimeter fab as well as a 300-millimeter fab. And as you know, the economics of getting 40% lower cost per chip on a 300-millimeter obviously will tilt us into starting that 300-millimeter wafer.","So thank you, Ambrish. And we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, not to beat a dead horse, but I guess another one on the industrial sector, is what kind of exposure do you have to the energy patch and your vision for whether that business has troughed and\/or there's further declines ahead?","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, C.J., as Kevin pointed out, last year 31% of our revenues industrial. The largest sector inside of industrial is factory automation. And that was 4%, so you're probably down well in \u2013 getting into the very low single-digit percentages by the time you're down onto that. So it's very, very diverse from that standpoint. Do you have a follow-up?","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I do. I guess given your perspective in terms of your leverage to personal electronics, calculators, DLP, would love to hear your thoughts on the global consumer and the health of the consumer and willingness to step up and spend during this macro malaise or pause or whatever you want to call it.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Well, if you look at our personal electronics market, it was actually up. And it was up because of our exposure in our customer base. So to the extent that there's compelling products out there that people want, that will drive demand. So you see that stepping up. You take that one customer out, of course, we saw declines in almost every sector inside of personal electronics. So you kind of have the good with the bad, somewhat of a mix on that front.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, I might just add it's probably not so much consumer willingness to consume those things. It's more is there something interesting for them to spend their money on. And certain customers are much more successful at that than others.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you. C.J., did you have a follow-up? No, okay. Maybe one last caller, please.","Operator","Okay. And we can go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you so much. Actually I had two. I guess first of all, if you look at 2015 as the whole year, usually you're targeting to sort of grow roughly 2x GDP. We don't know what GDP is going be, but if you assume a seasonal fourth calendar quarter, it implies that revenue this year is down like 250 basis points. So it definitely seems to be undergrowing whatever GDP comes out to be this this year. So I guess my question is do you think that any of this is share? Will you end up to have lost any market share this year? I know you usually target up about 40 bps per year. And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah. Tim, so what we're talking about, again, long-term growth rate was how the questions asked earlier, and long-term growth rate, we believe, will be about 2x global GDP. Just like you see noise in the quarters, you're probably going to see noise in the years. For example, last year the industry arguably grew considerably faster than 2x global GDP. This year it's apt to grow less than global GDP. So I think you're just going to have that kind of noise to deal with. I don't think it can be mechanically imposed into a formula with precision.","As we look out, for the reasons that we talked about, increasing penetration in certain markets especially auto and industrial, that will continue to require semiconductor content, and there'll be growth inside that. From a market share standpoint, we'll be able to answer that at the end of the year. But I'd say we're off to a darn good start so far.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. And I'd just point out that when you look at our market share gains, they've averaged 30 to 40 basis points. We've had years where we've eked out 10 basis points, and a knockout year is 100 basis points. So inside of that, we've had a range of outcomes. So do you have a follow-on, Tim?","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","I do. Yes, thanks. So the guidance is like 400 basis points below what the five-year seasonal is. Maybe you talked about this and I sort of missed it. But can you sort of try to pinpoint what \u2013 the primary sort of either geography or end market that can potentially explain that gap? I guess I'm thinking about China in particular. Can you just sort of help us cover that gap? Thanks.","Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Tim, we don't believe that there's something called a seasonal average in our space. When you go and take a look at any of those quarters, the variation is so wide that there's not really anything meaningful in there. I think you look at those 2Q to 3Q growth rates and you see zeros to high-single digits, and I don't think you can divine too much out of that.","I think we have to look at it in the context of the current global environment. Certainly a lot of negative news flow coming out of Europe and some out of China and so on. We had a slow start to the year in the Americas because of weather and the port issues on the West Coast. So I think what we're seeing is what we talked about early in the call, which is that on a macro level, our customers are looking and adjusting their expectation for growth in the second half, and they're tweaking that down a little bit, versus what they had anticipated coming into the year.","David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you very much, Tim. And with that, thank you all for joining. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","Okay. And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 7. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.","Let me start with the market environment. Revenue in the fourth quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. We expected the environment to be weak again last quarter, and it was. Visibility remains poor, and it is difficult to predict our business trends with precision. That said, we expect revenue in the first quarter to be seasonal except for those wireless mobile product lines that we are exiting. We continue to believe that inventory levels at OEMs and our distribution channels remain low.","Even in this weak demand environment, our strategy is producing strong results. Notably, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and almost $3 billion in the year. This is a result of a strengthening product portfolio as more of our revenue comes from Analog and Embedded Processing products, 72% in the fourth quarter. It is also a result of our strategic capacity investments over the past few years that have allowed us to reduce capital spending and will now allow us to maintain capital spending at historically low levels in the years ahead, while continuing to have a strong capability for growth.","We continue to return our excess capital to our shareholders last year, returning 90% of free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends. Kevin will provide more on this in a few minutes.","Let me now walk through the quarter's results. Revenue of $2.98 billion, declined 13% from a year ago and 12% sequentially. Analog revenue declined 2% from a year ago and 9% sequentially. From a year ago, Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog, both catalog-oriented product lines, declined, while High Volume Analog & Logic was about even and Power Management grew. Sequentially, revenues declined in all product lines. In this sequential comparison, we were encouraged that Silicon Valley Analog performed about the same as the other product lines, despite the additional revenue headwinds associated with our conversion of its distribution business to a consignment inventory model. We estimate that we are about 1\/3 of the way through the consignment program transition for this product line.","Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year ago, mostly due to higher revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure, although revenue from catalog products and automotive products was also higher. Sequentially, Embedded Processing declined 10% with lower revenue in all 3 major product lines.","Wireless revenue declined 56% from a year ago. Baseband revenue fell to $64 million and was the majority of the decline, although OMAP applications processors and connectivity products also declined significantly. Sequentially, Wireless revenue fell 2% with connectivity products down, OMAP even and baseband revenue up.","Our other segment revenues declined 7% from a year ago and 25% sequentially. From a year ago, the decline was mostly due to the expiration of transitional supply agreements, although DLP revenue also declined. Revenue from custom ASIC products and royalties increased. Sequentially, revenue declined primarily due to the seasonal drop in calculator revenue. Revenue from DLP products and custom ASIC products also declined, while royalties increased. The sequential revenue was also impacted by the non-recurrence of $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with the 2011 Japan earthquake.","Turning to distribution. Revenues -- or resales grew 4% from a year ago and declined 2% from the prior quarter. Distributors reduced their TI inventory by several days in the quarter to a little below 6 weeks.","Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin P. March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges and benefits in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the fourth quarter were $88 million. We recorded charges on the restructuring charges\/other line of our income statement of $12 million, associated with the previously announced planned closure of several older factories. Together, these acquisition and restructuring charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.06 in the quarter as we had expected and included in our guidance.","Additionally, we also reported charges associated with our Wireless business restructuring that we announced in November. At that time, we expected the associated charges to be about $325 million. Charges were higher than we had expected at $351 million. We had expected the EPS impact of this charge to be $0.21, and this was the amount we included in our mid-quarter guidance. It actually came in at about $0.23. Combined, these 3 charges round at $0.28 of EPS in the quarter.","Finally, we had a discrete tax benefit in the quarter, primarily associated with additional U.S. tax benefits that we received from manufacturing related to the years 2000 through 2006. This tax benefit and the associated interest was not in our outlook and provided a $0.15 benefit to the earnings per share in the fourth quarter.","So let me summarize the impact of the charges and the discrete tax benefits. Reported earnings per share was $0.23. The net of these items I just discussed was a negative impact of $0.13. Since most of you excludes these items from your submissions to First Call, the non-GAAP earnings per share would round to $0.36.","Gross profit of $1.45 billion was 48.5% of revenue, a decrease of 17% sequentially. The decline was mostly the result of a lower product revenue through the non-recurrence of $60 million in business interruption proceeds associated with the Japan earthquake was also a negative factor. It's also informative to compare gross profit margin from the year-ago quarter. In that quarter, gross profit was negatively impacted by $103 million of acquisition-related charges.","On the surface, this largely explains the 320 basis point increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue. Yet note that revenue is now $441 million lower, and our underutilization expense is $170 million compared with $111 million in the year-ago quarter. If you adjust for the acquisition-related charge and for the underutilization expense, gross margin improved by 270 basis points. I believe this helps highlight the benefit that results as more of our revenue comes from high-quality Analog and Embedded Processing products and as we achieve lower exposure to less profitable Wireless products.","Operating expenses of $855 million declined 7% in both comparisons. From a year ago, this mostly reflects lower product development costs and the synergies we've continued to achieve from our acquisition of National, partially offset by increases in sales and marketing costs in Asia from the prior quarter to reflect combination of tight expense control and seasonally lower holiday and vacation time. We also saw the beginnings of savings from our Wireless restructuring.  Other income and expense was $39 million of income this quarter due to the interest on our discrete tax benefit.  Net income in the fourth quarter was $264 million or $0.23 per share on a GAAP basis.","Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $1.09 billion, up $115 million from the prior year for the year-ago quarter and down $119 million from the prior quarter. We made a $280 million contribution to fund our retirement pension plans in the fourth quarter compared with $102 million in the year-ago quarter and $20 million in the prior quarter. We also lowered our inventory by 91 million in the quarter. Inventory days increased to 103 days from 100 days last quarter. This is a level that is within our planning range.","Free cash flow was $989 million, up $171 million from the year-ago quarter, as capital expenditures declined, and down $66 million from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $96 million in the quarter, down $56 million from a year ago and down $53 million sequentially. Our capital expenditures for the year were less than 4% of revenue. We believe we can continue to operate at the low end of our targeted expenditure range of 4% to 7% of revenue for several years, given our strong capacity position that resulted from our strategic investments over the past few years. As we fill up these low price capacities, the resulting cash flow should be strong.","As you've seen in the past, we continue to be responsible stewards of the capital, returning to our shareholders any amounts that we don't need. Accordingly, we used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock. This was the same as the prior quarter. We also paid dividends in the quarter of $235 million, up 21% from the prior quarter.","Orders of $2.72 billion in the quarter fell by 16% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.91 in the quarter from 0.96 last quarter. The lower backlog reflects the combination of weakening demand, seasonality and customers' unwillingness to commit to extended backlog in an environment of uncertain demand for their own products and short lead times for our products.","Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.91 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue will be down $179 million sequentially. About 3\/4 of this decline is expected to come from the continued wind-down of our wireless mobile product lines, as Wireless segment revenues are expected to decline about $135 million in the first quarter. The remainder of our revenue would therefore decline about 2% at the middle of the range, the decline that is consistent with the seasonal average in the first quarter.","We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.32. We expect first quarter earnings per share results will be negatively affected by about $0.06 from acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%.","We also will have a discrete tax benefit of about $65 million or $0.06 per share that results from the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was made retroactive to the beginning of 2012. Since this wasn't signed into law until January of this year, accounting rules did not allow us to recognize this tax credit in our 2012 income statement. Accordingly, we will record the 2012 R&D tax credit as a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013.","I should note that operating expenses in the first quarter typically increases, reflecting the seasonal timing of increased vacations and holidays in the fourth quarter and annual pay and benefit increases in the first quarter. These pressures will continue to exist this quarter. However, they should be largely offset by savings that are resulting from our Wireless restructuring actions. For the year, our estimate for R&D expense is $1.6 billion. This is down from almost $1.9 billion in 2012 as we benefit from our Wireless restructuring. Our estimate for capital expenditures is $500 million, well below our depreciation estimate of $900 million. Our estimated effective tax rate is 22%.","Most of our comments today have been focused on the quarter and not the year, since 2012 is mostly old news at this point. Let me make a few observations now. Our overall revenue declined $910 million in a weak economic environment. The positive impact of including Silicon Valley Analog slightly more than offset our lower wireless baseband revenue as we exited that product line. That is a trade-off that we are happy to make, and the combination of Analog and Embedded Processing was 70% of our revenue for the year. By comparison, 5 years ago, Analog and Embedded Processing were 47% of our revenue.","For the year, capital expenditures, even as a percent of depressed revenue, hit a new low, and we expect them to stay low. Free cash flow increased to 23% of revenue for 2012. We expect our free cash flow to remain strong in the years ahead, as our solid capacity positions mean that we have almost half of our capacity today, available to support future growth, while we remain -- maintain capital spending at very low levels. As you've seen in the past, our shareholders will benefit as we continue to return our excess capital to you in the form of share repurchases and higher dividends.","With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Before turning to Q&A, let me describe some upcoming changes in our segment financial reporting structure. Beginning with the First Quarter 2013 Financial Report in April, we will transition our segment reporting to align with the company's strategic focus and new organizational structure. The Wireless segment will be eliminated as we have announced that we are winding down investments in these products for the smartphones and consumer tablet markets. Financial results for these products will be included in the other segment for the remainder of their life, which we anticipate will be essentially completed in 2013. Financial results for Wireless products that address embedded applications, a strategic focus for the company, will be reported in the Embedded Processing segments. To facilitate making appropriate adjustments to your financial models, we expect to have historical data for the segments available for you in March.","Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to C.J. Muse from Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I apologize if you already covered this. Curious if you could talk end market. I know you're -- you've cited low visibility, but we would love to hear, I guess, your thoughts on how you see the book-to-bill tracking into Q1 and where you see the recovery coming from.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Well, let's start with the question of -- part of your question where you said basically how is it continuing into Q1. And I guess what I would say is again, maybe -- and before I talk about January, just go back and describe what we saw in the fourth quarter with a bit more detail. So fourth quarter revenue declined each month. So obviously, that left December as the weakest month of the quarter. Book-to-bill, as we've noted, was 0.91 in the quarter. And therefore, as you might guess, the demand visibility is poor. What we've seen thus far in January is that both revenue and orders have strengthened when compared with December. So that leads us to an outlook that is a little stronger than the fourth quarter book-to-bill and orders might otherwise have suggested. And again, as we have said, if you exclude the Wireless segment, the -- from the rest of our revenue, we would expect to decline about 2% at the midpoint of our range, really consistent with normal seasonality for a first quarter. By end market, I don't have a lot of color. Probably, the best takeaway is that what we saw in fourth quarter was broadly weak. I'll walk through a couple of end markets. Computing clearly continued to be weak in the quarter. Communications was weak. I think we gave you some pretty good visibility directly into what we were seeing with handsets and tablets. But again, there are some TI-specific trends in there as we're exiting some of those product lines. From an infrastructure standpoint, particularly base stations, again, I would describe that market as weak with spending levels by operators in U.S., Europe and China all remaining constrained to this point. Consumer would maybe be an area where I would say things are somewhat mixed. TV sales remain weak, generally reflecting the economy. Industrial, same, weak. Automotive inside of industrial would be mixed regionally with the sales in the U.S., strong but China and Europe, both weak. And those were more what we were seeing by end market in the fourth quarter, I don't really have any end market color to provide in terms of our first quarter outlook. Do you have a follow-on, C.J.?","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. As a follow-up, in terms of the R&D guidance for the full year, can you discuss what to expected the linearity looks like?","Kevin P. March","C.J., I think -- it'll decline a little bit in the first half as we wind down the Wireless activity. We had some remaining commitments with Wireless customers that we'll have to continue to honor during the first half as we wind that down. And I expect, by the middle of the year, it will probably reach its run rate.","Operator","We'll now go to Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Kevin, just a clarification to make sure I heard it right. Did you say that OpEx would basically be flat sequentially because the cost savings are offsetting the usual seasonality?","Kevin P. March","We do expect OpEx to increase a bit, but it will largely be offset by the savings from the Wireless restructuring that we announced. But it won't be completely offset.","Ron Slaymaker","One more, Ross?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure, just looking on the embedded businesses, that's now obviously one of your core businesses. The operating margin in that is seen to have been depressed for 2 years running, even though flat revenue seemed to be what you guys could deliver. Can you talk about is that more of a gross margin or an OpEx-driven phenomenon? And what sort of growth expectations do you have to get the operating margin in that segment back to kind of a historical TI level or a peer group average?","Kevin P. March","Ross, in the Embedded Processing, your observation is accurate. It has been operating at -- operating profit levels below what we have in mind for that business. You may recall that about 1.5 years ago, we stepped up pretty significantly the amount of resources that we were putting into that business, particularly on the microcontroller side as it relates to our field applications engineers and other activities to support the growth in that product portfolio. In the meantime, of course, we've seen some of our stronger markets in the Embedded Processing space, namely the communications infrastructure, being weak for the past year, as well as catalog being somewhat weak in this generally slow macroeconomy. So between the weakness in our 2 larger markets and the fact that we stepped up the investment 1.5 year plus ago, those are combined, it would cause the operating margins to be at levels lower than we would prefer to have them operating at. So really going forward, this is all about getting the revenue line back into a growth mode to absorb the cost structure that's in place in that division today.","Operator","We'll now go to Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, can you just talk about inventory trends, what you expect the disti [distribution] to do in terms of inventory? And then also what do you guys expect to do in terms of your own utilization rates and inventory?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, I'll talk about distribution and I'll let Kevin talk about TI. Again, Chris, let me maybe even add some color to what happened last quarter because that will foretell a little bit about what we should see partly going forward. So if you'll note, we said distribution inventory fell by just over 0.5 week last quarter, ending up at a little under 6 weeks. About 1\/3 of that decline is due to the conversion of SVA over to an inventory consignment program at distribution. And so with that still in the early stages, you'll see a few more days of inventory impact over the next couple of quarters associated with that SVA consignment conversion. And again, that would have the effect of lowering each quarter maybe a couple of days disti inventory. And again, that could be overwhelmed by distributors choosing to start replenishing inventory as they prepare for a stronger market environment should they choose to. But that will be the one event that we can't foretell. Kevin, do you want to talk about TI inventory?","Kevin P. March","Yes. Actually, the point that Ron just made about that change in SVA certainly results in net inventory revenue being -- distributors' books winds up being on our books. Our days of inventory were up a couple days in the quarter to 103. Clearly, well within the ranges where we want to carry it out. As we go forward, we'll continue to carry inventory levels similar to what you've seen us carry this past year, 100, 100-plus days as we become more and more Analog and Embedded Processing focused. And if you take a look at most of our competitors, I think you'll find in the recent quarters, the average are between 90 and 130 days of inventories. And you should expect to see us carrying inventory days quite a bit higher than you might have thought about, let's say, 5 years ago. From a utilization standpoint, I think you asked the question on that, Chris. Utilization was down in the quarter, and we had an underutilization charge in the quarter of about $170 million. That compares to about $146 million in the last quarter. We aren't -- we don't have a forecast for where that goes going forward. But keep in mind that production tends to lead expected shipments and typically, we'd see second quarter up seasonally. So we would be sure to be staging inventory in anticipation of a normal seasonal 2Q.","Ron Slaymaker","So maybe if I can just add a little more color. Part of the reason we will carry more inventory as Analog and Embedded grow as a percentage of our revenue is that a high percentage of those products are long-lived catalog devices. They tend to be off the shelf. You tend to carry more inventory on those. And by the way, because of the long-lived nature of them, that inventory has much lower risk of obsolescence than, say, the type of custom products or very high volume products that went to very few customers. That would be represented, for example, in areas like Wireless. So as that mix changes, we become more catalog oriented in terms of the product profile by nature our product -- our inventory will trend up compared to our history. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, just a quick one. Can you give us sort of what your core business is doing sort of this quarter, normal seasonality? Can you just go into what you think we should be looking at, assuming we get back to normal -- what we should think of as normal seasonality for TI in Q2, 3 and 4? And then also, what would be the impact of the Wireless business going away on top of that seasonality?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Sure, Chris, and I will -- I'm going to start by giving you average 5 years seasonality unadjusted for any outlier years. You can do whatever you want on that. And this already comprehends no Wireless, and it does comprehend SVA as part of TI. So it really is reflective of, I think, the product lines that you are interested in. So first quarter, that 5-year average is minus 3% sequentially. Second quarter is up 9%. And don't forget that second quarter also has probably a couple of points impact at the company level associated with back-to-school seasonality for our calculator product line. Third quarter, sequential average is 5%. And then fourth quarter is down 11%. And similarly, third to fourth has the back-to-school negative transition associated with calculators. So of that down 11%, probably 3 of those points come directly from the calculator product lines. So I guess, all I can say in terms -- that gives you the seasonal pattern adjusted for Wireless. Now of course, this year overriding that, you're going to have a decline in the Wireless revenue. I don't have a profile quarter-by-quarter of what that decline will look like, Chris, other than generally we would expect, as I said previously, that by the end of 2013, that revenue is essentially gone. Baseband will be, I think, the numbers we gave you would put it down sub 1% of TI revenue in the first quarter. Of course, OMAP and the connectivity lines are larger than that, but we would expect that they would be essentially gone by the time we close out 2013.","Operator","We'll now go to John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my first question, Kevin, on gross margins. How much did royalty help the December quarter? And as I look into March, I'm trying to reconcile much better mix, probably less of an underutilization charge with gross margins. And maybe I'm just doing my math wrong relative to the midpoint of your guide, that I can't get much above 47.5% to maybe high 47%. Can you help me reconcile that, please?","Kevin P. March","Yes, John. On the gross margins, the royalty in the quarter was about $60 million. Going forward, we expect that's probably going to be about $160 million for the year, give or take a little bit. On the gross margin outlook, I think you're asking about it in your model, keep in mind that I did mention our underutilization charge was up this quarter, as we took our utilization down. But even as we readjust the factories in anticipation of a seasonal up second quarter, average use of utilization across 2 quarters really won't change that much. So we wouldn't expect our underutilization charge to really change much, 4Q to 1Q. I'm not sure what else you have in your model, but that maybe -- and maybe that helps explain where you're getting to.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, that is helpful. And I guess, Ron, as my follow-up, when you look at the $180 million left in the Wireless in the March quarter, how much of that is -- well, would you use -- argue as core versus non-core? And had that stayed as a separate bucket, what kind of operating loss should we have expected at that kind of revenue level?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. John, probably, the best I can give you is that if you look at last year, we had -- for the total segment, we had roughly $1.35 billion, $1.36 billion of revenue. About $150 million of that, that was in the Wireless segment, will move over into the Embedded Processing segment. So I think that's what you're calling core there. There are also, just to clarify, there was some OMAP revenue already in the Embedded Processing segment that was addressing automotive, but the amount that was inside of the Wireless segment was about $150 million. I think that ratio is probably pretty consistent with where we were at the end of the year in fourth quarter. So probably, if you use that as a rough starting point for transitioning into first quarter, you would get about the right number. I think we've said that the $135 million decline, I know when I look at just on a percentage basis, what that represented for the Wireless segment was about true for baseband also, meaning, I think that translates to a little over 40% sequential decline in the Wireless segment revenue. It was about that same amount for baseband. So therefore, for OMAP and connectivity, it would also be about that same amount in terms of the mobile side of those product lines. I guess that was your follow-on, John.","Operator","We'll now go with Glen Yeung from Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you're thinking about the products that are related to Wireless, for example, you may cross-sell Analog when you're selling Wireless products, have those products sort of followed your expectations now that Wireless is falling off? Are they sort of moving along the lines you would have expected or better or worse?","Ron Slaymaker","I think at this point, Glen, they're probably moving independent of the Wireless actions I guess I would say, which is generally what we would expect. And I think we've talked before even on the conference call that clearly, you can put together a more negative scenario that says yes, but OMAP Connectivity probably pulls along Analog revenue. I would argue that I think our experience has been we have to win those Analog sockets or those Analog opportunities case by case, and there really is not that much of a direct tie to the OMAP and Connectivity business. And then I think we could even put together a more, what I'll call bullish scenario that says a lot of our historical applications processor competitors, we would like to engage with them on their reference designs for Power Management products. But because we were a direct application processor competitor, I suspect there was some hesitancy to engage with TI on the reference design on some of these Analog Power Management opportunities. And we have a great capability in Power Management and Integrated Power Management to align with their product portfolios, and I suspect you'll find that some of those doors open as we're no longer competing directly with them in the application processor space. So again, those are different scenarios that could develop. But I would say, to date, we're not seeing necessarily upside. We're not seeing things ticking down as a result of our Wireless. I think we're seeing things move independent, which probably is roughly as we would expect. Do you have a follow-on, Glen?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I do. With respect now to maybe a bigger picture question on the cycle -- it sort of comes in 2 parts. One is you're talking about a seasonal second quarter and at the same time, you're saying visibility is relatively low. So I wonder if you can just address that issue. And maybe you can put that in the context of the overall cycle and comparing and contrasting what we're seeing today versus what we may have seen in the past in terms of the way cycles play themselves out.","Ron Slaymaker","Glen, let me just clarify. We have not described our second quarter expectations as seasonal. All I did previously was give the average seasonality, that 5-year average for each of the quarters of the year. We did describe our expectations at the middle of the guidance range for the non-Wireless revenue. Basically, it computes to a down 2%, which we described as seasonal. But we're not trying to, at this point, make any commentary about our expectations for the second quarter.","Operator","We'll now go to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First one, can you talk about utilization in your RFAB and other fabs? I think, Kevin, you had mentioned about $170 million or so in underutilization charges. Is there a cash versus noncash component on these charges?","Kevin P. March","Vivek, we won't -- I won't go into specific details by factory as to utilization because they fluctuate pretty much every week, every month, every quarter. But I did mention there was $170 million of underutilization charges. And roughly half of that is noncash, half of it, cash, give or take a few million in each side of that.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. If I were to look at just your profitability, I think in the past, you had set a business model of 55% gross margins and 30% operating margins, if memory serves me right. Now that you were exiting the Wireless segment, how should we think about TI's new business model or operating model once the demand environment normalizes?","Kevin P. March","Vivek, I think, you should think about it as Analog becomes a bigger portion, Analog and Embedded Processing become an ever bigger portion. You should see more of what we've seen in the past, and that is our ability to generate very, very healthy levels of free cash flow. The result of us being more focused in that area is that our CapEx bill, our capital expenditures bill, will be quite low in part because we have already invested at a very low cost and a lot of capacity. And in part because as Analog and Embedded Processing become a bigger portion of our revenue, they actually can use older factories for a longer period of time, and so they'll require less capital renewal. In addition, the R&D bill is more manageable in those spaces versus where we've been, especially in Wireless. And so that will free up cash as well. So as we move forward, I think you should be thinking about us as being able to not only continue to generate the kinds of healthy free cash flow that we have in years past, but probably even improving going forward, which frankly is good news for our shareholders because as they've seen us do for many years now, we tend to return the overwhelming majority of that free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends, and I expect that we will continue to do so going forward.","Operator","We'll now go to Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sort of a couple of big picture questions. First, excluding the Wireless wind-down, so if we just focus on your core business. Can you give us kind of the big picture puts and takes of why you might see any different cyclical trends than any of your competitors? In other words, as we hear your competitors potentially start to talk more bullishly about the cycle, is there any reason to think that you wouldn't see the same?","Ron Slaymaker","Jim, I suspect very little difference. I mean of course, you have to look at those different competitors and consider how their market exposure compares with TI. I mean, of course, somebody that's highly PC focused is going to have a different dynamic than what TI would. Similarly, somebody that has just a very, very high exposure to industrial might have a different exposure than what -- or with different profile than what TI would with our more broad exposure. But I think what we often find as we go through this process, and you've probably observed is that in the end, we all probably tend to see the same thing, the same market dynamics, with varying pressures as I just described. But coming into the quarter, maybe different levels of just subjective impact on those various guidance going forward. Do you have a follow on, Jim?","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, and I guess I'll stay on that topic for my follow-up. I mean, the reason I really asked the question is because maybe it's just a tone issue or kind of semantics, but relative to a couple of the other companies that have reported and talked about the industry, you guys don't sound quite as upbeat. And again, to your previous answer, I would have expected pretty similar tone and I'm just trying to gauge if there's anything significantly different driving that.","Kevin P. March","Jim, I would just talk that we're respectful of the actual order pattern that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, the book-to-bill of 0.96 in 3Q and 0.91 in 4Q, overall orders declining 16% quarter-over-quarter. That caused us to be respectful as to what the outlook might hold. But while we tempered that a bit, as Ron has indicated earlier in the call, that despite declining sales and revenues, recent 3 months, the fourth quarter, we have seen a turn in that direction in January. And January, certainly, so far is shaping up stronger than what December did. And so for that reason, we're putting our outlook out there and saying we're probably going to be kind of seasonal on the non-Wireless portion of our portfolio.","Operator","We'll now go to Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, for the next quarter's guidance, the Wireless business looks like it's falling off maybe -- am I doing my math right, $135 million would be 65% to 70% of kind of the total business that you have that's actually going away over the next year. But it doesn't look like the OpEx is falling off nearly that much yet. So I guess the question there is, number one, is that math correct? You're having actually a very big -- it sounds like a very big step down, is it on that magnitude? But is the OpEx fall off actually less than you've actually seen the revenue fall off for that business? And then what is the OpEx trend in terms of capturing that $450 million in savings look like through the year? When do we actually have it all in?","Ron Slaymaker","I'll let Kevin discuss the OpEx. But you were talking about -- I may be wrong. But again, what we said was the $317 million in our Wireless segment, that will be down $135 million, which would be about 43%. And Stacy, I totally realize, you may be trying to take a subset of that Wireless segment that ties just to the products that are going away, so...","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's right, that's right.","Ron Slaymaker","And I'm not saying that's not wrong. I'm just reiterating what we said. Kevin, do you want to comment on OpEx savings?","Kevin P. March","Yes, on the OpEx, we expect to see that savings feather its way in to the P&L over the course of 2013. We saw a little bit in the fourth quarter, probably something in the $10 million range, probably get another $30 million to $40 million or so as we move into the first quarter and continue at that kind of pace until we get to the end of the year. We talked about that by the time we get to the end of the year, on an annualized basis, we should see about $450 million from the costs coming out of the -- most of the OpEx line.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So it is there to --  go ahead, sorry.","Ron Slaymaker","I was just going to add, Stacy, I think in the first quarter, you have -- you're going to have 2 factors. One is we are exiting these product lines. And the other is just seasonality with some of these wireless customers, which tends to be pretty significant in the fourth to first transition. Go ahead. Do you have a follow on?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","No, I was just going to -- I guess just as a follow-up on that, is it fair to say then that the hit for the Wireless business in Q1 as a percentage of the stuff should be going away, you're losing more of that revenue in Q1 than you're losing the OpEx. Is that a correct way to think about this?","Kevin P. March","I think maybe that when you think about that as the GPM that we're losing on that revenue, is probably falling away at about the same pace as the OpEx. That may be a better way to think about it. And so what the result is, is that, that division by itself, profitability isn't going to be noticeably different than what we just came through until we get the benefit of the rest of the wind-down of the OpEx on that in the balance of the year.","Ron Slaymaker","And they'll accelerate probably as we move through...","Kevin P. March","Move through the year.","Operator","And we'll go to Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder -- if you go back to the analyst meeting earlier in 2012, you talked about the trend line analysis and looked at the sort of we were 19% and [indiscernible] below the trend line and talk about the potential for catching up. And obviously, the weaker macro disrupted that. I believe there was that potential there and it didn't play out. How do you think about that now? How you think about 2013? Are we still below our trend line? Do you think that there's a catch-up and what can drive that to happen?","Kevin P. March","Well, I would say that history -- as soon as you deny the history, you usually wind up finding yourself in trouble. But the history has taught us that we do tend to go back to trend line. It is a little unusual, as you pointed out, Joe, that we haven't made that move back yet. But I would simply say that I wouldn't try challenging the history. I'd say it's probably going to come to pass at some point, a little difficult to call when. What's more important is that operationally, we intend to be ready for it. And by that, what I mean is, we intend to have ample capacity when it comes back. And we intend to do have ample inventory on hand, so that we're able to respond our customers when they do start seeing their normal demand trends occur when they come back toward that trend line.","Ron Slaymaker","And Joe, what I think is really cool about TI's position is we're not sitting here betting our company or betting our future on a particular forecast. We've bought capacity when it was cheap and when it was available and we are in position to support pretty much any kind of upturn profile you can envision over the next year or so. And if it takes a while longer, so be it. We're -- it's fully in the numbers. If it wants to run hard and fast, we're ready to go. So we don't need to go significantly change our capital spending profile to get there. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. The state of the end customer inventories at this point, it seems like that's been lean for several quarters. You had a fair amount of inventory on your books, the distribution channel had enough, and it feels like the customer just hasn't needed to restock. Do you think that dynamic stays in place? Or is there a catalyst that can get a restocking phase to start?","Kevin P. March","Joe, I think that as soon as consumers feel a little bit more confident, have a little bit more sense of certainty as to where things are going, they will probably return to a more normal behavior, which means they won't be continually relying on us being able to ship to them inside the lead times. I think that customers generally perceive that as being a somewhat risky strategy, if in fact, their demand should return. And the big issue, I think, is just waiting for some of the uncertainty to clear up. Certainly, the macro events over the last year have compounded that with the Euro headlines, with the China slowdown, although it does sound like it maybe is beginning to turn a bit on that front. And here in the U.S., of course, the fiscal cliff. We've only had one part of that dealt with so far, and it appears we've got more of that. When some of that stuff gets behind us, I expect our customers will probably go the back to carrying inventory levels that -- where they control their destiny a bit more better than relying on suppliers to be able to ship inside of lead time.","Ron Slaymaker","Yes, and certainly, as you said before, any other outcome would be a big bet against history, which tends to repeat itself here.","Operator","And we'll now go to Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Guys, on the Silicon Valley Analog, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems you are a quarter ahead of what you promised us in terms of getting that business in sync with the rest of the Analog. And if so, is it too early to call that turn? Or do you expect to see that pattern in the following quarters? And I have a follow-up, Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, I'll add a little. And then, Kevin, if you want to go with it, can as well. I would not describe it as a quarter ahead. Just if you'll recall, we said in the first year, we expect that the -- we expected that -- let me back up. The first year post-acquisitions, which really ended in third quarter of 2012, we expected that it would continue losing market share, which is a trend that had been on. In the second year, we expected that it would become I would call it market neutral, meaning the market share losses would stop. But it would probably still be lagging TI's overall Analog performance since we have a much stronger history over multiple years of share gains. We really did not expect and do not expect SVA to really start having a strong track record of share gains consistent with the rest of TI Analog until the third year. I shouldn't say we do not expect that. I should say that, that was what we had built into our initial assumptions and modeling pre-acquisition. So as you noted from our comments, we have a quarter here where it performed consistent with the rest of TI Analog, even despite a pretty strong headwind of that consignment conversion in the fourth quarter. But, Ambrish, I would say that is 1 quarter. And even though we found that performance encouraging, by no means are we going to declare success. It's an encouraging sign. But we need to see 4 of those quarters strung together before we start declaring anything for the year. And do you have anything else than that? Okay, do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. Just moving over to the Embedded side. Could you please refresh our memory, how big is the Comm infrastructure within that segment? And then where are we from the peak level? And if I remember correctly, the gross margin from a normalized level around is about 100 bps higher, 100 to 500 bps higher than the 55% level?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. I'll comment on the revenue mix there and then Kevin, if you have any comments on relative margins. So -- and compared to where we were. So if you just take the year overall, let me just break out the Embedded Processing revenue for you. Catalog was 55% of the revenue mix, and that's the same as it was in 2011. Comms infrastructure was 25% of our Embedded Processing revenue, and that's down about 5 points from where it was in 2011. It was 30% of the mix that year. And then automotive was 20% of our Embedded Processing revenue last year, and that's up from 15%. So that mix is really driven by the disproportionate strength -- and I'm sorry, weakness in the communications infrastructure market last year, combined with the fact that TI has really high market share in that comms infrastructure market. It's a market we think is going to have just really good secular trends in the years ahead. So even though it hurt us a bit in terms of Embedded Processing share last year, we won't forego our position by any means nor make apologies there. And similarly, automotive, just the market was good last year. And TI has a, what I will describe as a building position in automotive. Kevin, do you comments then on the profitability?","Kevin P. March","Yes. As you know, Ambrish, we don't actually report gross margin details of the businesses. But at a high level, if you think about how these businesses run, Embedded Processing really has 3 components that we talked about. The catalog components that are inside there, that tends to be similar to an HPA, SVA kind of business model. And you're going to see margins -- gross margins, probably north of 60%. On the other side, you've got automotive products. And that includes some legacy products that we have in that portfolio. And you will probably see those margin somewhere closer to the 50% level. And then comms infrastructure will tend to run in between the 2 of those over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shawn Webster from Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","On the Analog, you talked -- you've already talked a bit about the Silicon Valley Analog. I was wondering if you could share with us some of the dynamics happening in the other segments. It looks like for the year or at least on a year-over-year basis, the High Volume Logic and the Power Management were relatively stronger than the High Performance. I was wondering if you could give us some color either on market share or market dynamics there.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay.  Shawn, let me just -- and most of these will be with respect to the fourth quarter as opposed to necessarily for the full year. But I would say that the HPA decline really was pretty broad-based. So I don't know that I can pull out a particular market or product area. HPA, not quite as much as -- or HPA and SVA, I would say, combined, they have a common characteristic of being more catalog oriented, moving through distribution. They probably have higher industrial exposure than what some of the other 2 areas would have, so potentially that could come in as well. HVAL, I would say, we saw some impact from a few areas. One is the HDD market being weak. The other consideration in the fourth quarter was consumer seasonality basically backing down off of what would typically be a stronger third quarter. And then also in the fourth quarter, we saw automotive being a bit weaker. If you look at the Power Management area, sequential trend there was really driven -- again, I'd say pretty broad-based, but the biggest areas that I would kind of just say were most notable would be declines in notebooks, digital television and then also to a lesser degree, handset. Okay. Do you have a follow-on, Shawn?","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Yes. Just a housekeeping on the tax side of things. So you have a tax benefit in Q1 and you have full year guidance for -- of 22%. Does the 22% include the benefit you'd get in Q1?","Kevin P. March","No, it does not. The benefit in Q1 is a discrete benefit that will be spiked out by itself. It's about $65 million or about $0.06 of EPS. The 22% is the effective tax rate excluding that benefit, so that's the ongoing rate for the year. However, I would note that, that rate does include now the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2013.","Ron Slaymaker","So Shawn, just a kind of hint then when you're looking at your first quarter tax rate in terms of your model, plan on 22%, and then on top of that, add in the $65 million benefit. But if you just look at normal PDT and all that, apply a 22% tax rate and then on top of that, add in the $65 billion -- I'm sorry, $65 million discrete tax benefit. That does not spread across the year or anything like that. So kind of the ongoing rate will be that 22% rate.","Operator","We'll go to Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, so my first question, you talked about disti resales being down 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter. What were TI's sales to disti in the quarter?","Ron Slaymaker","Kevin is looking. I don't know off the top of my head.","Kevin P. March","Our resales were down a little bit also. Actually, their resales were down a bit, but our sales to them were down a little bit as well, with their inventory declining as we mentioned by a couple days to less than 6 weeks.","Ron Slaymaker","Yes. So again, inventory decline, we shipped in less than they shipped out. But that doesn't necessarily change the growth rate. But anyway, down a little bit as well. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. My follow-on is I know you can't comment really on bookings by end market so far this quarter. But could you comment on maybe by region? Or is this very broad-based, whether it's OEM or disti?","Ron Slaymaker","In terms of the January trends, Tore?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Correct, yes.","Ron Slaymaker","Yes, I don't have a regional breakout. I can offer you a consolation prize and talk about what happened regionally last quarter since we haven't discussed that. But I don't have the month-to-date data by region. In this last quarter, this is a pretty weak consolation prize I'll admit, because it's revenue as opposed to bookings. But in the fourth quarter, we had all regions down, with Asia being down the most. And that would be followed then by the U.S. as well. From there, Europe and Japan. Okay. Sorry, we didn't have that detail for you, Tore.","And with that, we're going to close off the call. Before we end, let me remind you that a replay of this call is available on our website.

Please go ahead.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.","For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8%, while embedded processing revenue grew 8%. ","Earnings per share were $0.65.","With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.","In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.","We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.","Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume, analog and logic. Power management and high-performance analog also declined, while Silicon Valley analog grew.","Embedded processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by processors. Our investments in embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record.","In our other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products.","Compared with a year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to lower demand and personal electronics that I described earlier. Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4-1\/2 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which, together, drive high customer service metric. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program.","Now provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end-market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained very strong driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly with most sectors growing.","Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall personal electronics was down more than that, primarily due to mobile phones.","Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth.","Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.","Kevin March","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone.","Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion and was 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products.","Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year-ago period. Over the last 12 months we've invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.","Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions.","Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.","Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we staged our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also included were three to four days of inventory associated with a portion of the personal electronics market that started to flow late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year.","Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter.","On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only for this return to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.","In the first quarter we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to produce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments with our US entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses.","Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago.","Turning to our outlook, for the second quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter to the third quarter of 2019. They'll then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.","So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up.","Erica [ph]?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We'll go first to the line of Romit Shah. Please go ahead.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Yes, thank you, and excellent results. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's driving the revenues in Q2 by end-market?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, Romit. We don't typically provide a forecast by end-market. However, if there's any large shifts, we'll talk about that, you know, much like we did last quarter within a sector in personal electronics. I can say that that demand we would expect to grow sequentially, but it will be down significantly from a year ago. And I'd also say that, outside of that, we would expect the rest of our business to grow both sequentially and year over year.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Okay. And yeah, just -- yeah, I know that the conversation to 300-millimeter has been an important part of the improvement in margin profile, and I was wondering if you could just update us on how much of the portfolio is converted to 300 and how much is left.","Kevin March","Romit, I'll go ahead and talk to that. Roughly a quarter of our analog revenue was generated on 300 millimeter last year. We have total internal capability about $8 billion, so we're using about a quarter of that capability at this point in time.","Just to remind everyone else who's listening, the reason the 300 millimeter is so important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3 times as many chips per wafer on a 300 millimeter versus the 200 millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4 times as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual die cost is only about 60% as much on a 300 millimeter as a 200 millimeter wafer.","When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal we wind up with a higher gross margin on those chips to manufacture 300 millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us.","As we look out in the future, again we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300 millimeter and we continue to increase our loadings in that space. In fact on a year-over-year basis we actually had more starts on 300 millimeter than a year ago.","Dave Pahl","Good. And I'll just add to Kevin's comment, that as we reported last quarter, we qualified our second 300 millimeter fab, which is DMOS 6, and we do have product running in that fab today. So, thank you, Romit. We'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","I'll take our next question from the line of John Pitzer. Please go ahead, your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yeah, good afternoon guys. Solid execution as always.","I guess, could you talk a little bit about the embedded processing op margin improvements? If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the wireless business, you didn't get out of all the costs and you put a lot of that cost into the embedded processing market. If I look at sort of the incremental margin, op margin sequentially, it's greater than 60%. Are we sort of at a tipping point here with that kind of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this business? And is there any reason why the embedded op margin shouldn't converge with the analog op margins over time?","Kevin March","Yeah, John. You might recall was for the year ago we were still in the process of winding up some restructuring items in the embedded processing segment. That finished about the middle of the second quarter, that bled over into the middle of the second quarter. [Inaudible] now we're seeing the benefit of those cost restructurings.","The margin improvement that we'll see [inaudible] solid 25% operating profit a quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about, quarter over quarter, about a 62% pull-through [ph] to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue. So that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward.","I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same sort of levels as analog, but we are confident there remains room of improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and a drive towards revenue growth.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","You mentioned, as my follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the inventory growth you saw in the March quarter. Just kind of curious how long it takes to get back closer to trend, as you exit June, would you expect to see days closer to your trend line, or how should we think about that?","Kevin March","Yeah. I think what's actually interesting, John, is our dollars of inventory are actually down year over year. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days of inventory were up, and that's up on the expectation of increased shipments in the second quarter. And plus there's a few extra days that are inside that 1Q inventory as a result of the slowdown in personal electronics that we mentioned 90 days ago.","We expect that material is going to ship over the balance of the year. And between the increased shipments in 2Q and the shipments of that personal electronics material, we'll see the days of inventory drift back down comfortably inside our model, very similar to what we saw last year. If you go back and take a look last year, we were also a little bit higher in the first quarter, anticipation of second quarter growth, and then days drifted down as we came through the year.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Participant","Hi. This is Charles [ph] on for Toshiya. Your Q2 guide at the midpoint, flat to down year-over-year growth, I was kind of wondering when you expect to kind of return to growth and what the drivers of that will be.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. So I think if you look at the midpoint, you're right, the year-over-year growth would be down about 1%. As we talked about before, we, on a year-over-year basis, we'll still have the growth impacted due to the weakness inside of personal electronics. Outside of that, we expect to see our businesses growing both sequentially and year on year, and again I think that we're on a good position to capitalize on the trends of industrial and automotive. We think longer term that that's where the growth in our industry will come from. And just as a reminder, we had last year about 46% of our revenues driven by there. So we feel good with where our products are positioned.","Unidentified Participant","Got it. And then gross margin performance was strong, if you want. Outside of lower depreciation and incremental 300 millimeter revenues, where are the other factors that are going to drive upside from here?","Kevin March","Well, you hit two important ones. So we have lower manufacturing costs year over year, driven by, as you mentioned, lower depreciation and increased 300 millimeter wafer starts. But we also had a retromix of overall products. As Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, industrial was up very solidly for us, and in the industrial space we enjoy a very nice mix of overall profitability. So you have that combination of events going on.","And again, to Dave's comments a moment ago, as we continue to see content growth in industrial and automotive, we would expect to continue to see an improvement on our mix from a profitability standpoint too as we look out over the quarters and years. So it's all coming together very nicely for us right now.","Dave Pahl","Okay, great. Thank you. And we'll go to our next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon. Please go ahead.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","In the quarter, OpEx came in a little higher. I was wondering if you could tell us the driver, what drove that, and what your thoughts are for OpEx for Q2.","Kevin March","Yes, Stacy, OpEx did come in a little bit higher than what we had planned for. There really wasn't any one thing that drove that. There's just a number of small things that were being taken care of in the quarter.","As we look into second quarter, recall that 1Q includes about two months' worth of our annual pay and benefit increases. If you look into 2Q you'll need to account for that, that we would have the full three months of pay and benefit increases. I'd expect the change quarter to quarter to be very similar to what you saw last year.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Got it. Thank you, that's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the comm infrastructure impact on both embedded processing as well as others. So, embedded dropped 8% year over year. You noted within your other business that your ASIC, custom ASICs, are down year over year. I think both of those tend to be driven very highly by comm infrastructure. Can you help us understand the differential between those two businesses? Is one of them eating the other for example?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. So, first, let me talk about our embedded business. So, our embedded business, as you remember, has three product lines inside of it. Micro-controllers and processors are both about 45% of that revenue, and connectivity makes up about 10% of that revenue. So we saw growth in all three of those businesses, they all grew very nicely. But it was led by processors.","So our communications infrastructure, processors would be inside of that business, but we also sell automotive products that are inside of that business that drove that growth.","The -- in the other business, the custom ASIC business, I'll just say that we saw a different mix of products to customers, so it's not always the same. We've got some customers where we only sell both embedded and analog into those customers. So -- and that said, this is a reminder longer term, we do expect that the custom ASIC business will decline, because that functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs inside of the embedded business, so. Thank you --","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you guys.","Dave Pahl","-- Stacy. We'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis. Please go ahead.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just talk about the outperformance in gross margin? You said 300 millimeters. I was just curious what the utilization rates are. And as you look into Q2, it seems that guidance implies kind of sustaining at that level. I just want to make sure that was right and what you're expecting to do with utilizations there.","Kevin March","Yeah, the utilizations actually haven't changed that much in a number of quarters and we don't expect it to change much in the next quarter or two either. The amount of wafers that we're starting are pretty consistent as we go across the quarters. And Blayne, you can kind of see that in -- when our days of inventory is up in 1Q, we're building for increased shipments in 2Q that allows us to run the factories at pretty close to similar utilizations quarter over quarter, rather than ramping them up and down to meet in-quarter demand. So I wouldn't expect utilization to change that much going into the next couple of quarters just as it hasn't in the last number of quarters.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital","Got you. And then just my follow-up, you had a correction in consumer as you pointed out. As you look into the back half of the year, you said you expected to sell through. So do you expect your content in those types of [ph] applications to be roughly similar this year and therefore you should see a similar ramp like you did last year?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, we haven't given color on how much content we have. I'll just say that, when we do engage where we like to be able to engage inside of personal electronics, those types of products that we'll sell across multiple generations of products, and that's not always the case on every product that we make an investment in, but that's where we want to steer our investment dollars. So we're confident that, as we build that inventory, that we'll have demand in the back half. We won't try to predict at this point what that demand will look like, so.","Thank you, Blayne, and good to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the site of Harlan Sur. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Another solid showing by the embedded business. You pointed out particular strength in processors, I think you guys talked about comms as a driver there, and maybe some automotive. But your MCU products also grew nicely year over year. Maybe you can just give us some insights on the end-market\/applications that drove the growth in that sub-segment.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. You know, our MCU business is really a great business that we're building. And as you know, we've been investing in that business for some time. We've got and continued to invest both in TI-based architectures as well as ARM-based architectures, and we've got customers that want to have both of those. And we continue to be selective on where we make those investments.","Part of the, you know, the way that you differentiate those products is by having peripherals that are optimized for different types of applications. We developed micro-controllers that are targeted for ultra-low-power battery-backed operations that'll be in-fielded for, in some cases, decades, as well as very high-performance-based microcontrollers, so. And we've got very strong connectivity solutions, both wired, but as well as wireless. And that crosses over into our connectivity business that we've got there and that we support over a dozen different interface or wireless standards inside of that business.","So, again, very, very broad-based, and we really are encouraged by the results of that business.","You have a follow-on, Harlan?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Yeah. But in the industrial markets, which was obviously an area of strength for you guys in the March quarter, you guys have talked previously about servicing like I think 14 different sub-segments, so, very broad.","Dave Pahl","You're correct.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","You've also talked about content gains in industrial, which is kind of a similar dynamic to the automotive segment. Any of those sub-segments within industrial that are showing more of a bias towards more dollar content gains on a go-forward basis?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, I think, Harlan, the one nice thing about automotive is we can more easily identify what unit SAR growth is and there's enough analysts that follow that market that we can track with the semiconductor content gain. And there we think that there's probably somewhere around $350 on average that sells into an automotive. That's a number that's been growing very nicely.","When I look at that, that's probably about 1% of the average sales price of a car, so it's not too hard to imagine that that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the future. When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were three, five years ago in the automotive market with industrial, you really can't do that same type of analysis, unfortunately, because we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that there are literally hundreds of different end equipment that we track and develop solutions for. And there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going on.","And the beauty of it is it's not just one thing. It really is a growth on a very broad basis. And I think that that's reflected in our numbers, not only this quarter but it's been reflected in the numbers for a number of quarters now. So we really look forward to that opportunity in the future.","Okay, Harlan. Thank you. And we'll move on to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. One more on gross margins. Is the 60.6% the new baseline and we should model the flow-through from this level, or are there any mix benefits that are helping you in the first half that might reverse when the smartphone shipments start to ramp in the second half?","Kevin March","Well, you'll have several things going on across that. That's a pretty tough call to make and more time to get too precise.","We would expect industrial and automotive to continue to be a growing portion of our revenue over time. That's where we're focusing our attention, especially R&D dollars. We also expect more starts, as we look out into the future, proportionately more starts on 300 millimeter, which is lower cost wafers. We would also expect the depreciation and declines that we've been seeing this past year to continue, albeit at a slower pace than what we've seen in the last few quarters. So those will give you tailwinds, so even if you do have some of these other products start back up, [inaudible] mix going on inside there that these margins that we're operating at right now are probably representative of what the portfolio can do for our shareholders.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. [Inaudible] Kevin. And as my follow-up, you mentioned that sales growth in Q1 plus what you're guiding to Q2, excluding, I don't recall whether you said personal electronics or just your largest customer, that sales growth is actually up year on year. Could you help us quantify what that growth trend is versus last year?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, Vivek, we're not being that precise. We just wanted to give some color generally that, you know, where we had that headwind and the demand changing late in the fourth quarter, that that portion of our demand inside of personal electronics, that we expect that it will grow sequentially but be down significantly year over year. And we just haven't gotten more precise than that, so.","Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll move on to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Please go ahead.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for letting me ask the question guys. I guess the first question would be, your first quarter came in at the high end of the range. Can you just talk about what was the positive surprise in the quarter? And maybe associated with that, Dave, I think in the past you have given sequential end-market performance to match what you've given and then year over year, if that helps to answer both questions, that will be great.","Dave Pahl","Yes. So again as we had said earlier, that portion of demand where we saw weakness came in about as we expected. The strength was more broad-based, and we continue to, obviously, to see strength in automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment. So, very, very broad-based strength that we saw.","So the second part of your question was sequentially. What we saw from the trends there, no surprise that automotive remained very strong, and it was driven by infotainment as well as the hybrid electric and powertrain systems. Industrial, again we had growth across almost every sector inside of industrial. Personal electronics down, with most sectors declining. And comms equipment was up sequentially, and that was the third quarter in a row that it actually grew. And then enterprise systems was up due to projectors.","So, did you have a follow-on, Ross?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, I'll make it quick. And you just talked about the comms side, the third quarter in a row it's been up. Generally, how do you think about that versus where we are after earning a ton of inventory and now coming back, are we to the point where we're shipping to end-demand and then now we can grow or shrink with that, or is there some other dynamics going on?","Dave Pahl","Can you repeat the first part of the question? Because you just cut out a little bit on our side.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Sure, I'm sorry. So you said your comms business was actually up for the third quarter in a row.","Dave Pahl","Right.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Obviously that had fallen due to the end-market before that.","Dave Pahl","Yeah.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","So the question is, do you think you're back to shipping to end-demand and what do you view to be the growth trajectory of that business longer term?","Dave Pahl","Yup. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I would say that, you know, that business, as you know, Ross, has always remained choppy, and we had a very strong period of growth going back a year ago, followed by declines that we saw last year. It's just, you know, it's really tough to be able to predict what's going to happen in that market. And we just positioned product and inventory to be able to respond if that demand will continue to strengthen. And if it doesn't, we know how to react in that environment too.","So it still continues to be a really good business for us. We continue to make investments in it. And we just know that it'll be choppy.","Longer term, we don't view it as a market that will be a growth. We don't think that operators will take their CapEx spending up over the next 5, 10, 15 years. But we do think that there will continue to be shifts in how they spend that money. So we continue to make investments where we believe that that growth will be in the future. So, thank you very much and we'll move to the next caller please.","Operator","Yes. We'll take our next question from the site of Chris Danley. Please go ahead.","Chris Danley - Citi","Hey. Thanks guys. I apologize if these questions have been asked before. I got on here late, I was listening to Zylex [ph] slamming my head against my desk.","It sounds like you're guiding for a roughly seasonal, slightly below seasonal environment. If you could just kind of compare now versus a quarter ago, versus a year ago or the last six months how you feel overall about the overall environment. Is it seasonal, a little below seasonal, better than seasonal, getting better, getting worse? Any comments there?","Dave Pahl","Well, I'd just make the observation that we believe we're just continuing to operate in a very similar macro-environment that we've seen in the last few quarters and even in the recent years. And our guidance obviously is our best estimate of how we'll perform. So we try to stay away from making any precise comments on what a seasonal quarter looks like. As you know, Chris, just -- because if you look at the numbers, there's usually a pretty wide variation on what an average would tell you that it would be.","So again, just very similar macro-environment to what we've seen.","You have a follow-up?","Chris Danley - Citi","Yeah. Real quick, just on channel inventory and distribution inventory. I think you said that channel inventory was up a couple of days, around 4-1\/2 weeks. Do you expect channel inventory or disti inventory to go up again in Q2? And then if you could just give us kind of the range that channel inventory\/disti inventory has been in for the last, call it, two or three years, is this basically the bottom or a little off the bottom or closer to the peak, or where would that be?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. Well, we've, as you know, we've, several years ago, implemented our consignment program, so I think we still continue to learn what the right level in that -- in the channel will be. And I'd just say that if we could actually convert all of our shipments and distributions to consignment and carry that inventory ourselves, we'd actually prefer to do that. So if anything, we'd encourage our distributors to take advantage of those programs.","We've operated I'd say around four weeks to 4-1\/2 weeks I think for some time. That number probably, you know, somewhere in that range, even if it drifted up a little bit, it always just depends on the products that's out there and the speed at which it turns. But we've got other peers that measure the inventory in months, and not weeks. So we're very, you know, efficient on how we use that channel. And it works out really well for both of us and our distributor partners. So we feel very good about where that level is overall. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please.","Chris Danley - Citi","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess, question from me, I think the lower depreciation helped you guys on the gross margins about 130 basis points year over year. Do you think that magnitude can sustain throughout calendar 2016 or should we think about depreciation dollars to be more of a flat [inaudible]?","Kevin March","I made a comment a few minutes ago that the rate of depreciation, decline, that we have seen over the past year is -- will slow down meaningfully as we go into 2016. Recall that, from a capital spending standpoint, our model is to spend about 4% of our revenues on CapEx, which we have been doing for the last couple of years, and we expect to continue this year. Our depreciation runs more than 4%, so clearly they'll have to converge at some point. Our depreciable life on most of our equipment is five years. And you may recall that it was about five years ago when we brought on several new factories, one in Izu [ph], some equipment to be brought in to our fab here in the Dallas area, and a factory we bought in China.","And so we're seeing those depreciation occurrence roll down now. So the rate of the decline that we saw over the last few quarters this past year will slow down, although it will still decline as we go into 2016.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And if I just follow up, I think you guys have about a billion dollars of debt that's due in the month of May. Is the thought process to just pay that off with cash on hand and roll it forward, and what would that implication have for your interest expense line as you go forward?","Kevin March","Well, if we pay it off, the interest expense will clearly decline. But I expect that we'll probably do what we've done similarly in the last couple of cycles on this where we have, if the interest rates are favorable by the time we go back into the market, we'll likely pay off a portion and roll the balance into a new issue. In either case, whether we pay off the entire amount or just pay off a portion, roll over the balance, I would expect interest cost will decline by several million dollars a quarter.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Please go ahead, Tore Svanberg, your line is open.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, thank you. So, Silicon Valley Analog was up year over year, and that -- I mean that's better than the industry, better than your peers. Was that mainly due to industrial and automotive strength or were there some shared gains, all the things going on there?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. Tore, SVA does have a good exposure to both industrial and automotive, and that certainly helped that business.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And as my follow-up for Kevin -- Kevin, do you have a CapEx number for us for this year or should we just take 4% of whatever revenue we come up with?","Kevin March","Well, keep it simple, just take 4% of your expected revenue number and you're going to be pretty close to what we're spending.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus","All right. Sounds good. Great job guys. Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Tore. We'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Ambrish Srivastava. Please go ahead.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the automotive business. Dave, we haven't talked about the momentum that you guys seem to be witnessing here. Big, sizable business, bigger than your peers, and year after year, just like the rest of the business, it's boring, but it grows. So the question I had was, where are the new opportunities that you guys are now designed if we were to look at where automotive to TI was, say, a couple of years ago? So, what should we be thinking over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Sure, Ambrish. Yeah. The automotive business that we're building continues to be very, very broad-based. So we've got strong participation in both analog as well as embedded. Inside of embedded we've got both processors and microcontrollers, as well as even some connectivity designs inside of that business.","From an analog standpoint, it actually is very, very broad-based. And one of the things that we've been focused on is broadening the number of business units that the company participates in automotive. And I think if you went back five, ten years ago, we might have had one or two business units participating in that marketplace. And today, out of our 70 or so different business units, I think over half of them actually ship products into that marketplace. So it's very, very broad-based.","We've got five what we call sectors that make up the automotive market. And again the largest one is not more than mid-single-digit as a percentage of our revenue last year. So they are -- the five segments are infotainment and cluster [inaudible] safety, advanced driver, assist systems or ADAS as it's known, body electronics which also includes lighting, and then the hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain.","So we've seen growth across all of those sectors, very, very robust growth and a very broad range [ph].","So you have a follow-on, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","No, that was it for me, Dave. Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Operator, we've got time for one more caller.","Operator","Okay. We will take our final question from the line of William Stein. Please go ahead, sir.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Dave, around the middle of last year I think was the first time you highlighted the potential for a 10% customer, and maybe we'd been sort of dancing around this point, but I wonder if you expect that that customer will repeat at a similar magnitude in this year.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. You know, that's a projection that I won't make on today's call. I think that they and all of our customers, we've got teams that work very, very hard to get products designed into. And with that largest customer, as we talked about before, we sell them hundreds of products, we participate in all of their major platforms. And of course the revenue would always be skewed where they ship their products, and I think they've publicly reported that about two-thirds of their revenues would be in phones. So our revenues will mirror those types of shipments.","So we've got good growth in automotive, we've got -- we're seeing strengthening and broad strengthening inside of industrial. And that's a trend we'll see, how those trends continue for the balance of the year. There's a lot of time between now and the end of the year. And then we'll see what happens inside of personal electronics as well, so.","You have a follow-on Will?","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah, one on capacity if I can. I'm wondering if you acquired any capacity as you do periodically and if there's any update on the planned fab closure in Scotland?","Kevin March","Yeah, William, I'll go ahead and answer that one. We have been -- we continue to acquire capacity. No new factories here lately, but we do continue to pick up equipment that was quite expensive new for pretty good prices when you buy them the way we buy them.","As it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland, as a reminder, we expect that factory will not close before the end of 2018, as it has been with other factories in the past, when we close those things, they either take a couple of years. As you slowly do lifetime builds on the inventory, and on certain other parts of those factories you'll recall other existing factories. And that's just a multiyear effort.","So it's progressing as plan and we again don't expect it to actually complete until about the end of 2018.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you very much, Will. And thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","We'd like to thank everybody for their participation. Please feel free to disconnect your line at any time.",""],"20464":["Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2017  5:30 PM ET","Executives","David Pahl - VP and Head of IR","Kevin March - SVP, CFO","Rafael Lizardi - Co-CFO","Analysts","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Chris Danely - Citigroup","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Romit Shah - Nomura","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments\u2019 4Q'16 and 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.","David Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '16 and 2016 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our Web site at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web, and can be accessed through our Web site. A replay will be available through the Web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from managements\u2019 current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. Also with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1st. Rafael joined TI in 2001, and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy of West Point, and Masters in Business of Administration from Stanford University.","As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown in average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We\u2019ve all benefitted and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI's shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael.","I don\u2019t want to get too sentimental, but as this is Kevin's final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI is clearly a better Company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael for the past decade, and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO.","With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that\u2019s important to calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8th at 10:00 AM Central time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael, will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks and Kevin and I will cover the rest.","Now, let's start with the quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year-ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continues. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year-ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.","In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02, and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. With that back-drop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TIs business model.","In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.","We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases.","Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter. Revenue increased due to power management, high-performance Analog, and Silicon Valley Analog. High-volume Analog in logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from the year ago quarter due to processors and micro-controllers. Connectivity also grew. In our other segment, revenues declined 9% from a year ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products. DLP products and calculators were about even.","For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI\u2019s revenue for the year. We\u2019ve recently simplified the product lines inside our two business segments, Analog and Embedded. To align by product categories, our customers think about. Making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial.","Analog is now comprised of three product lines instead of four. These are power, signal chain and high-volume Analog in logic. Embedded goes from three product lines to two. Connected MCU, which merges connectivity and micro-controllers and processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line levels. Nothing changes at the segment level. To help you understand this structure, for 2016 within our Analog business, power would have been about 45% of Analog revenue, signal chain would have been about 35% and high volume in Analog and logic would have been the remaining 20%.","Inside our embedded business, connected MCU would have been about 55% of embedded revenue with processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we\u2019ll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments.","Now, let me describe our performance by end-market for 2016. This is a reminder we annually provide an estimate of TI\u2019s revenue by end markets. We breakeven to six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators.","Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6% respectively, both year and to last year, while other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016.","For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we\u2019ve been highly focused on a strategy where we\u2019ve been allocating our capital and we\u2019ve been driving initiatives to increase our market share and industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they provide the diversity and longevity of products which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.","In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI\u2019s revenue, up from 44% just two years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied, and are continuing to make improvements, such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin March","Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.13 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased to 400 basis points. Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.","Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Restructuring charges and other was $20 million net benefit, which includes a gain related to intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter.","Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had total benefits of $228 million in the quarter. We recognize $188 million in other income and expense or OIE, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.","Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, one set tax benefit related to the new accounting standards for stock compensation, and $0.01 restructuring charge.","This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When employee stock compensations are exercised or when restricted stock units test, either in excess tax benefit or deficiency maybe generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in incomes taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. In the fourth quarter 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share and for the year a benefit of $0.13 per share. I\u2019ll also note that this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.","I\u2019ll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results.","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300 millimeter Analog capacity.","Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. And will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business, or returned to shareholders. Our intent overtime remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we received from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged.","In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividend, and repurchased $475 million of our stock for a total return of $974 million. Total cash return to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined return demonstrates our confidence in our business model, and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividend or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months, and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 51 consecutive quarters.","In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone, reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares, or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on-shore cash is readily available for multiple uses.","I will now turn it back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks.","Kevin March","Thanks, Rafael. Our orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenues to be in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standards that I mentioned earlier.","Acquisition charges, which are a non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and holds about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then declines about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year.","In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio grade to market reach and diverse and long-lived product positions, enabled important milestones in the year. These include solid revenue growth in our core businesses of Analog and Embedded, expansion of 300 millimeter Analog production, gross margin improvement of 340 basis points, operating margin improvement of 300 basis points, free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points, and continued free cash flow per share growth. We will continue to feed advantageous through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for our very long-time to come.","Before, I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI\u2019s performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. While you will continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well just as I have for all these year.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl","Thank you, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Kevin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Harlan Sur","Your automotive business grew 23% in 2016, obviously very solid results. Can you guys just help us understand, of the five sub-segments within the auto, what areas drove the more strength?","Kevin March","And as you noted, automotive did grow over 20%. The great news is that wasn\u2019t due to one segment. And I can see that that growth was very diverse, it was diverse across the five sectors that we saw. It was diverse across customers, and is also was very diverse across different product lines. So, we really are excited about the opportunity of both automotive and industrial, and we\u2019re just very pleased that the investments that we made are really kind of providing a base from which we can grow upon. Do you have follow on?","Harlan Sur","Yes, I do. Thank you for that. If I look at the recent SIA industry data, total analog is likely to be up above 5% this year, above $47 billion -- in 2016, your analog business was up about 2% last year, but obviously the growth was impacted by a largest customer that have an inventory correction last year. If you shift this out, does the team think that they gained analog market share, and if so in which of the sub-segments? Thank you.","Kevin March","I think that when we look at our peers with the publicly reported data, we actually believe that we\u2019ve performed quite well. So, we\u2019re probably earlier in the reporting season, so we\u2019ve got a few more to of our peers to put their numbers up. But we\u2019re very confident that we performed very well. So, thank you for that question. And we\u2019ll go to next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Danely with Citi. Go ahead please.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks guys. And Kevin congratulations on the next Phase, thanks for being patient -- I think the real reason you\u2019re leaving is you\u2019ve got tired of winning for TI to hit my $12 stock price, so -- that\u2019s a joke for all of you who are listening. If you could just list, I guess, the margin drivers and maybe rank them from here as far as how much room or how much leverage you have in terms of mix versus 300 millimeter versus utilization rates versus depreciation?","Kevin March","I hope not to revisit that $12 stock price you\u2019re talking about. Margin drivers, going forward, I think that there will be several things happening. I think we\u2019ve enjoyed the last couple of years. Depreciation coming down same time that 300 millimeter starts to be going up. And those sort of have been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flat out there on a quarter-over-quarter basis. They\u2019ll still be down next year versus 2016, but nearly as much that we\u2019ve seen.","What's the lot more important is the continued expansion of 300 millimeter production, as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You heard us again talk for a number years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And still between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300 millimeter capacity, there is still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth.","And that\u2019s before we even talked about revenue growth, where this revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we\u2019ve been investing for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is under-utilization charges of negligible. And so really, it's just about fall-through from revenue straight to the bottom line, and that will especially happen to cash flow.","Chris Danely","And so my follow-up longer term question on OpEx. So, if we look at year-over-year, your SG&A trended down a little bit. R&D was up. You guys have said you were going to -- little more money into R&D, assuming revenue continues to grow. What can we expect from R&D and SG&A on a yearly basis? Do you feel comfortable with the level of R&D as it is right here, and could we expect SG&A to continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue, assuming overall revenue growth?","Kevin March","Yes, Chris. That\u2019s a really good question. The last couple of years OpEx has on annual base run about 23% of revenue, and as you noted we have been internally reallocated resources pretty more percent to the R&D areas. That will continue for next couple of quarters and begin to stabilize, and I would expect in 2017 all things being equal will still up at around 23% of OpEx of revenue. Keep in mind that -- we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30% on very weak markets and that'd be as high as 30%. And in very strong markets, I might be wrong as low as 20% kind of stable markets we're in right now. I think the OpEx percent you've seen in the last two years is what you expect to get forward for the next year or two.","David Pahl","Right, thanks Chris. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.","Joe Moore","I wonder, if you talk about the change to the analog sub-segments as in particular Silicon Valley Analog is a category going only. Does that signify any from a business standpoint in terms of the integration of the old national business? Should we think if there being any structural change to goes along with that?","Kevin March","It has nothing to do with analog business, that\u2019s simply a question of realigning our products to the way that we have come to understand and our customer preferred to look for them when they trying to find products here at TI. And so, if you look at the categories that we've lined up with up as Power, we have Signal Chain and we have High Volume Analog & Logic. And that\u2019s really how we have learned our customers preferred to sort of fine products at TI. And so that\u2019s allows us to give them better and faster support.","The Silicon Valley Analog products along with High Performance Analog that's been reallocated among those segment of those new products lines that we've just talked about. So consequently, the best way to think about this is how do we react faster and more thoroughly to increase and searches for products in our portfolio. For the balance portfolio like ours, it's really important for us to be sure that we are aligned as efficiently as possible for customer to get to the parts they need more.","Joe Moore","Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s helpful thank you. And then just returning to the growth in autos, I guess we see the peer group is growing sort of high single digits maybe little bit better, so obviously you are growing quite a bit faster in autos than other analog companies. Should we think of that is being sort of sustainable gains? Or just how do you -- is anything you kind of help us understand why that was such a good number? And what should we expect going forward?","Kevin March","Joe, this isn't -- as you know and you have been tracking our revenues inside of that market for some time. It's not something that is capping this quarter, right. We have been having very strong growth inside of automotive and that is a result of how we allocate capital. We have for some time been directing investments and increases both in automotive and industrial. And that\u2019s because we think that those are the two markets that are going to provide growth, not just for us but in our industry. So -- and as you know, these are long tail type of design wins and revenue strength. And we are very intentional as I mentioned earlier trying to direct our investments, so we are not just seeing growth in one sector or at one customer. So, that\u2019s what we are trying to do. So thanks for that question. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Romit Shah with Nomura. Go ahead please.","Romit Shah","Yes, Kevin, congratulations on your retirement, all the best. I wanted ask Dave, did you gave us channel inventory, how much supply your distributors are carrying in the quarter?","David Pahl","I haven\u2019t but I would certainly can, inventory was even with the Eureco [ph] and decreased by about a half of week sequentially. And it's still running at around four weeks in the channel. And I just also have a reminder that that number benefits because of our consignment programs that we have in place with our distributors.","Romit Shah","You guys talked about moderate growth again last year, but there has been I guess talk more recently about stimulus better GDP growth under the new administration. And I'm curious, how do you think your distributors would react under that scenario? Do you think it's -- do you guys think about it as your distributors restocking as a major driver for this year?","Kevin March","Romit, I don\u2019t think that we're quite that precise on that kind of thinking as how distributors might react. We look at the talk of stimulus with some anticipation of the positive boost to the economy, but frankly we think it's probably too early to figure out what that might be and how might manifest it itself. A lot of that stimulus seems to be focused towards infrastructure, and so if in fact just wind up there that with the further benefit on our industrial portfolio. More important to us as to watch what's happening on the tax front, and hopefully we will finally get some tax relief out of Washington, which will be a significant benefit to our shareholders.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, Romit, I'll just add that if you look as I said inventory was even with where we ended last year, it was actually down sequentially. So reflected in our numbers really has no restocking inside of it. And I would just say that the inventory levels that they have, the inventory levels that we have, just reflect an environment where we've got good product availability. And because of our investments in capacity ahead of demand, if these things do show up and turn into more significant growth going forward, we're ready to be able to support that. So, thank you Romit and will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.","Ross Seymore","Thanks for letting me ask the question. And first Kevin congrats and to Rafael too congrats on the promotion. Looking at the Analog business in the fourth quarter Dave, it was up 10% year-over-year, but you said HVAL was flat. I was little surprised that that side being flat and the remainder must have been up a good 13% to 15% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers were that created such a delta between those segments?","David Pahl","Yes, so I think if you look at year-over-year by end market, personal electronics was down slightly due to mobile phones. So, if you back out mobile phones the actually personal electronics was up slightly, so that was the main reason that we saw that. You could kind of see that inside of our Analog. And that weakness in mobile phones was not just inside of HVAL, but you've saw that to a lesser extent inside the Power.","Ross Seymore","On the OpEx side of your equation, I know, Kevin, you answered some questions about the R&D remaining elevated. If we think in the first quarter traditionally that goes up for just beginning of the year reasons by about 5%. Is that about the right area we should think OpEx changing sequentially in 1Q or is it different issue due to that reallocation.","Kevin March","No, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything particularly different. The reallocation is mostly coming out of SG&A as we go forward, so it's just the mix coming out of that. So, total OpEx will continue to increase as you know seasonally in first quarter because of the absence holidays in the fourth quarter as well as the annual pay and benefit increases that we fully across our company in first quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Go ahead please.","Stacy Rasgon","Around the gross margin drives particularly 300 millimeters, you seem to be talking about that is probably the biggest driver on a go forward basis structurally. Can you talk to about us in terms of where you are on 300 millimeter utilization versus a year ago particularly given the amount of extension that you are doing? How much I guess room do you still have to grow there? And how does that compare to where you were a year ago?","Kevin March","Yes, Stacy, I think that we have talked about between Richardson factory, which we call RFAB and the PMOS6 in Dallas location. If combined, we have about $8 billion of revenue generating capacity in those factories combined. We have continued to increase starts meaningfully on 300 millimeter for analog. And that is really going to be picking up pace more and more the new products that we are released and are being released on 300 millimeter. And the economics as you all aware are very compelling, I mean the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less from 300 millimeters versus 200 millimeters.","So, the total finished products about 20% less, which add meaningfully, not only to gross margins but especially free cash flow. So that\u2019s a small space, we want to repeat it. So, again our starts continue to increase, and we continue to have a lot of capacity available to us. But more importantly, we have a lot of new devices and the pipeline being released onto 300 millimeter, and that all coming together will probably continue to accelerate the rate of starts and therefore we also will get from that manufacturing market.","David Pahl","I'll just add Stacy as a seamless plug for our capital management call. Rafael and I'll cover more that detail in our capital management call.","Stacy Rasgon","For my follow-up, I want to touch a bit on the accounting changes, and it seems to be influencing both the earnings as well as the share count. The diluted share count went up this quarter for the first time, and for everybody it sounds like, it was boosted by 500 million shares or so like because of the accounting change. So how should we think about that I guess going to 2017? Is it still something like a $0.03 or $0.04 per quarter benefits that's going to sort of sustain kind of into perpetuity? And in terms of share count, was it sort of like a one-time step-up? And should we still think about shares declining going forward even given I guess the increased dividends to reduced buybacks?","Kevin March","So, Stacy, just a little more background on this gap change, it's going to impact all companies beginning $11 implemented being in the first quarter 2017 reported. So, we are basically only adopted by one quarter. The idea is trying to help with the better comparability for 2016 or '17. That being said, it does cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit. It also met medical requires you compete with your share count differently and so added about 5 million shares to the share count just complaint to new calculation rules.","In 2016, had we applied to the same gap at the beginning of the year, it would have added $0.04 to the first quarter, $0.03 for the second quarter, $0.04 for the third quarter and added a penny to the fourth quarter for total of $0.13 for the year. The way that we would recommend that you model for purposes of analyzing a company going forward is somewhat we are doing and that is just look at what happened last year and used that same sort of assumption for next year.","I am pretty sure that will wind up be in different when we close the books on those assumptions, but that\u2019s the best way to model. So consequently, we had $0.04 that would have occurred in the first quarter 2016, and the guidance that we just offered for the first quarter 2017 is included $0.04, and we would suggest as it same thing.","David Pahl","Stacy, let me just add to that that are -- for looking at next year our commitment, our capital management strategy and the discipline execution of that strategy remains unchanged. Our target is to return all of our free cash to the owners of the Company. And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases.","Operator","We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to wish congratulations and good luck to Kevin and welcome to Rafael. So my first question, I know it's early days, but can you share any views on impact from any potential borrowed tax rate change or conversely any lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate? What would TI do differently, if either of these two things were to happen?","Kevin March","Vivek, this is very speculative at this stage because clearly you can see just from reported press, so there is difference with opinions as to what kind of tax policies to employ between the President and the Congress. So, I think it's little bit hard for us to be able to characterize what that might do. What I can say is that any form of relief will be beneficial directed to our shareholders because that will simply expand our free cash flow.","And as Rafael just commented, our commitment remains as it has been, best to return on 100% of free cash flow to our shareholder through dividend and stock not buybacks. So, any form whether it's borrower tax adjustments or actual lowering of the overall tax brackets clearly will be beneficial to our shareholders, and I am looking forward to seeing that happen.","David Pahl","You have follow on to that?","Vivek Arya","Yes, thanks Dave. Last quarter, you mentioned that it's seems like it's been in at 3% to 4% growth, but then you grew 7% in Q4 and you are guiding to 10% plus in Q1. I understand part of it is probably just normalization at one of your larger customers. But what is driving the upside, is it sustainable? Are we now in a 7% plus growth or like what's the change this year to deter us from that kind of growth trajectory?","Kevin March","Yes. So, first Vivek, I\u2019ll just point out that when we look at the overall microenvironment, we really don\u2019t see something that has significantly changed in sometime. So, we continue to believe that we're operating in a very similar microenvironment that we have, that we haven't been If you look at inside of the quarter, demand came in stronger, really across most markets in businesses. The only notable exception as I talked about before was personal electronic came in about as we expected.","And to your point, we are seeing choppiness in particular markets. Some of that more recently has been driven by one large customer. You can go back to clock not too long ago into last year we saw some choppiness in comps equipment before that we had a PC, XP refresh cycle that came to an end. And none of those were really tighter the overall economy, there was just very specific things going on within specific market. So, that's really the environment that we thing that we're operating in now. So, thank you and we'll go to next caller please.","Operator","Next is John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.","John Pitzer","Thanks for letting me ask the question and I'll chime in with my congratulations to Kevin. Kevin, I guess my first question is just looking at the up margins on the embedded business. You did a great job throughout calendar year 2016, as you grew that business to drive leverage and upside to the operating margins, but there is still a pretty healthy gap between the up margins and embedded and those in Analog. Is that still just the matter of getting more scale in the embedded business? Or how do we think about those up margins closing overtime.","Kevin March","John, I think that's quite I think about it is, but we have been talking about for number of years, which means you set up investments in that area in number of years back. And then we readjust the investments especially for the base stations marketplaces, and since then we think we've got the investment that was about right. So, it really is a question of continuing to get leverage from revenue grown.","Falling always through to up margins you pointed up, but again what we focused on that falls through on a free cash flow, and that's a real focus. So, there is nothing inherent that keeps it from continuing to improve in fact I would not be surprise to see as the team there continue to improve on that as they to put me understand where leverage capability they have on the investment base they have right now.","John Pitzer","Yes, this is my follow-on. I apologize for asking, but a lot of my questions were already asked and answered. But just on the other revenue line, maybe if you look at your revenue holistically overtime, it's become significantly less volatile but that other bucket has jumped around a lot on quarter-on-quarter. And Dave, let me be just give us some guidance from these levels how we should think about kind of seasonality or the cadence of the other rep going forward?","David Pahl","Yes, I think if you look for -- look at it for the full year, it decreased 3% year-on-year. And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned. And we expect kind of going forward that we would be somewhere in a mid-single digit decline. There is seasonality inside of the other business it's driven primarily by calculators, they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school and then we also have royalties inside there that can choppy every once in a while. So those are the types of things, but overall when you look at much like this year we saw a 3% decline just probably similar to what we would expect to see going forward.","Operator","The next is the Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead please.","Ambrish Srivastava","Kevin, congratulations on your next phase of life and you've been nothing but an absolute pleasure in all the dealings we have had to do, so thank you for that. My first question Dave is on the industrial business, auto is a great business for you, over the years you have been consistently outgrowing the industry, but automotive is a $4 billion business. And I think a year ago, I had given you not really a lot of hard time, but I had asked you why the business didn\u2019t grow last year? So that was in 2015, but you are growing this business again at a pretty decent rate almost 10%, so what are some of the areas that are driving that growth?","David Pahl","Ambrish, actually, if you look at the actual numbers I know you are using the rounded numbers that we've gave you. It's more like the mid-single digit, so a growth for the Europe, for industrial '16 over '15, and it good to see, good solid growth there. When we look the down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors 14 year. So again it's kind of same comments and hit on the automotive we are just encouraged that our investments are really turning to that broad based growth. Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","I did. On the consumer side in specifically in mobile would March quarters and be up year-over-year? And would consumer be up year-over-year? All I am trying to understand is if the indigestion you had a year ago is that was supposed to bear that it will last into March or its behind us.","David Pahl","Yes, so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any sector, but I think your instincts that will have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a year ago will probably be correct. We have got time for one last call please.","Operator","Last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.","Toshiya Hari","My first question is again on industrial and Dave I appreciate your comments about they're being broad based growth in the segment. But if I recall correctly, I think this is the second conservative quarter where you guys point to an improvement in the industrial market place. So just curious if there are any kind of specific regions or end market areas well that\u2019s kind of driving that infection and in the market and industrial?","David Pahl","Yes, there is a -- we are seeing that really broad based growth across regions, across products and across those 14 sectors that we have got in it. So, we're real pleased with that growth. Do you have a follow-on Toshiya?","Toshiya Hari","Yes, thanks Dave. This is a technical one. So the IP, the one-time benefit you guys saw in Q4 from your IP agreements. Is this one-time in nature? Or could we see this materialized again in future quarters? And also what the nature of the contractor or the agreement was for this?","David Pahl","Yes, it included several agreements with the several different cross licensees, but the part of that was a sale of some IP assets, and that was recognized and restructuring other lines. And then the balance was settlement of past infringement that was recognized in the other income expense model. On an ongoing basis, it tends to be multi across license agreements. So, we would expect about $20 million of annual benefit for the foreseeable future as a result of agreement to these new intellectual property contracts. It's a roughly $20 million a year annual benefit going forward.","David Pahl","And thank you all for joining us. Again please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 8th at 10 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"20457":["Texas Instruments, Inc.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. As usual Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our web at TI.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendar. We plan to hold a call on February 4, at 10:00 AM Central time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done for the last two years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.","Turning to our earnings update, the fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew again with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these two items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.","In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3 percentage point improvement from a year-ago period.","We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy which includes our growing 300 mm output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.","In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago led by Power Management. High Volume Analog and Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the 6th quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for analog.","Embedded processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago, due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for embedded processing. In our other segment, revenues declined 14% from a year ago, due to legacy wireless and custom ASIC products.","Turning to distribution, re-sales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of analog and embedded processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by a week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks.","This level has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago.","With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributor's location. We carry higher loads of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program which has several benefits such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.","Turning to our end markets, in 2014 industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 13%, personal electronics 29%, communications equipment 17%, enterprise systems 6% and other 4%.","We continue to refine our understanding of our customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last two years of updated market estimates and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference. Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, analog and embedded processing revenue grew a combined 12% with analog up 13% and embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014.","These two key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they are driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.","Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Kevin March","Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from the year-ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory load-ins and an improved product portfolio focused on analog and embedded processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.","Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing and in Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings.","Acquisition charges were $82 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit, due to gains on sales of assets. Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing.","While this is solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement for the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. It is consistent with a growing portion of our product demands being supported with consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory.","We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end market demand that allow us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years, as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so.","Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.","Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or protectively reinvested in the business. As we've noted our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.","In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash in our cash management, our tax practices. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion up 11% from a year ago.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges which are non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years.","Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than the last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in analog and embedded processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is a diverse and long-lived positions in many markets.","We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long term indicator of shareholder value.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Vicki, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Vicki?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Chris Danely with Citi.","Chris Danely","Kevin, I guess if you had to characterize the overall environment now versus say a quarter ago or a year ago would you say broadly speaking not much has changed we're still in this fine roughly seasonal environment? Or have you seen any changes in visibility or your overall business?","Kevin March","No, Chris, I think you said it. While it probably hasn't really changed all that much there was a slight change in our book-to-bill on a year-over-year basis. This quarter was about 0.97. A year ago quarter was 0.94, but frankly because more and more of our orders are coming in on consignment I think book-to-bill means less and less about a particular of where our revenue is going. So I think that to summarize our sense, it's more steady as she goes just like we've seen for the last few years of an economy just growing along on a steady basis and we're trying to take advantage of growing a little bit faster than that.","Dave Pahl","Yes, and Chris, let me add, just, the other things that we see. If you look at our inventory, it's at a healthy level. Our channel inventories are actually down a week, as I said earlier, from a year ago, just under 4.5 weeks. Our lead times remain consistent, our cancellations and reschedules remain very, very low and in addition, we continue to deliver our products on time for customers. So those types of things are always a good indication for the overall environment too. Do you have a follow-up?","Chris Danely","Yes. So it sounds like things are pretty normal, seasonal this year. Can you give us any sense of the relative growth rates of your major product lines this year? What you're expecting between analog, embedded and the other stuff?","Dave Pahl","No, we don't try to forecast out a year on the major product lines or even at the company level. I will point out that both of those product lines turned in another year of market share gains and certainly, we're working really hard to do that for another year and we'll just have to see how the year turns out.","Operator","We will go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava","On the inventory front, are we to assume now that your visibility now, vis-a-vis in the past is higher also, because of a higher percentage is consignment off the disti? And within that, that gives you better visibility? Is that the right way to think about it? So the days are going up versus what your targeted range is and really not comparable to if we look at the last 5 year and 10 year median. And then I had a quick follow up.","Kevin March","Ambrish, I don't know that I would necessarily go to improved visibility, but we do get I would say a much more improved or real-time feedback from what's actually going on with true end demand for our products and the real benefit of that is that we can adjust our factories on a real-time basis whereas as you point out, if you went back a number of years, we carried far fewer days of inventory.","But the signal as to how fast our products are actually being consumed in the end market also took a lot longer to get to us and so we'd respond later. Now, we can respond much more quickly. So it's less a question of improved visibility as it is a question of much more real-time feedback as to just how fast our products are being consumed.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, thanks for the clarification, Kevin, that's what I meant because we always get into this debate in end cycles about sell-in and sell-through. My quick question is, what should we be modeling for CapEx for this year? Thank you.","Kevin March","Yes. I would continue to recommend that you assume that we will average about 4% of our revenues on CapEx on average, over multi-year periods. Some years might be a little lighter like it was this past year where we came in at about 3% in 2014, but on average, we expect 4% and that's how we build our own internal models.","Operator","Next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Kevin, 90 days ago, when you were talking about OpEx for the December quarter you said that looking back a year-ago and how it flowed a year ago was probably a good model and you even mentioned that it would probably be a good model going into the calendar first quarter. Is that statement still hold? Or can you help us understand the puts and takes on OpEx going into the March quarter especially around some seasonal costs?","Kevin March","Yes, John, you're exactly right. So going from fourth quarter to first quarter, the best way to model that is to take a look -- really, the last year is a good starting point. We typically are up in the mid-single digits from fourth to first on OpEx and that's because of the absence of the holiday periods that we have in the fourth quarter and the annual startup of pay and benefit increases that we have in first quarter.","This year we might be up just a little bit more than that versus a year ago simply because on higher profitability that we are expecting for the year, we also expect higher variable compensation accruals and so that may take our fourth to first up a little bit higher than what you saw about a year ago.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-on, John?","John Pitzer","Yes, I do. Just going back to the analog space, Dave, maybe you can give us a little bit more color because it's pretty impressive. You guys put up double-digit growth year-over-year this quarter, against pretty hard compares from the year-ago quarter. So I'm just kind of curious to what extent do you think your market share gains could be accelerating around your consignment efforts? Or if you could just help me understand a little bit better? I know you talked about power leading the way this quarter. Can you help me understand a little bit more why the growth seems to be doing much better than some of your peers?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I think when you look year-over-year first of all, it's good to have all four of those businesses contributing to the growth. Certainly, power is benefiting from just a secular trend of things wanting to run more off of batteries and things that do get plugged in becoming more efficient. We also have a very strong product line there too. So I think that those things are helping us to gain share. We've talked about for some time, that it's not one thing inside of a business like analog or embedded processing that allows you to gain share. There is a lot of things that you have to do to be a good analog company and we've got a lot of competitors that fit that category, but we've got other things, like the scale of our -- and reach of our sales force, our presence on the web, our manufacturing footprint, the technology that we bring to bear and the breath of the product portfolio. I think it's just all those things working together.","Kevin March","I would probably add one more thing there too, is our strategy of -- that we've discussed for a couple years now of buying our capacity ahead of our needs and always have an ample capacity, quite frankly gives our customers, new and old, increased confidence that we have adequate capacity to meet their demand requirements and they see us consistently maintaining short lead times. So that's just another element that helps us be able to win market share versus some of the other competitors that we're up against.","Operator","We will go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. Thank you for taking us to the OpEx step-up here in Q1. Now with most of the embedded in Japan restructuring behind you, continued discipline on the team's part, how should we think about the OpEx trends beyond the first quarter? I think Kevin, I heard you mention your embedded OpEx kind of holding flattish, but how should we think about the overall business beyond Q1?","Kevin March","So Harlan, I think the best way to think about that is we discussed -- I think it was back in 2011 that on average, we would expect our OpEx to run between 20% and 30% of revenues. So like in a weak market, it might be at the 30% level and in stronger markets it would be in the 20% level. We're performing quite well in our markets right now and so you're seeing that OpEx come down. In fact, most recently in the second half of 2014 we were running around 23% of revenue and so I would say that you would want to model us in the lower half of that range, as you try to think about how much our OpEx spend will be in 2015.","Dave Pahl","Great. You have a follow-on, Harlan?","Harlan Surveillance","Yes. Thank you for that. Your thoughts, directionally on utilization levels here in Q1? Given the seasonality in your business, I would assume that it's down again given the book-to-bill ratio and the revenue guidance for Q1. Is that also how we should think directionally about gross margins, as well?","Kevin March","I think the way you need to think about utilization is first by definition because we buy capacity ahead of time, we will by definition be operating in an underutilized environment versus our maximum capacity -- theoretical capacity. But that aside, because of manufacturing cycle times, the material that we're starting in the first quarter, especially as we move into the second month of the first quarter, really is destined for second quarter shipments.","So your utilization tends to proceed the quarter you're moving into as to what your expectations are and as the second quarter for the last 3, 4, 5 years now and normally for us is a growth quarter compared to the first quarter, we will adjust our factory loadings accordingly to our expectation to second quarter revenue expectations.","Operator","We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon","I think to follow up on that gross margin question, it looks to me your implied guidance for margins is maybe 57, maybe a little higher, so low 57, it's down a little bit on revenues that are down slightly with inventories a little higher. Could you just give us some feeling of -- if you don't want to give numbers, at least some of the drivers for gross margins into Q1? And in particular, what are you planning to do with the inventory on your own balance sheet? How will that trend?","Kevin March","Yes. I don't know that I necessarily have -- don't want to get into the GPM per se. Let me just talk a little bit more about what our inventory levels might look like and how that might drive us. We don't have an inventory forecast, per se, but given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we would expect our factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter as I mentioned a moment ago.","One of the things to keep in mind, when you adjust your faculty loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter you take your loadings. Coming into fourth quarter, our loadings would be dropping coming into the quarter and going into first quarter, our loadings would start to increase during the quarter. And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag, when you try to track the GPM that follows with that which I think is what you are asking for there, Stacy.","I think more importantly, what we see going forward is that our margins we expect to continue to improve along with our free cash flow. By virtue of the fact that analog and embedded processing continue to become a larger portion of our total revenues and by virtue of the fact that 300 mm manufacturing continues to be a larger portion of our total production, as we go forward and both of those result in both higher margins and higher free cash flow.","Stacy Rasgon","For my follow up, just to touch on the tax rate. So your guidance for next year, 30%, a little higher than your guidance for 2014 was which I think was 28%. I just wanted to verify, is the only real source of that just the higher profit versus expectation? I think you had told us before to tax every incremental dollar of profit around at the incremental tax rate, 35%.","Kevin March","Yes. Stacy, that's correct. In fact, our tax rate in 2014, our guidance was as you said, they rounded down to 28%. It actually came in just a little bit higher than that, if it weren't for the R&D credit and so we're looking at it rounding up to 30%, as we move into 2015. So you're exactly right. As you model what you would expect our earnings and fall-through to be, you should tax that at approximately 35% Delta profit as it comes through during the year.","Dave Pahl","And I'll just point out too Stacy, that that does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that we got for 2014.","Kevin March","Yes. If that does reinstate, that would be between 1 and 2 points of tax benefit.","Operator","We will go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Actually, when I look at your Q4 results versus consensus estimates, you did better in your core analog and embedded segments. But there was some shortfall in the other sales which are actually down 6% year-on-year. I think they were down almost 11% last year and I believe you mentioned some loss of ASIC business. I'm wondering, what is the right way Kevin or Dave to model this segment? Because it is a very profitable segment for you. It is still a decent size segment and I think in the past, you have mentioned that it could be flattish, plus\/minus 2% or so. So just conceptually, what is the right way to model the segment?","Dave Pahl","Yes. If you look back at the other segment, the first thing I would point out is, it has a calculated revenue and the seasonally strong back-to-school season happened, but in second and third quarter. So those tend to be the seasonally strongest quarter. Third to fourth, that biggest transition sequentially, of course is due to the change of that business. If you look overall, you can look at the components that fit inside of other. The first is DLP and I described that as a more steady business and one that might have some -- we've described as wild cards of new opportunities.","The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today, as well as in cinema and we've got some -- what we call pico projectors or small form factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there is some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators and that business has been, I would say flat maybe slightly down over time.","And then royalties have run steady about $40 million to $50 million a quarter and that's probably a good thing to look and then we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business that's in communications infrastructure and we believe that that will move over. So you net all that stuff together and we think that the other segment will be flat, maybe up or down 1 percentage point, as we've described in the past.","Kevin March","And I think Vivek, you also asked about year-over-year. Just recall that last year still had about $55 million or so of wireless revenue it in that this year is essentially zero. So that's your biggest decline on a year-over-year basis.","Vivek Arya","Yes. So as my follow-on, back to your core business, do you think you have the right scale in your embedded business to take op margins into the 20s? So when I look at the three areas within that business; processors, connectivity, microcontrollers, how would you rank TI against the best competitor in that segment? And really, I'm trying to understand how you can grow that segment, gain share, improve margins while keeping investments flattish, while all your competitors are all investing in their respective businesses. Thank you.","Kevin March","Vivek, I'll leave it to you to analyze the competitors. I'll speak to how TI is doing. You may recall back in late 2010 early 2011 timeframe, we significantly stepped up our investments in that particular segment in order to accelerate our product introductions and therefore begin to accelerate our revenue growth and if you take a look at what's happened over the last, as Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, nine quarters of sequential or continuous year-over-year growth that strategy has paid off. So those products are really beginning to take.","And as you know, those kinds of products tend to have very long shelf lives, so we expect to see more of the same on that. Now while we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we are investing is still quite high and that's why the operating profit is still not quite where we think entitlement will take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at the level that you saw us invest in in the prior few years.","So those combined, the high levels of investment, an expanding product portfolio from heavier levels of investment in the prior few years, have all given us very strong growth in that segment and will continue to give us growth and quite frankly based upon some of the best in class performance that you can look at out there, we have -- shall we say, expectations similar to at least as well as those companies are operating.","Dave Pahl","Yes and I would also add, Vivek if you look at our product portfolio like inside of microcontrollers, we've got two architectures there where we'll introduce new products with new interfaces and meet new standards, inside of that. A lot of our competitors will have half a dozen or a dozen, different architectures where they've got to spread their R&D investment over. So we can be very efficient with that.","And in addition if you remember, as part of the wireless restructuring, we brought over those connectivity products that really already had a pretty significant investment in those wireless technologies. So we're supporting nearly a dozen different wireless standards today and that group is really focused on growing the top line rather than having to develop baseline technologies.","Operator","We will go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello","A lot of great questions asked already. My one question is just around the long term segment goals that you might have. Auto is kind of low double digits, personal electronic is almost 30%, although that's coming down. Is the goal really from a segment diversification standpoint, to continue to increase in particular that auto sub-category and decrease the personal electronics category say, over the next two or three years?","Kevin March","Yes Jim. Our goal is not necessarily to try to optimize that mix, per se. I would say that, if you look inside of personal electronics as an example, we'll look for places where we can find sustainable revenue with a differentiated position. And if you look at some of our largest customers that we sell products into, we'll sell several hundred devices into those customers and those products could be anywhere from $0.75 down to $0.05 and oftentimes, they may have lives that live from one generation of a product to another.","So those are the types of opportunities that we try to look for in a space like Comms Equipment. Now certainly, from an incremental investment profile, if we had an extra $1 to spend and we had an opportunity to spend that in either industrial or automotive those products in general just tend to have longer life cycles and better characteristics. So that may see an increase in investment. And then lastly, I would just add that those two markets I think have the secular trends that you are well aware of. So we'll benefit from that as the rest of the industry will and of course, we hope to benefit disproportionately from those investments.","Dave Pahl","Do you have a follow-on, Jim?","Jim Covello","Yes. I guess I'll stick on that topic. So personal electronics has been coming down, but your view would be it's not really a function of an intentional effort on the part of Texas Instruments. It's just more a function of the other businesses that you have or just happen to be better long term growth areas and it's naturally coming down. Is that the right characterization?","Dave Pahl","And even more specific than that I think if you backed out legacy wireless, you'll see that it's actually been fairly stable, as a mix. So that change in percentage is more driven by the strategic decision to exit that one portion of the business.","Operator","We will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","I also wanted to ask about the end market breakdown that you guys provide. If I look at where you were a year ago, and there was probably some reclassification, but it looked like industrial went from 24% in 2013 to 31% in 2014 and personal assistance from 37% to 29%. Those swings seem dramatic. I just wanted to see if there was some change in the way you were looking at the breakdown?","Dave Pahl","Yes, Joe. We continued to refine our understanding of our customers and markets and we've got better tools and software. So if you go out to our web now, you'll actually see two years of history that we have out there, as well as the identified sectors that those markets made up.","Operator","We will go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Kevin, just to follow up to Vivek's discussion on embedded processing and expense control, it's really the flip side of that. Can you talk a little bit about what you're looking at before you would start to invest more in the business? It's clear you want higher operating margins than you have now but what are the things that TI is looking at before it will commit to incremental investment in that business?","Kevin March","Yes Craig, I would say we're probably quite a ways off before we even have to entertain a question like that. Our focus for the next few years is managing the total spend inside that business and driving top line growth and frankly, if we begin to see top line growth then begin to net the kind of bottom-line results that we can see happening in other players in that space, at that point in time we might entertain increasing our spending but not until then.","Craig Ellis","And then the follow-up is really taking another swing at something that Chris brought up which is longer-term growth on a segment basis. At least in my model, calendar '14 was the first year in the last four or five where embedded processing and analog had similar growth rates and they were both double digits. Just philosophically, as you look at those two businesses which have had very different histories, are there reasons why they should have materially different growth rates going forward? Or given that they are both closer to operating on more optimal levels, should they be fairly similar?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I think when you begin to look longer term at the growth rate and the potentials of those businesses, I would start with what do you believe the semiconductor market will grow on. We have held the position that we think that the semiconductor market roughly grows at twice the rate of GDP. There is some that will violently agree with this and some that will violently disagree with that basic assumption. But whatever that assumption is, we think both analog and Embedded Processing are big enough portions of the market that they will grow in-line with that.","If you look at those businesses certainly over the last five years, they both have continued to gain share and we believe that we're continuing to invest and we've got a lot of room to gain share. And in fact, in analog we've got 18.3% market share and inside of Embedded Processing, we've got around 15 percentage points. So lots of headroom to do that and we've gained probably 30, 40, sometimes more than that in market share on a given year. We still have to have everyone report before all the final numbers are in but we're confident that we'll gain share again this year. So Kevin, do you have anything to add to that?","Kevin March","Yes. Craig, one thing I would recommend you maybe take a look at. If you do look at those two segments, analog and embedded processing, their quarterly growth rates I think that was the point you were making. They can vary quite markedly from one another. If you look at the two of them on a year-over-year basis, they actually are much more correlated than you might expect. They're both gaining share as Dave was mentioning and are both growing quite nicely on a year-over-year basis. So if you do some measurements for those two segments on year-over-year growth rates and compare that back over the last half dozen quarters or so, I think you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow pretty similarly to each other.","Operator","We will go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Kevin, as you go into your capital management conference call next week, could you just remind us what your historical philosophy has been on levering the balance sheet to drive shareholder value?","Kevin March","Well Mark, what we've talked about on debt that -- we have debt on the balance sheet today. It will be there until 2023 because that is when the last of the current outstanding bonds matures and our attitude towards debt is that it will continue to be part of the balance sheet when the economics make sense and for us, that economics making sense means that if we can borrow at interest rates that we perceive to be below what we expect our inflation rates to be or correspondingly at less than our dividend yield, then we think that's probably a pretty good deal on behalf of our shareholders and so that will be the kind of parameters that we look at, as we continue to decide how much debt to carry on the balance sheet and as bonds mature going forward. We do actually have a $1 billion of debt maturing in 2015. We have $250 million maturing in April and $750 million maturing in August of 2015.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-on, Mark?","Mark Lipacis","Yes. Thank you for that color. So the analog business operating margins are about 2000 basis points higher than the embedded. As we think about the potential profitability of the embedded business, are there structural reasons why embedded profitability could not equal the analog profitability longer-term? Thank you.","Kevin March","Mark, I think the simple answer in my mind is it's difficult for us to find evidence of somebody in the marketplace outside of TI, who has been able to perform at those kind of levels. I think the economics are such that it'll be very attractive. It's going to be a great place for us to be in, but it probably doesn't quite get up to par of what you see in analog. I think analog is quite unique in what it can produce for companies and for shareholders who all own those companies like we do.","Operator","We will go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri","Just a question again on gross margin and what the possible headroom is, I guess if you look at the embedded business, you're up to 17%, but if you look at some of the well-run peers in that space, they're doing sort of mid-20s. So maybe ask a little bit different way, is there any reason why you can't get the embedded margins up to the mid-20s?","Kevin March","No. There is no reason why we can't do that.","Dave Pahl","Yes. We've made good progress. Obviously, Tim, we still have work to do, but we believe that we can get into that range with revenue growth and so that's what we're planning to do. They've got a good start. You've nine quarters in a row of year-on-year growth and are making progress towards moving that operating margin higher. Do you have a follow-on?","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. I do, yes. And then just relative to the inventory, certainly some of it is structural as you indicated, but is any of the rise in inventory related to your perception that June could be a little bit better than seasonal quarter?","Kevin March","Tim, I would say that it's probably too early for us to call the entire second quarter. Right now, we're focused on first quarter. So the inventory that we've got staged today is designed to support our first quarter needs and then as we adjust our factory loadings in first quarter, that inventory that we build will be designed to deal with our second quarter needs. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect we will be ramping up our factories as we go through first quarter in support of second quarter and when we get to the end of the quarter we will find out how much inventory we're holding at that point in time.","Operator","We will go to our last question from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman","I guess if I could dig deep into some of the results that you've reported and maybe some of the outlook that you might have by key markets out there. I think investors are interested to hear what you're seeing in the PC and server power markets as well as maybe the disk drive markets. And if you could offer some color on what you're seeing in the communications market as well? I think those are -- maybe not that overly material to the TI story, but they are to investors in general.","Dave Pahl","Okay, Doug, let me share some end market trends that we've seen. I think that that may address some of those issues, maybe not down at the level that you are quite asking. So I think you were talking about PCs and those would fall into our personal electronics products. On a year-on-year basis, they were up, despite the declines that Kevin had mentioned earlier in legacy wireless and that growth was led by mobile phones. If you look at industrial and I want to point out, when we talk about industrial we've been very intentional about how to measure that and it's different than when investors talk about the industrial market.","And the sectors, we've got a dozen sectors that make up industrial and they include things like factory automation and control, medical, healthcare, fitness, building automation, smart grid, motor drives, displays those types of things, the full list is out on our website. And we've seen that was up led by medical and healthcare fitness. Appliance, factory automation and smart grid were also up from a year ago. Comms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure and then enterprise systems were up, primarily due to projectors. So with that, you have a follow-on?","Doug Freedman","Yes, I guess for my follow-on, just what are you seeing in terms of any shift in the competitive landscape? I know investors are somewhat concerned over what we're seeing in China from an investment standpoint. Is there anything in your markets that you're seeing that would point to any change in the competitive landscape?","Kevin March","Doug, as it relates to China in particular, because you've mentioned that there we've been in China for a very long time now. We have I think over a dozen sales and R&D sites there. We have both a wafer fabrication facility and an assembly test site there. In addition, we have thousands of customers buying thousands of parts and consequently, we've become a very important supplier to a large number of Chinese companies across a very diverse set of markets.","So we see China as continuing to be a great opportunity for TI regardless of any of the competitive environments out there and our goal is to operate in China just like we do in the rest of the world which is to make ourselves an integral part of their success and an indispensable supplier and we've got a great shall I say, a long way -- we're a long way into that already and we feel pretty good about our position.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Great. Thanks for that question, Doug and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again on our February 4 Capital Management Call. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"20394":["Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 22, 2013  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Ron Slaymaker - Vice President of Investor Relations","Kevin P.

At this time, I'd like to turn conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.","The second quarter was another solid quarter for TI. Revenue came in as we expected, up 6% sequentially and up 8% if you exclude legacy wireless revenue, which declined to less than 5% of TI revenue in the quarter. Analog and Embedded Processing increased to 78% of TI revenue. Our overall backlog continued to increase, visibility into the second quarter has improved and we expect another quarter of solid growth in the third quarter.","The industrial and automotive markets were once again important drivers of TI revenue growth. More than 35% of our product revenue in the first half of 2013 came from these important markets. Although we continue to have exposure to the PC and handset markets, these are now much smaller percentages of our revenue. We believe this increased diversity of markets and customers should make for steadier growth and financial returns.","The strength of our business model continues to give us confidence that we can sustainably generate $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue and then return all of it to shareholders except what is required to repay debt. As we said previously, free cash flow is an important consideration for a couple of reasons. First, net income has generally lagged the amount of free cash flow that we have generated for the past few years and will continue to lag in the years ahead. This is because of the significant noncash items on the income statement, including amortization of acquisition intangibles, as well as the large amount by which depreciation exceeds our capital expenditures. The second reason free cash flow is important is that cash returns are a big part of our long-term shareholders' returns. The more free cash flow we generate, the more we return in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. For the trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was 24% of revenue, 1 point higher than last quarter. And once again, we returned all of that and more to our shareholders, consistent with our capital management strategy. Earnings in the second quarter were strong, a result of good operational execution and improving product mix and a transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer, reflecting our continued monetization of the legacy wireless business even as this product revenue declines.","Let me walk through a few details of revenue. Analog revenue grew 6% sequentially. Silicon Valley Analog, High-Volume Analog and logic and High-Performance Analog all contributed to the sequential growth. Power was about even as growth in broader markets was offset by weaker demand at certain handset customers and game console manufacturers, which were preparing for a product transition. SVA, with its strong participation in the industrial and automotive markets, has been the leading driver of growth within our Analog business. Additionally, it has outgrown the Analog market over the past 3 quarters. From a market share perspective, SVA troughed in the second half of 2012, and its share has significantly rebounded as it has grown since then. As we have communicated to you previously, our original expectation for SVA was that it would continue to lose share in the first year after the acquisition, grow similar to the market in this second year and then gain share in the upcoming third year. We're running a full year ahead of this plan.","Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% sequentially, with processors up the most, followed by growth in microcontrollers and connectivity. Although connectivity was the smallest contributor, its growth rate was the highest as a range of customers embraced our low-power products. In processors, communications infrastructure had solid growth, reflecting increased operator spending, especially in North America.","In our other segments, sequential growth in most product areas was largely offset by the decline in legacy wireless. Legacy wireless revenue fell by $62 million sequentially to $148 million. Calculators grew as retailers prepared for back-to-school demand. DLP grew, driven by demand for high-resolution front projectors, and custom ASIC revenue was about even. Royalties declined.","Turning to distribution. Resales grew 5% sequentially. Distributors' inventory levels held about even on a dollar basis and declined by about 1 day.","Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin P. March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Our earnings in the quarter included a gain of $315 million associated with a transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer. This gain was recorded on the restructuring charges line of our income statement and in our other segment. The gain was partially offset by related expenses. The net gain was not included in the guidance we provided to you previously. In addition, restructuring charges were higher than originally expected. The net impact of these items was a $0.16 benefit to earnings per share in the quarter.","Gross profit was $1.57 billion, up 14% sequentially. Gross margin was 51.5% of revenue and expanded 390 basis points sequentially. This strong profit fall-through was a result of our increasing leverage of the low-cost capacity we have in place and our improving product mix as lower-margin legacy wireless revenue continued to wind down and higher-margin Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew.","Operating expenses of $860 million were reduced by $18 million sequentially. Operating profit was $906 million or 29.7% of revenue. Net income in the second quarter was $660 million, or $0.58 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $674 million in the quarter. I should note that the gain on the technology transfer did not impact cash flow as payment was not due in the quarter. You can see this impact on the prepaid expenses and other returned assets line of the cash flow statement. We increased our inventory by $20 million compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days increased to 105 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $577 million. Although cash flow from operations was about the same as the year ago, our free cash flow was higher as our capital spending needs are lower. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.32 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $427 million, down 28% from a year ago. As a result, free cash flow was $2.90 billion, up 10% from a year ago.","Free cash flow was 24% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. In the year-ago trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was 20% of revenue.","Capital expenditures for the past 12 months were about 3% of revenue. Our low capital spending level is a direct result of the strong capacity position that we have built with our strategic investments of the past few years. The cash flow that will result as we continue to fill up this capacity should be strong in the years ahead.","I'll note that depreciation expense for the past 12 months exceeded our capital expenditures by $495 million. As a percent of revenue, depreciation was more than 400 basis points higher than our capital expenditures. This is one of the reasons why our free cash flow has been trending higher than our net income. Of course, depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending over the next few years, benefiting gross margin as it does. Another major reason why free cash flow has trended higher than net income is the amortization expense of $80 million to $85 million per quarter that will remain on our income statement for another 6 years. In the trailing 12 months, amortization expense was $341 million or about 3% of revenue.","And as we said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide strong cash returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, TI paid $309 million in dividends and repurchased $721 million of our stock. Our capital management strategy is it to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what we need to repay debt. In the second quarter, we reduced our debt level by $500 million. We also benefit from proceeds from employee stock option exercises that have allowed us to return more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders while maintaining our targeted level of cash.","For the past 12 months, we have paid $971 million in dividends or 34% of our free cash flow. Similarly, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or 90% of our free cash flow. In total, we returned 123% of free cash flow in the past 12 months.","Fundamental to our cash returns strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.24 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders grew 6% sequentially, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 as our backlog expanded again this quarter.","Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.35 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase about 6% sequentially despite our assumption that revenue from our legacy wireless products would decline by about $90 million in the quarter. For the rest of our revenue, that would result in growth of about 9% of the middle of our range.","This quarter, I'll provide some additional detail to our outlook than what we typically provide. This is in consideration of the unusual items in our second quarter and to help baseline your models. We expect operating expense in the third quarter to decline a couple of percent compared with the second quarter. The combination of our acquisition charges line and our restructuring charges line should be about $100 million in the quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.57.","In the third quarter, investors will see for the first time the Analog and Embedded Processing company that we've been building over the past years without the distraction of the Wireless business we've been unwinding. Legacy wireless revenue should be less than 2% of total TI revenue in the third quarter. Even with depreciation levels continuing well above our capital spending, we expect gross margin to, again, move up notably in the quarter and we expect to produce ongoing strong free cash flow in the years ahead that results from this business model.","For the year, our estimate for R&D expense is unchanged at $1.5 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures remains $500 million, well below our depreciation estimate of $900 million. Our estimated effective tax rate is revised up to 24% from our prior estimate of 22% as a result of our higher 2013 profit forecast.","In summary, we are seeing our company develop into what we've planned. Our business, focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, is highly diverse across customers and markets. Therefore, we believe TI can deliver more stable growth in the years ahead with the business model that delivers good profitability and low capital intensity. As a result, free cash flow should continue to be strong, $0.20 to $0.25 for every dollar of revenue. This will allow us to provide a rare combination of growth and high cash returns to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] At this time, we'll take a question from Glen Yeung.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Kevin, can you walk us through the gross margin expectations for the third quarter? Just what are the puts and takes on how you get to what I think you called notable gross margin improvement in that quarter?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Glen, I think what you're going to see with legacy wireless declining by about $90 million next quarter, that lower-margin revenue is going to be displaced by higher-margin revenue with the form of Analog and Embedded Processing to get the bigger piece. In addition, with our growing backlog and a higher revenue expectations for the quarter, we'll be utilizing more of our factory capacity. So as you kind of run through all that, I talked a moment ago about our operating expenditures, we'd expect to be down a couple of percent over -- quarter-over-quarter and restructuring and acquisition costs to be about $100 million in the quarter. So you squeeze that math on through and you'll see that our gross profit margin will continue to increase, as it has this last quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, Glen?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I do have a follow-on. If I look at your -- and forgive me if I'm doing this math wrong, but I think I got it right. If I look at your revenues less Wireless year-on-year in the June quarter, it was still actually a negative number. And I think based on your guidance, it will be positive in the third quarter. Question is do you think that your revenues, less Wireless, will actually be positive for the year?","Ron Slaymaker","Oh, Glen. I don't -- I'll let you try to extrapolate what we've done year-to-date out and into the fourth quarter. Clearly, with the legacy wireless down as significantly as it will be in the third quarter, and we've said before that we expect it to be pretty much 0 by the time we get into 2014, that variable was pretty much filled in for fourth quarter. But you can make some estimates on what the rest of the revenue could look like to make the assessment of whether we're going to be up overall without legacy wireless.","Operator","We'll take a question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Hey, Ron. First, if I could just add, the improvement that we're seeing across the industry in the comms business early stages, can you offer some perspective on that and how long do you think that could potentially last? What the puts and takes there would be?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, and I think you're talking specifically about infrastructure there, so at least that's what my comments will be. I -- we've actually seen pretty broad growth across geographies. It is being led by North America and it's being led by some of the players that late last year, in terms of operators, announced that they would be doing capital spending increases this year. So after several quarters of what I'll say is not a lot of activity, we did see real results in third quarter. But again, it was broader than North America. Looking into the back half of the year, I think we're still optimistic that -- well, actually, first of all, let me say that what we're seeing in North America is a combination of continued WCDMA deployment but also accelerating LTE deployments as well. So again, as you know, we play quite strongly across both the new LTE technology as well as the more entrenched WCDMA, so we're seeing strength on the combination. In terms of China, we, like many other people, are waiting to see the impact of -- and whether in fact we'll see second half deployments. But clearly, that's our expectation. We've seen some activity more so from the standpoint of customers getting prepped for that in Japan. But we haven't actually seen the bear [ph] left, and I think that's pretty much consistent with at least my understanding of what other players have been describing as well there. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And I apologize if I missed this because I got cut off briefly. But did you say that your plans for factory loading is going to be for the back half of the year compared to the first half?","Kevin P. March","Jim, if I heard your question correctly, I think you're asking what our plans were for factory loading in the back half of the year versus the first half. Clearly, our loadings have been stepping up. Second quarter was higher than first, and we would expect third quarter to be higher than second on the basis of our growing backlog. Beyond that, we don't have enough visibility to really comment on what the fourth quarter might look like. And so we'll wait another 60 to 90 days before we comment on that. Okay, Jim, thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question on -- first on profitability. You have Analog and Embedded Processing today pretty close to historical highs. I think Analog may be high, historical highs. Embedded processing is close. Profitability, though, looks a little bit pressured though, even with less OpEx and higher gross margins this quarter. I assume that's going to get better next quarter as margins go up and OpEx come down a little bit. But could you give us some -- I guess, a little more color on how you see profitability by your business kind of trending as we go forward to the year and maybe even share anything around longer-term targets that you might want to give us?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Stacy, I'd begin by reminding you that, especially if you look at -- compare us to prior, certainly compare us year-over-year, the profitability in those 2 segments are going to be somewhat pressured by the -- typically by virtue of the fact that we've eliminated the Wireless segment. And so that means the remaining corporate expense is spread over fewer business units. And so therefore, the corporate allocations are higher. So that alone is going to be depressed in any comparisons to prior periods. The other thing, I guess, I talked about on the Embedded Processing, you may recall that about 2 years ago, we significantly began to step up the investments that we had in that area, especially in support of our objectives for our microcontroller products. And as I mentioned on last quarter's call, those investments are at a sufficient level now that they don't not -- they do not need to be increased anymore. So we're at the point now where we're really looking for revenue growth in the Embedded Processing segment to begin to generate some real profit. You may also recall that one of our more profitable pieces of that is in the comms infrastructure. And to the question we had just a moment ago, we're beginning to see some signs of that picking up this past quarter. And ideally, that continues and that generates quite a bit of additional profit fall-through as well. Did I answer your question here, Stacy?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","No, you did. That's very helpful.","Ron Slaymaker","If I can just add one thing, I think if you look at the same thing at the company level and just try to go back and leap when we just kind of went back and looked at versus prior periods in history, you can find, at least compared with the second quarter, historical periods where revenue was similar but margins, maybe, were a little higher or whatever. And as we thought to that, a lot of that really just comes down to the difference in capacity. So for example, I think one of the ones, if I remember right, was late in 2009 when we were absolutely capacity-constrained. And if you look at where we are today and our position to be able to support growth and provide service levels that our customers expect from us based upon the capacity we have, it's just really a world of difference. So we like where we are right now and we like how things are headed into the third quarter on that front as well. Do you have a follow-on?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I do. Along those lines, around the gross margin for next quarter, my math suggests you may be implicitly guiding to a margin of 54%, maybe even a little more. I guess can you give me some feeling whether or not that math is accurate and some feeling of the relative magnitudes of drivers? We have Wireless mix obviously going down, mix of investment is maybe going up, utilization going up. I think you also have some fab closures, the 6-inch fabs that start to hit in Q3, if I'm not mistaken. Can you give us some, I guess, some feeling to the relative magnitude of some of those drivers? I'd appreciate it.","Kevin P. March","Stacy, you did a good job citing the answer I would have given you to that question as to what's driving that increase in gross profit margins. You're exactly right on those points. We're probably seeing utilization with the mix improving quite a bit, and we're beginning to see the early signs. Third on that list will be some of the savings from the closure of those 2 older 6-inch factories that we talked about. But I think that it's probably a toss-up between mix and improved utilization that we see going on there. And I think as we move forward after that, it's really going to be -- mix is going to be impacting favorably our gross margins as we keep moving forward. Okay, Stacy. Thanks for your questions.","Operator","Next question will be from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It looks to me like you're guiding your core business, like you said, Ron, up about 9%, about double normal seasonality. Could you give us any color on either the product segments or the end markets that are driving that 2x normal seasonality, please?","Ron Slaymaker","Ross, I really don't -- as is normally our practice, I don't really want to try to dissect it by end market or by product line beyond what we've identified typically. I think seasonally, we see a little additional lift from calculators and no different this time, but that's not a big factor. Probably the biggest single swing factor will be what we described already in terms of the decline for legacy wireless and, of course, that would depress from that 9% to the total amount for the company. But beyond that, we really -- I would say probably more of what we've seen in third -- in second quarter, but also I think some of the areas that were still not really lifting in second quarter and maybe holding back growth even in second quarter, seasonally, typically are stronger in third quarter. And so beyond just noting that some of the computing and handset areas see seasonal strength in third quarter, let me just kind of stop there if I can. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, and hopefully get a little closer with this one. When you talk about the OpEx side, Kevin, your color was great for the third quarter and for the full year. How should we think -- when you get to that normalized OpEx level for TI and all the cost savings, et cetera, are gone, how should we think about the growth rate in OpEx versus whatever we assume core growth in revenues would be going forward into 2014, et cetera?","Kevin P. March","Well, the kind of the high level OpEx guidelines that we have offered to the investor community is that we would expect to be operating with OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenues. I mean, clearly, what that would mean is that in periods of lower revenue, we'll be higher percent. In periods of higher revenue, lower percent. More specifically to your question as to cost trends, as I've mentioned earlier, we stepped up investment quite a bit over the last couple of years, mainly in the microcontroller portion of Embedded Processing and also in the overall sales footprint that we have on a global basis. I would expect as we look out over the next year to 2 years that, that rate of investment increase is going to slow down considerably as we begin to get revenue leverage off of that investment. So as we look forward, I would expect revenue growth to probably pretty -- provided we've got growing markets and a growing global economy, I would expect revenue growth to outstrip our OpEx growth by a fairly sizable portion. Beyond that, I won't be any more specific. But I think that you can really take that to say as we expect our overall bottom line results to continue to improve as you've seen these last few quarters. Okay, thank you, Ross.","Operator","We'll move to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ron, in your prepared comments, you talked about SVA gaining share in the June quarter. I'm just kind of curious, given the core business expectations of kind of high-single-digit sequential growth, to what extent do you think this is share gain versus what you're seeing in the overall market? And I'm being kind of curious, if industrial and auto really drove Q3, do we expect sort of the consumer market with normal seasonality to be a bigger driver in the core business for Q -- for September, sorry?","Ron Slaymaker","I think, first of all, your comment on SVA, it did gain share in Q2. But I also said it gained share in Q1, as well as in Q4. So for the last 3 quarters, it has gained market share. I think, probably, what we would expect in Q3, very likely given that we've been gaining share, we would expect to continue to gain share in Q3 but, John, until everybody comes out with their Q3 guidance, maybe more importantly when they actually come out with actual results, we're just speculating about market share. I think it's what you said. It's probably more continued strength in the industrial and automotive areas, as well as some broadening of strength into other areas. And I think you've probably heard from multiple companies reporting now, as well as what we said, and there are certain players in the handset market that were running relatively weaker demand in Q2. And probably a lot of that had to do with some -- resetting some inventory levels in their channels, that our expectation is we'll see that strengthen back up about to, I'll call it more normalized run rates for those players in addition to the seasonal lift that comes along in the third quarter. Do you have a follow-on, John?","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, just a follow-on for Kevin. Kevin, I guess as we think about the new business model, you guys in the past kind of a target gross\/op margin of, I believe, 55% and 30%. If you look at the implied guidance for the September quarter, you're basically a stone's throw away from those numbers. Kind of curious, as Wireless goes to 0 and you start to see continued leverage in the business model, should we start to be thinking about just structurally higher target growth in op margins than you've given out in the past?","Kevin P. March","John, we gave those kind of guidelines a number of years ago when we made the decision to discontinue further investment in our baseband portfolio so that we could at least give the analyst community and investors a sense as to what to expect this portfolio to be able to do. And clearly, we're beginning to see those results play themselves out. What we have talked about here in the last few quarters, in fact, even started talking about probably a year, 1.5 years ago at our analyst meeting is really a focus on cash flow. And what I would really tell you to think about is in terms of what our objectives are is to be converting 20% to 25% of our revenue into free cash flow, which, as you've heard us mention several times now, we intend to return 100% to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks less any amount that we have to use for debt repayment. So that's sort of the bottom line is our cash flow objective on this. And I expect that the actual margins in vehicle, they will fall out, they will be richer than we've historically had in the past just by virtue of the construct of our portfolio. But I won't try to offer any new numbers as to what we think target numbers are on those because we really don't want to set ourselves at that kind of limit. We're really aiming at maximizing free cash flow for our shareholders.","Ron Slaymaker","So, John, since that was your follow-up question, I don't believe you're on the line. Let me ask and, in fact, answer the natural follow-up to your follow-up, which is, okay, so with free cash flow margin objectives of 20% to 25% and just reporting 24% for the trailing 12-month period, are those objectives, in fact, something that should be reviewed? And I guess the way we look at that -- now, I'm going to answer part of the -- of your question. The way we look at that is that at current levels, we're now operating in the top 15th -- 1-5, top 15th percentile of the S&P 500. And that really just reflects the strength of our business model. And so do we -- is 20% to 25% the right number going forward? The way we will evaluate that is if we get to the point where we're consistently performing above that level, we'll then consider whether we should change the range, but right now, our margin objective as a corporation is to convert 20% to 25% of revenue to free cash flow, as Kevin said. So, John, thanks for those great questions.","Operator","At this time, we'll go to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk about the linearity of bookings during the quarter? And then considering how the product mix and market mix has changed, what should we be thinking about for normal seasonality for Q4?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. So the linearity question, the answer is probably pretty similar to what it normally is, which is orders were noisy in the quarter. You can't look at it month-to-month and try to draw any straight line in one direction or the other. It probably was a little bit even more so this quarter, Chris, because you noted we said that customers were giving us more extended visibility. And so depending upon when those customers chose to load up in terms of the backlog for the out-quarter, that drove some of the noisiness. So it was a little more so than normal, and I'll give you one example. Comm's infrastructure had an especially strong May, and that was exactly what I was describing. They were going from -- I don't know their exact numbers but let's say they had 3 months of visibility on our backlog placed then they were pushing out to 4, 4.5 months, that pretty much got loaded in during the month of May and created some of the noisiness. So there was some of that stuff going on. I don't know in terms of, with all the changes in our portfolio, whether that's going to translate to anything different for Q4, Chris. I think we've kind of just have to move forward. We're probably -- given the breadth of Analog and Embedded Processing, you can probably just go look at more industry numbers and try to assess. Clearly, Q3, if you just look at average growth, has historically 5-year average been 5%. Again, we always give the caution, the range on that is huge. It was 0% to 17%. I'm not sure how useful that amount, that 5% number is. Fourth quarter is down more so. In fact, if you just look at the average, it's down 8%. I think that is a completely not useful number because of the noise that fourth quarter '08, I believe it was, introduced into that, where we had a down 26% quarter. The high point on that is down to like, I think -- I'm sorry, the range was minus 26% to plus 4%. I think kind of got what a normal Q4 is probably down a little bit because semiconductor products probably tend to move more sideways in that Q4 type of time period. And then you probably have some -- the pressure of calculators coming off of their back-to-school peak in Q3 pushing down into Q4. But that's clearly not evident in the average 5-year growth rate numbers that I just gave you. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Can you just maybe give us a sense of what the inventory did during the quarter and how their bookings pattern is? Is there any commentary you're hearing from them?","Ron Slaymaker","I don't have bookings. I think we said in prepared remarks that the inventory declined and yet -- so that actually, at an absolute dollar basis, went down to a little under 5.5 weeks -- I'm sorry, let me start that over. From a -- an absolute dollar standpoint, distributor inventory was stable. From a days, it went down about 1 day to below 5.5 weeks in the quarter. Okay, Chris. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Ron, and this is not a follow-up to any follow-up, but it's a follow-up to your prepared remarks. Clarification on the connectivity, who did you sell it to? And then I'm assuming this includes only the handset-related business and not the embedded part.","Kevin P. March","Ambrish, we won't disclose who it was we entered into that transaction with. I would just mention again, it was further efforts on our part to try to monetize those prior investments in that technology. What we transferred was their -- a right for that buyer to use that technology, including some tangible deliverables that we provided to that particular buyer. It's a nonexclusive arrangement. It allows us to fully use the technology just as we have in the past, and importantly to continue to pursue the market strategies that we have for that, which was really to take that technology into places where it's beginning to emerge in the -- I think, the common term is the Internet of Things, but to more and more different areas where we're finding wireless connectivity kind of technology being useful and emerging.","Ron Slaymaker","But think of it more along the lines of the legacy wireless as opposed to the Embedded business. So we don't believe this will have any impact, you might say, on our embedded opportunity going forward. Again, it's just means by which we're continuing to monetize that legacy wireless business. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I did, on the core business, Ron and Kevin. Good to see the SVA kind of on that trajectory that you've laid out. The last couple of quarters, it's done well. Can you just help us understand -- and I don't mean to make light of it because market share gains are never easy. But was it just blocking and tackling stuff or -- because it couldn't be new products that have been developed since the acquisition? So just any color you could provide on what has been working would be great.","Kevin P. March","Yes, I would say, Ambrish, perhaps what you're beginning to see here, that remember that that's really -- SVA has a lot of its revenue going through the industrial channel, as well as the automotive and clearly, those markets have been doing well. But importantly, the industrial, it means a lot of customers, including a lot of small customers. And that's where the benefit of an extremely large sales force plays in versus what national could have done on its own in the past. We simply didn't have the sales force scale to be able to reach out to as many customers. So I think the combination of nice growth in the markets in which it's in and the fact that we're able to get that products out to a lot more customers in those spaces are coming together to help us see some nice growth in that. And then overall, that's just better commercial terms with customers. You may recall that they had previously gotten themselves into a little bit of hot water with some customers where they were no longer welcome on designs. And we've been welcomed back in. And those -- some of those designs are, in fact, already beginning to turn into -- some of those all already turning into incremental revenue.","Ron Slaymaker","But let me just add, Ambrish, you recall that when we announced that acquisition, we said the entire basis on which we're going to generate a return on this acquisition is based on revenue synergies that we thought possible, not really cost synergies. I mean, there were some cost synergies, but they were minor compared to the revenue synergies that we thought were possible through our combination. So it's absolutely -- I'll understate it and call it encouraging to see those revenue synergies coming through, coming through at the rate they are and on the timeline they are. So really good news from our perspective there. Okay, Ambrish. Thank you for your questions.","Operator","At this time, we'll go to Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Hey, Kevin or Ron, just one question on the underutilization charges. What were they in the second quarter and what do you project that number to be in the third quarter?","Kevin P. March","Sumit, we haven't been providing a projection on that, but they were a little bit less than $100 million in the quarter...","Ron Slaymaker","And downsized. As we said, that was beneficial to TI last quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Sumit?","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I do. Just a clarification again. You said that dollar inventories were roughly flat in distribution, down on a days\u2019 basis. And -- but you said resales are up 5%, but your organic business grew 8%. Just trying to understand what sort of the -- how do I reconcile all of that? In other words, the organic business being up 8%, but your resales being up only 5%, but inventories being flat?","Ron Slaymaker","I think obviously, this is just different cross currents in distribution and that customer base than what we have overall and what we have associated with our direct business. So I wouldn't -- I mean, I think we clearly understand it. But I guess I would say it's really just to be very customer-specific in terms of -- I think what you're really asking is why were resales growing slower than TI's revenue overall. And I would just say it tends to get customer-specific that I don't want to get into. Also keep in mind, our overall business benefits from the lift that we see in calculators. And again, that would be TI revenue as opposed to the resales and then also some of the market-specific things. But again, it gets somewhat market-specific but also customer-specific there. Okay, Sumit. Thank you for your questions.","Operator","And we'll move along to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Kevin, on the prepaid, it was about a $300 million use of cash due to the, my understanding, I guess it's a tech transfer. So does that reverse and unwind? Has that become a source of cash? And could you just go through the accounting mechanics on that?","Kevin P. March","Sure, Mark. The way that works is as we have met the requirements of the agreement that we signed late in the quarter, it was a recognizable event. And therefore, it was recognized into earnings. The payment terms were such that we don't expect to get paid on the majority of that until this quarter. So in fact, exactly what you said is what'll occur, it -- because it's in net income, it's taken out on the prepaid line and other assets, so that appears to be a use of cash. And in fact, it will reverse itself when we move into the third quarter because we, in fact, had already received the payment that was due in the third quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, Mark?","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And a simple question. The -- so when your dollars of distributed inventories are flat, does that mean your resales equal your sell-in?","Ron Slaymaker","When dollars are flat, does that mean resales equal sell-in? Not necessarily, because it depends upon what distributor was -- the distributors were doing with inventory in the prior quarter. So for example, if -- you just have to play with the numbers. But if they were reducing inventory one quarter, they held that inventory flat the next quarter, you could see resales trend -- resale growth trend well below our revenue growth as revenue, kind of call it snapped back to the way it was shipping out. But there's not always a direct -- what do I say, there's not always a direct alignment between revenue growth or shipment into distribution and what they're shipping out because it varies based on what they've been doing in terms of adding or depleting inventory. And clearly, with us having customers -- I'm sorry, distributors converting to consignment, that can impact us as well because the impact of a consignment conversion is the -- is basically they're depleting inventory and depleting at a lesser rate as we go forward.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So, Ron, so just -- and I apologize if I missed this, so what were resales versus sell-in?","Ron Slaymaker","I don't know. I had resales about -- let's see. We said resales were up 3% (sic) [5%] . Off the top of my head, I don't have -- I don't -- I have sell-in, actually it was up just slightly more in that a couple of points more than that is what it looks like. Okay, thank you, Mark.","Operator","And moving forward, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Any notable changes in lead times and anything that you might -- that you think might probably trend higher in the back half of the year?","Ron Slaymaker","Lead times, I would say generally pretty stable with the vast majority of our products shipping in less than 6 weeks. So no real change there, Joe. Do you have a follow-on?","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, and if there's any color you can give us on end market dynamics and the stuff you've mentioned in terms of computing or automotive or anything like that.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. I have a couple of comments here. So industrial, I guess, you've -- we've seen from what we're saying already, that market continues to recover. I would say in general, customers in that space are pretty hand to mouth. They're keeping inventories lean. We have not seen signs of any kind of broad replenishment there. And lead times for our products there are short and they're taking advantage of that. In terms of automotive, we've -- you've heard us say our revenue was strong. That goes across both Analog, as well as Embedded Processing. Part of that is clearly the market, the end market is strong. Part of it is TI is benefiting from design wins really in a couple of areas. One is the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, as well as infotainment. We're also seeing new opportunities in a couple of areas, advanced radar systems. You've seen, for example, that partly the drivers there, such as blind spot detection. But we're seeing radar technology in automobiles start to get deployed much broader than just certainly [ph] considerations, much broader than just blind spot detection. Computing, no surprise there. The news flash is the overall PC market has been weak, continues to be weak. We'll see what happens when some of the new processors get introduced here in the second half, but that space has been weak. Comms infrastructure, I think I've pretty much said what I can say about that. Communications or handsets rather, the probably -- the big story for TI is just ongoing declines in legacy wireless. I think we're actually doing pretty well in the broader handset market with some of the other products we have, like audio amplifiers, et cetera. But if you just look at that market overall, it's getting, for TI, swamped out by what's happening at certain customers in terms of their own adjustments, but then also our legacy wireless trends. And then the consumer, I would just say that game consoles were weak last quarter as we have manufacturers in that space preparing for new product introductions and transitions here in the second half. Television, I would describe as generally weak. I think there's new technologies that are being introduced that hold some promise for growth there. But overall, I would say the market is weak. And that's about it. So all right, Joe. Thank you for your questions.","Operator","And we'll move along to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to address this demand environment question I think being asked in different ways from a geographic perspective. How much of the growth that you're seeing right now is U.S. centric versus, say, coming from China and Europe? Because the macro data points from China and Europe are still quite mixed. So if you could just get us -- give us a sense of how demand is from a geographic perspective?","Ron Slaymaker","So let me just give you the data and then I'll let you figure out how to interpret it. But if you look at our revenue in the second quarter, we saw the highest growth, and this was just on a dollar basis, out of Asia, followed by the U.S., followed by Japan. Europe was down what I would characterize as little, meaning a couple of percent. But all regions were up. Asia was the strongest from a dollar standpoint, but it's also where -- over what, 60%, 65% of our revenue is shipping these days. And then U.S. was the strongest in terms of percentage growth, but it's much smaller than what Asia is for us. And then the only caution to that, that I always attach to that is you have to be a little careful. I mean, Asia is where a lot products are being manufactured and then turned around and shipped back to other markets such as the U.S. for consumption. So it's not a statement about economic conditions or changes there in those markets, it's strictly a matter of our customers manufacturing in those various regions. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Thanks, Ron. Just as a clarification, what percentage of the sales now are dist versus direct? And then within that, if you could give us a split of sell-in versus sell-through?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. So 55% of our revenue goes to distribution now. If you look at that distribution revenue, about 50% of that is now supported by consignment. So as a proxy for your sell-in versus sell-out, officially and technically, we're on sell-in recognition with distribution. But the half of the revenue that's on consignment behaves like sell-out in that the distributors' revenue doesn't get recognized until they pull it out of that consignment hardware, out of that consignment inventory to then directly ship it to a customer. So it behaves like sell-out. Just more broadly, about 45% of our overall revenue now is supported by consignment and\/or JIT programs. And so if you kind of put all that together, that means that only about 1\/4 of our revenue is not on consignment or on -- or in distribution. The reason I point out is because where we have consignment, we have really good visibility into that customer's or distributor's TI inventory levels. And, in fact, for distributors more broadly, even where they're not on consignment, we know what their TI inventory is. So the point being, for about 75% of our, I'll call revenue coverage, we have pretty good insight into inventories. And when we characterize them as lean or well-managed, I guess, is maybe a different word to think of as of now, we do that with pretty direct visibility. The 25% that's not on consignment or not a distribution, we have the same kind of visibility as any supplier where that's on a normal backlog where you talk to customers, but we're not seeing it directly. But for 75%, we have good visibility and we feel good about where inventories are right now in our channels and that our customers. Okay, Vivek. Thank you for your questions.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a question about some of the extended visibility you said your customers are providing to you. With the lead times not really changed, why do you think the customers are giving you that extended visibility? I guess is it just as simple as they're feeling more confident about the business in the second half? Could you give a little more color on that?","Ron Slaymaker","I think it's a combination of things. I think that's part of it. So as they get more comfortable with their own forecast and their own outlook, they are -- they're more comfortable putting, call it commitment that's associated with backlog on their suppliers. So I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it, and I don't know how to weigh one versus the other is that frankly, I think TI's or some of TI's competitors are out talking to customers, kind of signaling potential upcoming lead time extensions. And when that happens, the customers, for their own benefit, go ahead and try to get backlog placed. And typically, when they do that, they don't just place backlog where they think lead times are going out. They're going to place backlog for full system. And so they're -- we're seeing some of that as well. So I think, again, some of it is customers -- I'm sorry, competitor-induced where they're concerned about their ability to support the full customer demand and their capacity situation, and then the other part of it is just customers' increased confidence in their own demand for their own products. Okay, Chris. Do you have a follow-on?","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. And I guess just following up on that, and I guess to the extent that you have the visibility, do you see the customers and distributors wanting to put on a little more inventory as we go through the holiday season and, again, realizing that your capacity utilization is still probably a lot lower than your competitors, I guess you would see that as an opportunity to kind of pick up some market share there?","Ron Slaymaker","Again, I don't know that -- there's probably some natural inventory that goes along with getting ready for a seasonal holiday build. I don't know at this point that I would just try to distinguish between just higher demand versus inventory replenishment, especially where we have consignment. As I said for distribution, that's 75% of our revenue inventory build of TI chips. Now that's not reflecting us anything about the customers' end product inventory situation. But inventory of TI chips, there is no thing -- no such thing. Basically, we manage the consignment inventory to a certain turns level, so we take responsibility for that. Okay, Chris. Thank you for your questions.","Operator","This question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My first question is on CapEx. I know in the past, you talked about having sufficient capacity right now to get to about $18 billion in revenue, meaning keeping the CapEx level pretty low. But is it safe to say that $97 million here this quarter is sort of the low for at least the near term?","Kevin P. March","Tore, we are still holding our forecast for the year at about $500 million. We, as you pointed out, spent $97 million this quarter and we spent about $84 million last quarter. You may recall that we did announce that we were acquiring an assembly test site in Chengdu, China. And, of course, that will require some cash in the second half for us to go ahead and close on that transaction. But I expect that we'll still stay in our $500 million, inside that overall budget for the year. And then going forward, again, for modeling purposes, I would expect us to be at above 4% of revenues going into CapEx, up to $18 billion of revenue, at which point in time, that may change. Although I would also point out, it is our objective to keep watching for inexpensive capacity and to the extent that we can get that and extend that $18 billion ceiling for variable prices, we will be very opportunistic and open to that strategy.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, Tore. Do you have follow-on question?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, just one follow-up. I know this is a segment that you didn't discuss much on this call but it's certainly a high-profile segment. But the Analog business that sell into smartphones and tablets, could you talk a little bit about how that's faring in the current environment, please?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. I guess what I would say is from a -- just even in things like I probably mentioned mid-quarter and I probably might have mentioned earlier in this call, in areas like audio amplifiers, relatively low-profile devices, we don't -- they don't get headlined a lot or whatever, but we have a pretty strong and broad position in the handsets with those types of products. So we feel good about our progress there and position. That also being said, those markets are more vertical, they're more concentrated. And so in this kind of environment, meaning second quarter when you have big customers making inventory adjustments or whatever, they catch up that part of our business as well as all of our competitors that play into those spaces. So we did see some softness associated with that in the second quarter. The good news is, again, our exposure there is much lower than it has historically been as it is in the PC market. And so when you get those vertical markets, making those kinds of adjustments, it doesn't have the same kind of impact on TI that certainly it would have in our past. So hopefully, that answers your question.","And with that, we're going to wrap up. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","And again, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Texas Instruments\u2019 Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","David Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","I\u2019ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago; however, demand for our products slowed across most markets during the","quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago.","Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with communications equipment as the exception. In communications equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps, while Embedded products declined from a year ago, as we expected. Without the decline in communications equipment, Embedded would have grown.","With that backdrop, I\u2019ll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be","representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.","Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that\u2019s long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output.","We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.","For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.2 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion, taken together these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners.","I\u2019ll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue decreased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontrollers was about even. In our Other segment, revenue declined 6% primarily due to custom products, as we expected.","Now, I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper-single digit growth with most sectors growing year-on-year.","Automotive grew double-digits from a year ago, but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term.","Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines at others. Communications equipment increased low-single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.","In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. And these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected.","On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.","Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.","Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long-term. Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300 millimeter Analog revenue.","Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.","As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77, or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases, and over the past 5 years we have increased the quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019.","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to","$3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to non-cash charges.","To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters, and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data.","In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 15 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market, and we plan to execute as we","have in the past: First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts; however, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. Second, we will continue our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A.","There are important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages, like our demand-creation initiative, and these would remain unchanged. In other areas of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300 millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon as 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300 millimeter factory shell in place.","In conclusion, we are focused on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for a long time to come.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about drivers of gross margin in the next quarter. You mentioned a few things, you\u2019re going to reduce wafer starts but inventory days are also going to rise. You mentioned your 300-millimeter next phase is coming on, which suggests CapEx continues to be elevated so depreciation goes up. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the different drivers as we get into Q4 and how should think about those drivers evolving into 2019 and beyond as some of them are longer-term?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, Stacy, let me take that. The big picture of fall-through on our revenue is the same as it has been before. 70% to 75% is what we have talked about and that applies on going up, it also applies going down. So that\u2019s what we would expect. Of course, that is over the long haul. So any one quarter, it could be a little different. The other thing I would tell you, obviously, when we are increasing wafer starts, that is a help for gross margins and when we\u2019re decreasing wafer starts, it\u2019s a headwind on gross margins. And so you will see that and you should expect that. You have a follow-up?","Stacy Rasgon","Yes. So I guess, how do you continue to build inventory going forward if you\u2019re reducing wafer starts? How does that work?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. So it depends on how much you reduce wafer starts depending on the revenue change, right? And also it depends on the timing of that. Wafers cycle times can be anywhere between 12 to 16 weeks. It doesn\u2019t change on a dime. But the key point on keeping those, the wafer starts, at a level that even though we are reducing them, but we can still build those long-lived inventory buffers for industrial and automotive. Those are low risk buffers. Those parts live for a long, long time and they enable us to then support our customers on the other side of this slowdown. So overall, it\u2019s just a better way and a smart way to allocate our capital.","David Pahl","Yes. And I\u2019ll just add to that, Stacy, that not only will we build that strategic inventory of low-volume parts but we\u2019re also, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, moving a larger proportion of our revenues to consignment. So both of those things will put pressure on inventory. But we believe those are the right things to do long term. So thanks, Stacy. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, just relative to your comments in the prepared remarks about Embedded in the comms space, can you help us sort of quantify the size of that business now? And is that at all influencing the guide for the December quarter?","David Pahl","Okay, yes. So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we\u2019ve been talking about how we\u2019re allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we\u2019ve been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In Personal electronics, no surprise there. It\u2019s down, but it\u2019s more selective, it\u2019s not zero. We still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we\u2019ve long talked about in Embedded that we\u2019ve taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we\u2019ve actually taken it down.","The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what\u2019s new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more Analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don\u2019t change things much from a digital standpoint. So we\u2019ve got good position there that\u2019s not \u2013 that isn\u2019t something that we\u2019ve needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we\u2019re confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we\u2019re still shipping some 3G stuff.","So we are convinced that the majority of our growth is still going to come longer-term from industrial and automotive. But we\u2019ll \u2013 comms equipment will be a very good market for us for long periods of time. Do you have a follow-up, John?","John Pitzer","Dave, I guess my question specifically is, is there another shortfall in revenue coming in Embedded Comms in the calendar fourth quarter? Because it looks like it was at least, on a year-over-year basis, about $40 million in the calendar third quarter, if your comments about Embedded growing ex comms is correct, if I\u2019m doing the math right. Is that \u2013 is there more to come in the calendar fourth quarter? Or is this now behind us?","David Pahl","Yes. So last year, comms equipment was 12% of our revenues in total. And I would say that, if you have listened to the commentary, which I\u2019m sure you did, it was the one market that actually grew inside of the quarter, right? So we saw year-on-year growth in communications equipment in total even though that was not contributed by the Embedded business. So yes, those things are in our guidance going forward. I think our guidance is more influenced by the fact that we are seeing most of the markets beginning to slow versus the specifics of what\u2019s going on inside of comms equipment. So thank you, John. We\u2019ll go the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Chris Danely with Citigroup, please go ahead.","Chris Danely","Hey thanks, guys. Just a little more color maybe on the slowdown. When you talk to your customers or the distis, does it feel like things could get a little bit worse? And then maybe which \u2013 it sounds like comms looks a little bit better, which of the end markets has fallen off the most?","David Pahl","Yes, let me start and see if Rafael wants to add anything. So Chris, I think that it\u2019s always best when you enter a period like this. We just kind of stick to the facts of what we can see, what we can measure. We just turned in 4% growth year-over-year. If you take the midpoint of our guidance, revenues would be flat. So that\u2019s a different number than what we\u2019ve just delivered inside of this quarter. So where it goes from there and how long it lasts are just things that we don\u2019t know. We will be in a position with what we\u2019re doing with wafer starts. That if it\u2019s a more shallow correction, we will be prepared to support it on the other side. If it\u2019s longer lived, we will be monitoring our wafer starts on a daily basis and we know how to react in those situations.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, let me add to that and I\u2019ll just frankly just emphasize what Dave say he covered it very well already. But most end markets have slowed, that\u2019s what we know. And we believe this is mostly driven by a slowdown in semiconductors, meaning we really can\u2019t speak to any macro driven event here. As we have said before, the direct effect of the tariffs for us in any of the trade issues is minimal. It\u2019s really not there. So all we can judge is by what we see right in front of us, what our customers, the signal they send us and that\u2019s what we are basing this on.","In addition to that, as Dave said, the key thing here is what we do with the operating plan so that we put ourselves in a position so that if this is shallow, we can very quickly ramp back up and support growth. If it\u2019s not shallow, if it actually goes the other way, we are also in a position where we can make additional adjustments to just continue to do the right thing from a free cash flow standpoint and from an operating plan standpoint. On the investment side, as I said during our prepared remarks, we are not going to change anything on R&D. SG&A will be prudent and then on 300-millimeter, we\u2019re going to continue with the plans to continue expanding that, strengthening the competitive advantage.","David Pahl","Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Chris Danely","Yes. I guess, not talking about the future, but just given what\u2019s happened to you up until now. What would you attribute the cause of the slowdown? Is it just overall demand? Is it tariffs? Is it China? Is it too much inventory? Anything more specific on just the slowdown in semis? What do the customers or disties are telling you, I guess?","David Pahl","Yes, Chris, I think that kind of reiterating what Rafael said and maybe add a little color is that we believe that\u2019s mostly driven by a slowdown in the semiconductor market just after several years of strong growth. It doesn\u2019t preclude that there aren\u2019t other things and other factors, the macro things that are going on. Certainly, as the quarters evolve, those things will become more obvious of what role that they\u2019ll play. But that\u2019s where \u2013 we\u2019ll just stick to what we can see and what we know. So all right, thank you, Chris. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller.","Operator","Caller your line is open Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hey guys, thanks to let me ask a question. I guess I wanted to hit it from a lead time perspective. David, doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re going to give terribly more color on it. But if it\u2019s short lead times and your lead times haven\u2019t really changed, it seems like it would be more of a demand than an inventory perspective. So any color you could give on that? And then maybe even geographically, is there any color about one market acting differently than any of the others?","David Pahl","Yes, Ross. Let me just comment on a few of the things that we can see. And certainly, we watch all those indicators. And to kind of start with where I want to end is the best indicator that we get are orders from customers that we get directly as well as we\u2019ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment where we actually have demand fees that customers are telling us what they plan to build. And those clearly are the best signals that we can see. Our outlook will be built on that. And certainly, those indicators show that demand slowed across most of the end markets during the quarter.","And that\u2019s why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it\u2019s up slightly but it\u2019s still running at about four weeks. Cancellations are up, but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable. And it doesn\u2019t matter what period you\u2019re in, you\u2019re always going to have places where demand will be tight and we will work with customers on that. But the vast majority of products have continued to be very, very stable from a lead time standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of what we see. Regionally, I don\u2019t think when we look at our numbers, there\u2019s nothing there that we would call out, specifically. And also, just as a reminder, I know you know very well that we ship product into a particular region, it may get put into a subsystem or a system and then shipped into another region of the world. So actually, looking at our demand by regional results really doesn\u2019t give much color on what\u2019s going on from a macro standpoint. So you got a follow-on?","Ross Seymore","Yes. Just quickly, you haven\u2019t mentioned the automotive market in any short-term fashion. But that\u2019s been the market that probably has the biggest laundry list of headwinds from your customers and your customers\u2019 customers. Any color of what you\u2019re seeing in aggregate or on the five sub segments within it?","David Pahl","Yes. On Automotive, growth did slow there. But as you know, we\u2019ve been growing very strongly and really for five years plus. So demand slowed but it still grew double-digits, right? So we saw that growth was broad-based. It was across the sectors. But in aggregate, it did slow as well as the demand inside of industrial. And so, okay? Well, thank you, Ross. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I wonder if you can just \u2013 I think just take one more cut at this demand question. I mean, when you guys are guiding for Q4, is the conservatism entirely just what you\u2019re seeing in your order book? And to what degree, when you see these automotive shortfalls at your customers and, to a lesser extent, industrial shortfalls of your customer, are you budgeting for that to maybe soften from where your current level of visibility is? Or is not that the way you\u2019re looking at?","Rafael Lizardi","I\u2019ll just make a quick comment and turn it over to Dave. But I wouldn\u2019t categorize or characterize that guidance as conservative. This is the best we know, based on the orders that we are getting from our customers and the best signal that we have. And that range encompasses the best of our knowledge.","David Pahl","Yes, I think that\u2019s well said. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?","Joe Moore","Yes, sure. I mean, do you have a sense for, when you look at your third quarter, do you think your customers built inventory? And did you see any people building ahead to get ahead of tariffs, either the 10% or the 25% tariff? Just any indications that your inventories may have built and that some element of this is softening? Is inventory declining in Q4? Just how are you thinking about those inventory levels?","David Pahl","Yes. I\u2019ll point out or I\u2019ll just remind you, Joe, because I know you know, we\u2019ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment. So for that revenue, there isn\u2019t an inventory buffer at our customers that are in front of that. The demand that we\u2019re seeing is the actual \u2013 is close to the factory order builds as you\u2019re going to get. Our visibility ends there, right? So their demand downstream and downstream into their kennels, of course we have no visibility on that front. So we are fairly early in the announcement schedule and lineup. And so we will find out where that \u2013 if there is inventory out there as more companies report. So thank you very much. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of America \u2013 sorry with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Lastly checks to BMO, thank you.","David Pahl","Never know.","Ambrish Srivastava","Never know. I\u2019m sure Vivek is there on the line as well, sorry, Vivek. You\u2019re safe, buddy. So just, Dave, on the demand side, I just wanted to \u2013 you guys have been to several sectors. I just wanted to make sure and you\u2019re correctly calling out that you\u2019re telling us what you\u2019re seeing on the fact space. But then these metrics like cancellations or debookings or what have you, is there a rate of change that you look at and say that you can give us any perspective on how deep it\u2019s going to be or what kind of duration this would turn into?","Rafael Lizardi","I\u2019ll take a shot at that. And Dave, you want to add to that. But frankly, no, we \u2013 as Dave said, we have \u2013 the visibility that we have is to the consignment inventory that\u2019s in front of us. And by the way, that is inventory that is still in our books. So we haven\u2019t recognized revenue for that. So that\u2019s one advantage of having that consignment, that inventory like that. And so that\u2019s the data point we have and we use that to forecast the next quarter\u2019s revenue. And the other data point is what Dave already mentioned, right, cancellations. They\u2019re up slightly but they continue at low levels and our lead times have remained stable.","David Pahl","Yes. And I\u2019ll just say, things like distributor inventory, Ambrish, I\u2019ll point out, it\u2019s still around four weeks. That\u2019s half to a third of what many of our peers run with distributor inventory. And as we implement these next phases, that number structurally will continue to come down over time. So now that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to see cycles in those types of impact. And even with consignment inventory, we have as good a visibility as you can get of what our customers are going to build. But never confuse high visibility with \u2013 that, that number can\u2019t change and change quickly. So \u2013 but we know about it as soon the customers plan to do something and something different.","Rafael Lizardi","And let me add a little bit to that. On that next phase of consignment that we talked about, as Dave just mentioned, that\u2019s going to take those distribution inventory weeks, from about four to maybe about three over the next year or so. That did put some headwind on our third quarter revenue of about $20 million. And it is probably going to put \u2013 it is putting another $50 million or so to our fourth quarter revenue. That is incorporated of course in our guide. Of course, that is a small part of what\u2019s going on here. As we\u2019ve said, most of our markets have slowed down and that\u2019s the main driver of the guidance that we\u2019re giving.","David Pahl","Great. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes, I did, and that was helpful. What was the book-to-bill for the quarter?","David Pahl","Our book-to-bill, I knew you would ask that question. It is 0.96 in the quarter. And as I always give that number, I have to \u2013 for those who don\u2019t follow us and talk about the consignment programs, we don\u2019t carry any orders for that demand. And so book-to-bill, just be careful with the number, use it in the safety of your home. So with that, we\u2019ll move onto next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Pahl","Hey, Vivek.","Vivek Arya","Thank you. Yes.","David Pahl","Are you still there?","Vivek Arya","Glad I\u2019m still here. So when I look at the last two downturns that you guys went through, and I\u2019m just focusing on the core Analog and Embedded business, and I\u2019m talking about say the first half of 2013 or late 2015, they kind of lasted for two quarters, and then you saw your core Analog and Embedded business start to then start to grow year-on-year. I know you don\u2019t want to say anything about the future. But if you were to just help us contrast the customer behavior and the signals that you\u2019re seeing now versus what you saw in those downturns, is there anything that stands out, positive or negative?","David Pahl","Yes, I\u2019d start that as we look at those, and we all look at industry data. As we went through those other downturns, the ups weren\u2019t very strong and therefore the downs weren\u2019t very strong, right? And I think we\u2019ve just described those as we\u2019ve moved through them. It\u2019s just operating in a world that really have low economic growth, right? So the last couple of years, certainly, we\u2019ve had much stronger upturn in the economy overall. The economic growth has been stronger over the last couple of years. So that\u2019s certainly different. I think that our business has continued to evolve. We have more industrial, more automotive business.","We are continuing to invest and ensure that, that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we\u2019ve continued to invest in our 300-millimeter Analog footprint and grow. So we\u2019ve got that going into the numbers. So \u2013 and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we\u2019re generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue, 37.5%. Those are good, strong numbers. And I think that those are the things that give us confidence to continue to make the investments, to make the business stronger, investing in the competitive advantages. Markets will strengthen and weaken over periods of time. But we continue to stay focused on our opportunity.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, let me comment on that. So yes, to Dave\u2019s point, we have demonstrated for a number of years now the strength of the business model. And that\u2019s through ups and now, downs. And the right thing to do, what we will continue to have done and what we will continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantages so that we continue to become stronger. One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at the next tranche of capacity. So we are exploring options for our next 300-millimeter factory.","And we\u2019ll likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we\u2019ll do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx \u2013 as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it\u2019s already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%.","And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years. So I want you, Vivek, to consider that and think about that. So that will be \u2013 that\u2019s how we are looking at it and how we are planning the next tranche of capacity. Do you have another question?","Vivek Arya","Yes, thanks for that information. The next question is on buybacks. You bought back $1.2 billion, right. You\u2019ve been very active in buybacks. So with the trailing 12 months, you still have, I believe you said $18.2 billion left. The stock is down 25% from its highs. Is it fair to assume that you can be more aggressive on buyback to take advantage of the stock price? Or in general, how do you think about when to be more aggressive with your buybacks? Thank you.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. First, let me take a step back, what is the objective here? And the objective was to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. So the last 12 months, we generated $5.9 billion of free cash flow. And then we returned $6. 2 billion. So we\u2019ve returned virtually the same thing that we have generated. So that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve done for a number of years. And we will continue to do that. Can we, on the margin, do a little bit more here and there? We could and \u2013 but the big picture is that we would return all free cash flow to the owners of the company.","David Pahl","Okay, thank you very much. And I think we have time for one more caller.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes, thank you. And congratulations on that Analog operating margins, that\u2019s pretty impressive. First question, your SG&A was down quite a bit sequentially. It\u2019s now below 10%. Is that going to be sort of the rate that we should consider going forward? And does that kind of already incorporate you managing the OpEx a bit more conservatively?","Rafael Lizardi","What I would tell you, we think of OpEx in general, not just SG&A, but OpEx and SG&A and R&D as investments. Not everything there, but certainly, all of R&D is an investment and part of SG&A \u2013 that\u2019s part of SG&A. And that is to drive growth in revenue and free cash flow over the long-term. And that\u2019s how we view that. We suggest you also look at it that way and then it\u2019s easier to then look at it on a trailing 12-month basis. It gets some of the quarter-to-quarter transitions out of the way. That can be a little noisy.","So on that basis, OpEx is up about 2% versus the same time period last quarter \u2013 or last year, I\u2019m sorry. And that is a good expectation of how that number should trail. The other thing that I would point to is that SG&A in particular in third quarter was down in part because of our CEO transition. Do you have a follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yes, Rafael, that\u2019s very helpful. My follow-up is on inventory days. So I completely get it and I understand the new consignment plan. But how high are you willing to let the inventory days go given the structural change?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics. But I\u2019ll frame it this way. One, as I said, it will likely go above the range. So right now, the range is 115 to 145. So it will likely go above 145. We think like owners. So to me, to us, that is a use of cash, right? So I feel compelled to use that cash for inventory because I think it\u2019s a good return on that investment because it\u2019s going to help us on the other side of our recovery. And as I said, it\u2019s a very low obsolescence type of inventory. But we wouldn\u2019t keep it at those levels indefinitely. If it\u2019s a long lasting slowdown, then we would take additional measures to modulate that inventory, bring it back within the range at some point in the future.","David Pahl","Okay. Thank you very much, Tore. We appreciate all of you joining us tonight. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good night.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you, all again for your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through to the web. ","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for more complete descriptions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that TI will host an Investor Meeting in New York on May 3. At this meeting, our CEO, Rich Templeton, and Kevin March, will provide an update on TI's strategy, market positions and goals. If you have not already registered, please do so as soon as possible. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 11. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. ","Let me start with the market environment. The first quarter's results landed close to our expectations and were consistent with our belief that our business cycle bottomed in the first quarter. Analog revenue was about even. We were especially encouraged by the progress we continue to make with the former National Semiconductor product line, now called Silicon Valley Analog, as it gains traction with customers and holds a strong position in the important industrial market. Early signs point to the industrial market strengthening in the near term as opposed to the delayed recovery that we saw in the last cycle. ","Embedded Processing revenue grew in the quarter, led by strength in automotive and the beginning of a recovery in communications infrastructure. In wireless, revenue fell sharply as we had expected. Baseband revenue declined to less than 3% of our first quarter revenue and we expect it to remain at very low levels throughout the remainder of 2012.","Our Other segment was up as a result of about $65 million of insurance proceeds associated with the Japan earthquake that were received in the last few days of the quarter. The proceeds were part of an ongoing settlement process with the insurance companies and were not included in our earlier guidance due to the uncertainty over their timing.","Core products were 78% of our first quarter revenue, up from 71% a year ago and 66% two years ago. As these products continued to make up a higher proportion of our revenue, our business is becoming more diversified across customers and markets. For example, in 2009, we had a single customer that made up more than 20% of TI revenue. In first quarter '12, it takes the combination of our top 6 customers to exceed 20%. We now have more than 90,000 customers and no single customer comprises more than a mid-single-digit percentage of our revenue.","We believe this expanding diversity is strong evidence that our large sales force and broad customer footprint are paving the way, not only for TI share gains, but also for results that will be determined more so by our own execution in the years ahead and not swung by the fortunes of a particular customer or a narrow market segment.","Consistent with our view that the first quarter was the bottom of our business cycle, we believe growth will resume in the second quarter. In fact, at middle of our guidance range, sequential growth would hit 10% when compared with the first quarter's results without the insurance proceeds. Supporting this forecast was order growth in the quarter of 13%, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 and our first quarterly expansion in backlog since the second quarter of 2011.","As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 0.84. We saw a broad-based order growth across the geographical regions and many of our end markets. We believe TI is very well-positioned as our markets rebound in the quarters ahead. Our product portfolio is strong and our design position with customers is excellent. Our acquisition of National Semiconductor should contribute revenue and share gains as customers across the world embrace the strength of this portfolio, combined with the attraction of TI's market channels and our customer-oriented business approach.","As you know, we have been anticipating this upturn, and as a result, we have our inventory well-staged and production in our factories ramping. Our manufacturing capacity is strong, and our teams are poised to drive growth and capture share gains as the market strengthens.","So let's walk through the specifics of the first quarter. Revenue of $3.12 billion declined 8% from a year ago and 9% sequentially, mostly due to lower wireless revenue. Analog revenue was up 10% from a year ago and was about even with the fourth quarter. Growth from the year-ago quarter was due to our acquisition of National, and therefore, the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog revenue. Sequentially, SVA revenue grew, HPA was about even sequentially, as was power. HVAL was lower due to declines in a number of markets, including consumer, which was seasonally slower, and handsets.","Embedded Processing revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 7% sequentially. From a year ago, automotive grew, while communications infrastructure and catalog products declined. Sequentially, we saw strong growth in automotive, as well as double-digit gains in communications infrastructure revenue. Revenue from catalog products was about even sequentially. As a reminder, communications infrastructure was exceptionally weak for us in the fourth quarter, so it is encouraging to see this revenue begin to recover.","In wireless, revenue declined to $373 million in the first quarter or 12% of TI's total revenue, down from 19% a year ago. As we had expected, baseband revenues declined sharply to $87 million. This revenue was down $247 million from a year ago and down $192 million sequentially. Revenue from OMAP applications processors was up strongly from a year ago but declined from the fourth quarter level, when we benefited from several customer product introductions ahead of the holidays. Connectivity revenues declined in both comparisons.","Strategically, our plan for both applications processors and for connectivity products is to significantly broaden our market reach in areas outside of smartphones and tablets. We have the right products for many of these applications and the customer relationships in place to engage. Although it will take time to significantly diversify this revenue mix, we have begun to shift our investments accordingly and are already well-positioned with some key customer programs.","In our Other segment, revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 5% sequentially. The decline from year ago was driven by lower DLP revenue, as well as the end of our transitional supply agreement, most notably our agreement with Spansion that expired at the end of 2011. Sequentially, weakness in these same areas was more than offset by the insurance proceeds and higher custom ASIC revenue.","In distribution, resales were about even sequentially. Distribution inventory remained at about 6.5 weeks, about the same level as we ended the fourth quarter.","Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin P. March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter. Total acquisition-related charges in the quarter were $174 million. These charges relate to our acquisition of National Semiconductor and include $21 million in cost of revenue, with the remaining $153 million all on the income statement line identified as acquisition charges. The charges included in cost of revenue were associated with the termination of a National Semiconductor distributor contract. After this quarter, the acquisition-related impact to cost of revenue will be minimal and we do not expect to call those expenses out. All remaining charges should be specifically included on the acquisition charges line.","Also in the quarter, we had $10 million of restructuring charges associated with closing 2 factory sites that we announced in January. In total, these charges impacted EPS by $0.10. Gross profit of $1.53 billion was 49% of revenue and declined 1% sequentially. There were a couple of items that impacted gross profit and gross margin in the first quarter. First, the underutilization expense in the quarter was essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. Although we increased our wafer starts in the first quarter, wafer output declined compared with the fourth quarter as the effect of our lower production starts in the fourth quarter worked its way through our manufacturing operations. The net result is that average utilization levels of our manufacturing operations, and therefore, the associated underutilization expense, were essentially unchanged in the quarter.","Of course, the underutilization expense should start to decline in the second quarter, as the effect of our higher production starts in the first quarter works its way to our manufacturing operations. Also, as I discussed earlier, we incurred $21 million of acquisition-related charges in cost of revenue in the first quarter. This negatively impacted gross margin by about 70 basis points.","Finally, gross profit and margin benefited from the insurance proceeds. Because this insurance was largely for business interruption, it moved all the way through the income statement, starting with revenue. So if you're analyzing the effect these proceeds had on gross margin, be sure to adjust both revenue, as well as gross profit. You should calculate about 100 basis points of gross margin benefit from these proceeds.","On a segment basis, while we don't normally discuss gross margin at this level, it is important to recall that our transition services agreement with Spansion, which was previously reported in our Other segment, ended in the fourth quarter. As a result, the portion of the Aizu factory that was used to support Spansion is now available for analog products and this underutilized cost is now recorded in the analog segment. Operating expenses of $971 million were above, as we had expected, and the increase in the last quarter is mostly the result of seasonal increases associated with the timing of the holidays and employee vacation time in the fourth quarter, as well as annual pay and benefit increases that occurred in February.","Other income and expense was lower in the quarter, as we took charges associated with the discontinued business. Net income in the first quarter was $265 million or $0.22 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to letting unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the first quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $4 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we've reported.","I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $449 million, down $67 million from a year ago and down $521 million from the prior quarter. As a reminder, cash consumption is typically higher in the first quarter as we pay accrued annual profit-sharing and performance bonuses. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter, down $91 million from a year ago and down $49 million from the prior quarter. In fact, this is our lowest quarterly level of capital spending in almost 3 years, as we benefit from having pulled ahead fab spending through opportunistic purchases over the past few years.","We repaid $300 million of our outstanding commercial paper in the quarter, bringing the remaining balance of this obligation down to $700 million. We also used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 9.1 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $195 million. We increased our inventory by $65 million in the quarter, bringing inventory days to 105 as we prepare for higher shipments in the quarters ahead. Orders of $3.24 billion in the quarter increased $380 million or 13% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in the quarter.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.22 billion to $3.48 billion in the second quarter, for growth about 3% to 12% sequentially. If you eliminate the first quarter's insurance proceeds from the comparison, growth is expected to be 5% to 14% or about 10% at the middle of our range. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.38. We expect the second quarter's results will be negatively affected by about $100 million in acquisition charges and about $10 million in restructuring charges. Combined, these items will impact EPS by about $0.06. For 2012, our estimates for R&D, capital expenditures, depreciation and our annual effective tax rates are unchanged from what was provided to you last quarter.","In summary, our markets have bottomed and are in the early stages of recovery. As we talked about this last quarter, we anticipated this and are well-positioned to service our customers' rising demand as they end their inventory correction and ultimately, begin to replenish their inventory from current low levels. We're looking forward to a year of growth.","With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you help us just walk through the gross margin assumptions here? I think if I back out the insurance proceeds, I'm getting a 48% gross margin for Q1. How do I walk that through to the guidance for Q2? Because I think I'm getting 49% there and I'm not sure if I'm doing that right.","Kevin P. March","Yes, Glen, you're probably doing that right in the direction -- directionally, it's correct that you should be seeing gross margins going up. And by the way, you got your 1Q computation correct when you adjust for the insurance. So about 48% without the insurance. And so generally speaking, we expect that to increase as we move into second quarter. As I talked about, starting up the factories a little bit more, higher utilization, benefits should come early in the second quarter. I'm not sure what share count you're using but I'd say you're directionally moving in the right direction.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And maybe just as a follow-up to that, I think I might have expected to see more. Maybe can you walk through some of the mechanics there? Is there -- shouldn't we be seeing more leverage in the gross margins or is it more -- am I missing something here?","Kevin P. March","Yes, I'd say you're a little bit like. As I said, Glenn, you're directionally moving in the right direction. Again, I don't know how you built up your model but I would see our gross margins being a little bit higher than what you have built in your model so far.","Operator","We'll go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess a couple of things, maybe. If I could start in the other wireless category. Obviously, one of the sort of back-and-forths over the years has been what will happen to connectivity as the baseband business kind of falls off. Obviously, baseband we all knew about, Other was a little weaker this quarter, too. Is there any way to say how much of that was just the market or is the customer exposure being a little bit softer versus any impact from kind of the basebands pulling the connectivity along with it?","Ron Slaymaker","Glen -- or I'm sorry, Jim, I don't know that I would say there's any direct tie to the baseband. I guess I could say there's an indirect tie in that we sell connectivity products to some of the same customers where we sell baseband, to the extent that those customers' business is not particularly strong as you see both on the baseband line, as well as would show up on some of the connectivity demand products -- demand for some of our connectivity products also. But then, we also have, separately, customers that use connectivity products that do not use our baseband products. And in some of those cases, we've also seen declines as well, totally independent in that case of the baseband.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess kind of bigger picture, and this is something that had been asked on the mid-quarter update. But historically, you guys have done very well hitting the numbers. The last few quarters, it's been a lot tougher. Obviously, we were in a downturn and sometimes it's tough to get in front of that. But as you look back on a number of quarterly misses in a row, do you think about approaching guidance any differently going forward or you just -- there, do you just kind of look back on it and say it was a tough downturn but it's over and the way we've kind of rolled up the model historically is how we're going to do it going forward or were there any changes made?","Kevin P. March","Jim, I would say that the short answer is we'll continue to do what we have been doing. It was a tough downturn, that was also complicated by the fact that we were, frankly, executing on the largest acquisition that we've tried to take over in the past. And so that's behind us now, we're moving forward. We use the same model and approach that we have to forecast our outlook.","Operator","We'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit again about the Core Wireless business. So with the baseband now finally rolling off, we're back to negative operating margins in wireless. Can you give us some feeling what level of revenues in Core Wireless you actually think you need for at least to break even and where those margins can maybe go over time? I'm also wondering, from that margin standpoint, does it actually make sense to be in this business at all? Are you going to drive enough upside as you move it into more of the Embedded business to make up for any of the wireless shortfalls or is that not just some sort of a capitulation as you're moving out of smartphones and tablets?","Kevin P. March","Stacy, I'll take part of that and let Ron help out on some of it, too. If you look back as recently as the last quarter and do your math, you'd see that in fact, the Core Wireless actually did make a profit. So its ability to generate a profit is certainly already proven by the historical results as evidenced by the fourth quarter.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But that was baseband, wasn't it, that was driving most of that?","Kevin P. March","I think even if you extract that, you'd come to the same conclusion that Core Wireless made a profit fourth quarter. As far as the margins are concerned, we've talked about in the past that the margins in that non-baseband portion, certainly not as rich as what you would see over in analog or even in better processing space, but still quite attractive. The real focus in that area at this point is that clearly, we're spending enough to be able to develop the products that we need. What that team is heavily focused on now is driving the revenue growth and taking it beyond just as single source, Ron, mentioned in his opening remarks, where the diversity of our customers is such that we would expect less impact to the company on single markets or single large customers, and wireless following through on a similar strategy, where they are trying to deliver the technology from their non-baseband products into adjacent markets that can give us more diversity, both of markets and customers. And those will include spaces such as automotive and certain other applications that they've gained some interest and traction on here recently. So the focus there is really now on driving the top line. There's certainly enough spending already in place to be able to meet the R&D requirements.","Ron Slaymaker","So Stacy, just to add, so fourth quarter was about $150 million higher revenue in those core areas. So you asked what level of revenue does it take. That's the recent data point as Kevin said, those core products were profitable at the operating margin level last quarter. So we're nipping on profitability, we just need revenue that will be sustained. And certainly, what we're doing in these embedded areas, by no means do we consider that capitulation, but actually a means by which we can further enhance revenue on what should be a -- basically leverage the investment we've already made for smartphones and tablets and be able to go reach into some of these other market segments as well.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I did actually have a follow-up on that point. So how does long does it take to actually ramp meaningful revenues in those other kind of markets? What's the sort of, I guess, design in lifetime? How long does it take to win that design and how long does it take before we can expect to see meaningful revenues coming out of those? And is there any sort of incremental investment that needs to happen if you think your OpEx in these markets is at comfortable levels to drive that?","Ron Slaymaker","Boy, there were a bunch of questions there, Stacy. I think the core question was how long does it take to drive meaningful revenue in these other areas. And I guess what I would say is, it will take a while. This is not something that, in some of these other areas, where the product lives can be very long. The design in aspect of them tends to be a little longer than some of the high-volume verticals is as well. So we don't expect -- this is not a strategy to go address things over the next 1 to 2 quarters. This is something that we build on what we have today. And over time, we will increase the diversity, and therefore, the stability of that revenue mix. I don't think -- Kevin, you can comment, but I think we believe the investment level that we have today will take us into these new spaces. This is not a big incremental investment to be able to go drive these products into new areas. I mean, think about the biggest infrastructure investment is the sales force, which is already in place today. And by the way, that's the biggest competitive advantage we likely have as well. I mean, clearly, we have to have the right products. Once you have the right products, you have to be able to have the right reach into the customer base and that's the sales force that's in place today. But it's not a big incremental R&D spend to go somehow develop new products or different products for these other adjacent markets.","Kevin P. March","I would just add to Ron's comments there, that this isn't something that the wireless team had just started that is going to be adjacent markets. Greg has already talked about, he talked about it recently in Barcelona that his team has been looking at these adjacent markets for some time now and have over 100 customer engagements already. So that's already began to gain traction, but as Ron says, we expect that each of those markets is such, it will take a while to see the revenue build. But from a cost standpoint, I think that Greg will tell you he's investing adequately now to meet that growth.","Operator","We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Kevin, I just want to make sure that I understand. On the embedded -- I'm sorry, on analog side of the business, revenue was essentially flat. Sequential operating profit was down about $80 million. Was that all due to the Spansion? And help me understand, is that now a continuous headwind around utilization or, help me understand that.","Kevin P. March","John, that's -- the Spansion capacity, the capacity that was being used for Spansion, currently is underutilized, now that we've wound that up. And so that is clearly -- that's allocated into the analog segment and clearly is a drag. But in addition, flat revenues in analog, like some of the other businesses also had seasonally higher paying benefit increases that began in February. So you had the GPM drag that I just mentioned as a result of the utilization, but you also have higher OpEx. So as that revenue builds there, I think it will be able to absorb that just fine over the next couple of quarters, John.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then Ron, as a follow-on, now that you have National as part of the fold, I wonder if you could just re-center me as far as the percent of your business being done through distribution. What's sell-in versus sell-through? And then on the sell-in front, relative to your helping strategy, what percent of the sell-in kind of acts like sell-through? And do you think what we're seeing here is inventory restocking or real demand?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, so in the current quarter, a little over 45% of our business went through distribution. And as you noted, John, bringing on board National, where 70%, I believe, of their revenue moved to distribution. Very similar to our catalog analog areas, such as HPA and to a large part, the Power, and a lot of the catalog Embedded Processing businesses. So much of that goes through distribution -- I'm sorry, over 45%. Of that 45%, about 1\/3 of that revenue is supported by consignment programs. So I mean 1\/3 of the distribution revenue is supported by consignment. I should note, at this point, none of the SVA business through distribution is on confinement because we needed to get IP systems in place to be able to support that. However, that is in fact something that we will do and that we're working toward to put in place. And again, for the broader audience, when you have a distribution program on consignment, our revenue recognition approach sell-in tends to look more like sell-out because it moves the revenue recognition closer to where the distributors pull the product from the hub and actually ship it to their customers. And then if you look more broadly, about 40% of TI's total revenue, and this includes distribution as well as our direct OEM customers, are on consignment. So I hope I got all the pieces you'd asked there, John.","Operator","We'll go to Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just noticed that your inventory days had crossed over 100 in the first quarter and I was wondering if -- just if you could comment on that level, if it was influencing how you're managing this, the factory loadings here in Q2.","Kevin P. March","Romit, I think that that's more -- remember, inventory days are a backward-looking metric and so coming off of a sharp quarter revenue decline and then following that with a pretty sharp expected quarter revenue increase, you've got to state your inventory before you get to that quarter and not after. And so you wind up with, frankly, an anomaly like you're describing, where the days of inventory compute higher than what you'd normally expect to see. But when we look at the mix of inventory, we are extremely comfortable with it and it's lined up quite well with generally the demand that we see. I recall that we talked about our book to bill went positive in the fourth quarter, our orders increased by 13%. That gave us better visibility into actual end demand than we've had in several quarters now, and that gave us the ability to build and stage inventory in anticipation of when that demand needs to be delivered. So I would say that the inventory is positioned quite nicely for what we're trying to do for the second quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","And, Romit, I would also say that loadings in the second quarter, yes, inventory is one variable that plays into that but probably more importantly will be our outlook for third quarter at that point. And the other thing I would say is just even over the weekend, reviewing some other transcripts of conference calls that have taken place, I mean you're already hearing at this very early stage in the upturn, where certain players are finding their own inventory too short or out of mix and having difficulty meeting up with or fully meeting customer demand. We are delighted with our inventory position at this stage in the upturn. So we think it's going to be great. Of course, it will play out as the market grows here over the next few quarters.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I appreciate the color. So loadings are increasing in the second quarter. If I do the math on your gross margin guidance for Q2, I'm coming up with, on a pro-forma basis, around 49.5%, which would be up about 150 basis points sequentially, excluding the insurance payment. and I guess my question is on an incremental basis, that would suggest around 60% incremental gross margin, which is lower than I would have expected. If loadings are up, are you guys seeing a negative impact from mix or some other items?","Kevin P. March","Romit, we'll give you guidance on the top line and the bottom line and in between, we'll leave it to you to develop your models. I would say, again, you're directionally correct, we do expect it to be moving up over the first quarter. And certainly in the direction and the magnitude of not more than what you've been describing so far.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You can also count me on someone who's hoping we're going to have a growth here on semis heat. So we've got a number of companies last week talk about issues with wafer availability from foundry and there's some talk that lead times might stretch out over the summer. Can you comment on how your availability is for foundry wafers? And then also, your own lead times, are they stretching out? Do you anticipate that, that could happen over the summer?","Kevin P. March","Chris, I'll start with the lead time question. Right now, again, one of the things that we have as a takeaway on the last inventory correction cycle was the fact that we probably entered that growth period with less inventory than what was necessary to meet, that would turn out to be quite as strong pullback or snapback in customer demand. So we're coming into this quarter certainly with more inventory availability than we had a couple of years ago, when the last upturn occurred. So with that in mind, we have most of our lead times are quite normal at 8 weeks or less and we have higher levels of inventory than we did during the last industry cycle upturn. Plus, we have considerably more capacity than we had last time. Those combined, lead us to feel that we are going to be well-positioned to be able to meet customer demand even on pretty strong growth basis. As far as wafer foundry availability is concerned, again, a declining portion of our revenue is actually sourced from foundries, especially as you consider the baseband is winding down quite a bit, because that was largely sourced from foundries. But non-baseband portion of wireless also sources lots of foundries. But clearly, with the volumes that they're at right now, we are not experiencing any availability issues.","Ron Slaymaker","And Chris, the other thing I would just say is and I think we've had discussions with -- about this in the past. I mean, even if you look at recent [indiscernible] boards, et cetera, total industry utilization is actually at a pretty high level. And you've seen a lot of semiconductor companies over the past few years not need to, and therefore, they did not invest in new capacity. So whether it's the foundries or whether it's the IDM's own capacity, our suspicion is that if we get into much of an uplift at all in terms of demand, we very likely, as an industry, will see shortages and lead times accordingly stretch out. So, at the same time, like Kevin said and what I said before, having a very good inventory position coming into this upturn, plus having a lot of open capacity, we think, is going to serve us very well.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If you could just maybe run down your take on the end markets, which you think are better, which you think are in the worse shape, and then how you see that playing out for both Q2 and the rest of the year?","Kevin P. March","Okay, I can make some comments. I made probably the most substantial comments already just in terms of our view of what was helping. But clearly, automotive is an area of strength. It's one of the few areas where year-on-year, as I noted, we had growth and that probably partly had to do with some of the automotive industries overall. Globally, we're impacted by supply-chain issues early last year from the Japan quake and tsunami. And so there's a very good recovery. Maybe even some pent-up consumer demand on top of a trend for increasing electronics content and semiconductor growth. Wireless infrastructure, our view is the excess inventory that had tended to build in that channel has essentially been eliminated. We're seeing stronger demand now and we expect that we'll continue to grow from here. Again, we ended up better than fourth quarter but well below both the year ago, as well as even the third quarter revenue levels. In that market, you've heard us talk about before, as consumers with their smartphones and tablets, demand more mobile data. There are just some really positive trends that are taking place there in terms of carriers need to deploy more capacity. And even the type of capacity they're deploying, historically it's been macro cells with -- in both mostly, WCDMA but even to some degree, some LTE. Going forward, you will see more and more of that shift to a small cell type of structure, where our percent of that content, just small cell almost by its very definition, is going to require System-on-a-Chip implementation and we have a great position both in terms of the scalability from what we've done with the same equipment manufacturers from the macro cell and then trying to scale down into the small cell but also just even expanding our position from there. So just a really strong trend, secular trend, overall in wireless infrastructure that we think will play to our advantage, literally, in the years ahead. Handsets, less and less of a direct tie there for TI in terms of the size of that business. But absolutely, we think smartphone market 2012 is healthy. Growth probably in the 25% range for smartphones this year compared with last year. Just some good healthy trends there. Industrial, I think from an end-demand standpoint, probably not a lot of change. But again, I think what we're encouraged about is whereas in that upturn in 2009, we had a lot of the verticals that were lifting in the second quarter, but literally, it wasn't until fourth quarter, if I remember right, before we started seeing industrial really start to recover. We're already seeing industrial markets recover. So again, a lot of it may not be end demand driven, it may just be the fact that they are no longer reducing their semiconductor inventory that's creating the lift on TI. But again, it's healthy for us. Consumer, I think I noted that we had seasonal weakness there and that was in several different consumer areas. I think we had to get out of the first quarter and into what would be a seasonally stronger quarters ahead to really know what's going on in that space. And then probably the last one I would comment on is on computing. We noted earlier that HDD was in recovery mode. We see that continuing into second quarter '12, such that whatever bottleneck HDD has played in terms of the supply side of the PC market, we think, will essentially be lifted. And then, at that point, we'll understand better what PC end demand really looks like.","Operator","We'll go next to see CJ Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, if I look at the midpoint to the south end of your revenue guide relative to end markets and relative to many of your semi peers, you're clearly tracking a little bit better. So curious, your thoughts here, it's more inventory replenishment or Texan-specific in terms of market share gains and\/or your leverage to the right markets? Any color there would be great.","Ron Slaymaker","I think you could see a little bit the all of the above, with the exception of, I don't know that, CJ, I would -- I don't believe we are seeing any real substantial inventory replenishment at all. I think what we may be seeing is lack of inventory reduction. And that, in and of itself, will start to create a lift in demand for us. So again, where ever since, I would say, third quarter of last year through probably first quarter of this year, where we had been undershipping our customers, now that they have their inventory position where they need it, they will start ordering again consistent with their own production rates or their end demand, and that will create a pretty significant lift for us based on our views of how far below that end demand we have been shipping. So, of course, that's going to be broader than just Texas Instruments. But I think we've been busy through the course of the last few quarters, and especially with the National product line, very aggressively working design in position, such that when the market began to lift again, we would disproportionately benefit. And then I think you've also heard us talk about that on the capacity side, we think we will be competitively advantaged, as well as when these markets go back into growth mode.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Real quickly, in terms of some of the discussions around 28-nanometer shortages, I'm just curious if you're hearing anything on the demand side, where on the power management or through all of wireless you're seeing, I guess, some concerns around getting other chipsets and what impacts that might have on the timing of your shipments.","Ron Slaymaker","CJ, just from what I've heard anecdotally through the investor world, it seems like there's some of that starting to rear its head, I have not heard that through our businesses or the customers yet as a specific concern that they have. So it could be there and we just haven't heard it. But we have not had it coming back to us through customers and our business groups yet.","Operator","We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to revisit this issue of gross margins and how we should think about the different moving parts of Q2 implied margins, what are underutilization charges, what is the mix impact? Essentially, what are the -- sort of, the one-off items and what are the more ongoing items. And then how we should think about the walk back towards the mid-50s gross margins model that you had established before?","Kevin P. March","Vivek, I'll mention what I did a few minutes ago to everybody else. But directionally, we would expect our gross margins to be up. I would suggest that maybe when you folks put the models together, maybe they're not quite estimating some lines correctly when they look into the future. One of the things I would point out is that our OpEx will probably be up another 1 or 2 points in the second quarter. And that's just simple math rolling out. In other words, our benefits increase occurred in February of the first quarter. And so the second quarter we'll see a full quarter's effect of that, and that may be where people are having a little trouble on their gross margin analysis. To as far as our overall gross margin model, I would just perhaps remind you that our focus is on revenue growth, and frankly, it's on revenue growth to grow faster than markets and earnings to grow faster than revenues so we can continue to make healthy cash returns to our shareholders as we have been in the form of dividends and buybacks over the last few years. We're not projecting actual margins greater than 55 and 30 and we're also not concluding this from happening as margins are going to be dependent upon product mix and utilization as you pointed out. I think as you heard from Ron, 78% of our revenue now is from our core products and clearly, analog is now more than 1\/2 of our revenue, and that's very encouraging from a product mix standpoint. So I think as we watch that mix continue to shift, we're going to like the results, not just on gross margins and operating margin but importantly, on bottom line cash and what we can do with that for shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On your Core Wireless business outside of baseband, how do we get the confidence that over the long term, this is a real growth driver for the business. Because when we look in the market, and I think all of these questions have been asked before but when we look in the market, we do see, at the high-end, Apple and Samsung really taking a lot of the high-end business and then at the low end, there's just substantially more competition coming online. So how do you get the comfort that this is a business that you should be investing in over the long term? And even if you take it into some of these embedded markets, would these really add value or will they be lower ASP, lower margin-type market?","Ron Slaymaker","Vivek, I guess, this is one where I would just kind of have to -- we will able to give you some progress report as we proceed where we have particular customer successes in moving into some of these adjacent areas that we talked about. One I can just throw out because I'm thinking about it, a release that happened, I want to say, about a month ago, with iRobot, using OMAP for robotic imaging applications. And that's just an example, but in some cases, customers are amenable to having their names discussed. In other cases, they want to -- they'd rather be a little more discreet until they get their products in the market. I think also, we've announced customers in the automotive infotainment space using, again, OMAP. But, Vivek, I would also say this a case where I think our management team has a pretty strong track record of if a business or an operation, the outlook is not what we think it needs to be, you've seen us not be shy about adjusting our strategy accordingly. And so, this is one way, hopefully, we can get some credit just based on a very long solid track record of making those appropriate strategic moves and it will be management driving that change from inside of the company as opposed to, frankly, convincing Wall Street and getting Wall Street to nod or shake its head on where we're headed. So again, give us a little bit of patience here and we'll try to give you some status reports as we're moving along to help you continue to feel good about where we're going with it.","Operator","We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Did you say -- when you talked about small cells, is  that part of the way you have -- would that include that in your guidance or your view for wireless infrastructure both in the quarter that just ended and in the coming quarter? And are you able to -- let me understand how your positioning in that market is relative to other companies such as Casio and Broadcom, and they both free-scale [ph] within that market.  I mean, [indiscernible] has described that market as additive as opposed to cannibalizing macro-based patients. It sounds like you think the opposite. So let me just understand how that plays between your current quarter and your guide and your competitive positioning?","Ron Slaymaker","I think it's -- I don't know additive versus cannibalization. I mean, think what you're going to see is that it's kind of the next wave of technology, I might say, in terms of base stations and we will see a significant part of this spend move to small cell, we believe, as the carriers are doing their best to keep up with just the consumers' data capacity needs. And small cell is one of the most cost-effective means that they can do that because basically, they can deploy these cells with minimal installation costs and even considerations like their electricity usage are much more straightforward than continued deployment of macro level base stations. So I think we're going to see both but we think over time, and this is looking forward, Uche, more so than anything that happened in the first quarter, over time, we're going to see it represent a much more significant piece of the dollar content. In terms of position, a lot of people -- I mean, obviously it's an attractive market, everybody wants to claim success. I guess all I would say is we have a very strong position in macro and we expect that our position in small cell will meet or exceed what we have in terms of macro. So just in terms of where there were known programs that were put out for bid, I shouldn't say that way. Of the total available programs, various carriers, et cetera, not all of which are determined at this point, we've already had design positions in more than, what I would call, half of the small cell opportunity. And those are a number of programs, the market share position actually is higher than that because some of these players are more important than others. So again, we're off to a great start. This is a system-on-a-chip technology, it's going to -- you may see the very first generation be somewhat, what I would call, not integrated. But this is about cost power, a lot of things that because of the form factor, will very, very quickly drive full-up system-on-a-chip implementations. And we're going to be very well-positioned there. So I'll just say we've got great design position, our content, these systems, is going to be very high and we think the market outlook there is really good and it's just going to be one where, again, kind of like what we were saying in previous Q&A, the results will show when the results show. We've got great position but to the extent others claim they have a really great position and create confusion there, we may just have to wait until that translates to revenue and profit growth for TI.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let me ask you, in terms of your view of the restocking rates, and I ask this question because some of the key lead indicators we look at, like the PMI data coming out of China and Europe still are not -- they're improving, but still not at levels that we think is driving significant confidence in your restocking program going on right now. I know you describe the environment as where destocking has stopped but we've seen the orders go up a lot. Do you think the environment, at this point, is enough for us to feel comfortable with basically where these key lead indicators out of Europe and China are still not essentially clear. I mean, the U.S. is strong. That's fantastic, but to what extent do we need all these order markets to show enough for us to feel comfortable that the orders that we're seeing is going to be sustained?","Kevin P. March","Uche, I think you're asking about restocking rate. You were breaking up a bit on your question there, but I'm going to assume that's what it was. So let me take it from there. As Ron mentioned, what we believe we're seeing is not so much the customers are restocking per se, as that they've stopped reducing their inventories. And so even if they just hold their inventories at lower levels, that's going to result in higher orders for us because they've depleted the pipeline in their prior shipments. From an overall standpoint, we do expect to grow in 2012, which means that we're anticipating the economy is going to do okay to support that. And that's a reference to the global economy. There will probably be some stronger pockets than others. One could reasonably expect the Americas were probably stronger than Europe. One could also look at Asia, China in particular, and say that it may -- they may have purportedly slower growth rate than recent, but it's still growing at an extremely fast rate compared to the Western economies. And that rates against a very large economy itself. It's already the second largest economy in the world. So when we put it all together, I'd say right now, we're not seeing or we can't necessarily prove a point to any evidence of customers restocking. What it appears to us is more like at this stage, customers have stopped draining and are now at least holding their inventories and we'll have to make a few weeks or a few months, perhaps, to report to see if we actually see evidence of restocking.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to ask a question on the utilization side and forgive me if it's a little convoluted but the utilization rates you talked about, at 50% to 55% roughly, where did that peak? And really what I'm getting at is you guys added a lot of supply, your own acquisitions of supply, plus adding National. What I'm trying to figure out is how much of that utilization dropped from wherever that peak was due to adding the supply versus the revenues coming down? Or said differently, what revenue do you need to get back to, to have the same amount of utilization-driven goodness with your current manufacturing footprint versus where you were prior?","Kevin P. March","Ross, it may take the 2 of us to try to give an answer for you on that, but the 50% to 55% you're referring to is in fact the utilization rate we discussed last quarter. I don't think we gave -- excuse me, fourth quarter. We haven't discussed what this quarter is just yet other than to say that we have increased our starts in the factories and it takes a while for those starts to become outs. And so our average utilization is about even. But the starts-based utilization actually increased in the quarter. It is worth noting, as you pointed out, the incremental capacity we put in place. Clearly, over the last couple of years, between the factories we acquired and the acquisition of National Semiconductor, we have added $7 billion worth of incremental revenue generating capacity. And so all things being equal, by definition, we've got a lower utilization than we would be at the same revenue levels in the past. And that alone, of course, will cause a larger utilization charge as I think is what you were alluding to. But we clearly have room to increase our revenues substantially with that capacity we've brought on board. And I think the simplest way to think about it is, all-in, it's about $7 billion of incremental revenue generating capacity. From there, I'll leave it to you to kind of model where you think that takes us but frankly, I'm pretty optimistic that's going to not only be attractive from letting us grow revenue rapidly as the markets come back but also do so at very attractive margins given the cost of that capacity when we acquired it.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hopefully a little clearer one, on the SVA side of things, can you talk a little bit about what was driving the sequential growth there relative to your other analog segments given that there's sell in and so DIST [ph] heavy-- I would have thought that they would have acted a little bit more synchronized with your other businesses?","Ron Slaymaker","Well, Ross, the only other thing I would caution against is that was a relatively easy compare against fourth quarter. Because remember in fourth quarter, we had some distribution channel changes where we discontinued one of their major distributors. We added TI distributors. So I would say first quarter, the compare is relatively easy against fourth quarter. So I don't know that I want to draw a lot of real strong conclusions about this market or that market as opposed to just saying at this point, we would say it was an easy compare and put the challenge in front of that team to let's see if they can do it again. And after that, we'll probably challenge them again.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You're forecasting CapEx at $700 million. Still, to get there, you'd have to double the run rate for this quarter. I'm wondering if in the CapEx you reported in Q1, was it what you expected to? And whether or not you got some efficiencies and there's a chance to undershoot that CapEx number?","Kevin P. March","Mark, the CapEx came in not far off from what we're expecting for 1Q. In fact, you'll see us on the spending, actually spend it closer to when we actually bring the equipment in, with the front end of wafer fab capacity required over the last couple of years, a larger portion of our CapEx is aimed at the assembly test sites. And generally speaking, the lead times on that type of equipment is shorter, and so we can order it and install it closer to when we actually have the revenue need for it. So as a result of that, we still are holding to our prior estimate of a $700 million CapEx for the year. I would just remind you, if you take a look at our actual CapEx spend over the last 12 months, it's been a little over 5% of our total revenue and that's translated into a little less than 7% depreciation total revenue over the last 12 months. So clearly, the spend that we did the last few years bringing on the wafer fabs that we did has been at very little cost to us from a fixed standpoint and is allowing us to actually operate at much lower CapEx levels than we had in the past. We've previously indicated that we would be a 5% to 8% of revenue kind of CapEx model given the wafer fabs that we bought over the last couple of years. Over the next foreseeable future, we'd probably run up the lower end of that range, closer to 5% than 8%.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The factory -- could you just spell out, Kevin, one last time, the Spansion impact to the gross margin? Is that something that, just, it hits first right now in the second quarter? And can you quantify the impact at all?","Kevin P. March","Mark, I won't go so far as to quantify but I will remind you, we reported when we came out of fourth quarter, the Spansion revenues ran about $34 million a quarter. And frankly, we weren't -- I would graciously say we weren't making a whole lot of profit on that. So as a result, once that revenue went away, the capacity was left behind and was converted and now available for analog. So that cost is all going into the analog P&L now. That occurred with the first quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","Whereas previously, when it was there supporting Spansion, it was in our Other segment, Mark. Okay, Mark, thanks for your questions and with this, we'll close up. Thank you for joining us. We hope to see many of you next week in New York. A replay of this call is available on our website.

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2015 and 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars.","We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.","Now, I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was in line with our expectations, even though we experienced slowing demand within a sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments.","Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for two items that were not in our outlook. These two items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for restructuring charges, other.","With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market, continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model.","In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago, and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.","We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.","Turning to our segments, Analog revenue decreased 2% from a year-ago quarter. Power management, high performance analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while high volume analog and logic grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from year-ago quarter due to connectivity and microcontrollers. Processors declined. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products.","Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributor inventory decreased about 1 day compared with a year ago to just above 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics.","For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwinds in wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3% and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year, and held our share gains in Embedded Processing.","I'll turn now to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into six categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties.","Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 15%, personal electronics 30%, communications equipment 13%, enterprise systems 6% and other 5%. Of note, Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015.","Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profit set a new record of 58.5%.","Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.","Restructuring charges other was $68 million, which included gains on sales of two properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost-effective 200 millimeter fabs to take about three years and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year.","Operating profit was $1.14 billion, or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities.","Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million, or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, and a net benefit of $0.04 from restructuring other charges.","I'll now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9.","Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million, or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300 millimeter analog capacity, on which we will provide an update in our capital management call in February.","Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement.","In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004, when we initiated our repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that cash onshore, making it available to return to shareholders.","TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within the sector of the personal electronics market. Specifically, we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within the sector of our personal electronics revenue. Except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter.","We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year.","In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages in manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach, and our diverse and long-lived product positions enabled important milestones in the year. These included expansion of 300 millimeter analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points, and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level.","We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey thanks, guys. Can you just divulge to us the market on personal electronics that is causing all the weakness? And if it is handsets, which probably doesn't come as a huge surprise. Maybe also comment on the other end markets, especially PCs where some of the other semiconductor companies have talked about a little bit of weakening in PCs and what you guys are seeing in that end market.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Okay, Chris. The sector where we saw the weaknesses you were guessing is mobile phones and we did see that sector weaken late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year how our end markets did, I'll put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid teens. Most of the sectors inside of that growing, growing double-digits.","Industrial revenue was about even for the year and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing, offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single-digits. I'll note that we had certainly growth in one customer that grew significantly that year, but that was primarily offset by declines in others. So therefore our percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much. It went from 29% last year to 30% this year.","Communications equipment was down 20%. And that was primarily driven by wireless infrastructure and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors. So with that said, Chris, I think as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks, outside of that one area of weakness, everything else came in about as we had expected. So that would be inclusive of PCs and the other areas that you talked about. You have a follow on?","Operator","We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Okay, Chris, if you have \u2013 go ahead, John.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah thanks, guys. Just to follow up, you talked about Apple being an 11% customer for the full year. I'm wondering if you could talk about the linearity of that percentage as the year progressed. Did they exit the year as a larger customer? And as you think about the weakness in Q1 in smartphones, do you feel like you're at a build level that's significantly below sell-through so Q1 will represent a bottom in that weakness? Or how do you handicap that?","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so our revenue profile inside of personal electronics obviously will be more back half-weighted. As that customer did well in the marketplace, obviously our revenues would be reflective of that. I could point out that we sell very diverse set of products to that customer and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around two-thirds of it is in smartphones, and you'd expect, since we've got a pretty diverse position across the customer, our revenues would be very similar.","So, and certainly, I think that whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain, we happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is. That's where we think the demand will come in in first quarter and we'll see. We'll make a prediction on second quarter later.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Yeah, I might just add on that demand profile. We did discuss that we expect about $150 million year-over-year decline attributable to this particular sector in personal electronics. The rest will be about even with last year.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Right, good point. John, do you have a follow-up?","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, Kevin, just to follow-up on that. With the rest of the business even from last year, there's clearly a lot of investor angst about the macro in general. And clearly, if you look at your business profile throughout 2015 and excluded Apple, you saw some weakness in the rest of your business starting in the June quarter. You'd had a couple of quarters of year-over-year declines in total revenue, even as personal electronics has done strongly. And so when you look at the macro concerns that are out there, do you feel like that that's been fully reflected in the June, September, December numbers, and that you're now coming out of this? Or how do you handicap our macro concerns onto your forward-looking guidance?","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","John, I think that at the highest level, we think we're continuing to operate in a relatively weak macro economy as we have been for the last couple of years. So nothing terribly exciting in the economy as a whole. If we kind of look at the comparison we're talking about, recall that a year ago, we were seeing sharp declines occurring in communications infrastructure and we're also seeing some pretty stiff headwinds in the form of foreign exchange where if the rate of exchange moving against us from the US dollar strength standpoint. So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see aside from this one sector of personal electronics, the balance of it's going to be about even on a year-over-year basis.","So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned certainly sounds real, but actually from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it's consistent with what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macro environment, with lots of cross currents going on. Again, last year's weakening in comms infrastructure, very strong auto, foreign exchange issues that we were dealing with. This year, we don't see where those things are coming into play right now.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, and I'll just add that I think that inside of that weak macro economy, just the diversity of our products and the business model, we continue to operate extremely well inside of that environment. Thank you, John, and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Danely.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Hey, Chris.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for letting me ask the follow up. I thought you had something against short people. Just a quick one, so Kevin, as you mentioned, it's kind of a flat environment. You still managed to grow earnings 8% in 2015. So in 2016, if things are flat to down, maybe talk about some of the leverage you guys have or would pull to try and keep earnings flat or could we see earnings be down again? Or excuse me, be down in this year.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Yeah, there's a lot of assumptions inside there, Chris. But let me just remind you as to the moving parts that are going on here. And you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there. I think the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline in depreciation beginning to occur. And clearly, just from an accounting standpoint, that increases our gross profit margin and falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue its glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that a lot of those purchases that we made five years ago are now reaching the end of their depreciable life.","In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in our 300 millimeter capacity and as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip, or about 20% less per device to manufacture on 300 millimeter versus 200 millimeter. So as that mix improves, that will also fall through to the bottom line.","And then the third element that I'd just point out is that we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier revenue margin profiles over time. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months.","In addition to that, from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for eleven years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year. And certainly at current prices, it says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we certainly would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding a significant change in our revenue profile to continue to help us with earnings per share.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Right, okay. Thanks so much, Chris. I'm sorry about the difficulty there. And operator, we can go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kevin, why don't we just continue with the topic you talked about as far as earnings drivers. The OpEx continues to impress. I think for the second year in a row OpEx dropped by 5%. And I know you had some specific closures in Japan, et cetera. If we were to look forward on OpEx, are there any unique drivers, such as closing businesses that are really going to impact that? Or how should we think about OpEx relative to sales?","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Yeah, Ross, I guess the way I'd answer that is that there are no nobs on the horizon right now of any measure that were similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years. As you pointed out, we had some restructuring actions that we took in Japan, and also in certain parts of Embedded Processing over the last two years, and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost. And those are about done now. They pretty much finished up in the middle of last year.","As we look forward, what we would expect to see is what we've talked about in the past, that our OpEx should operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue. In a weak market, it might be pushing 30%. In a reasonably strong markets, it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% for 2015. So again as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile.","I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonal pattern in our OpEx, just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays, and also the annual pay and benefits increases that we instituted across the company in the first quarter. And just to kind of give you some parameters on that, it's probably in the 4% to 5% range increase, 4Q to 1Q on OpEx.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Any comment on that?","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I do. On the communications equipment side of things, you mentioned it was down about 20%. That's not a huge surprise. You mentioned the wireless cause of that. Can you talk a little bit about what that segment did sequentially in the December quarter and what sort of outlook do you have for it heading into 2016?","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, I think, if you look at that sequentially, it was down around mid teens, but from a year ago, it was down mid teens, but actually did see some growth. That was the second quarter in a row that we had growth inside of there. So I think that business continues to be one that over the last couple of decades has been very, very choppy. That characteristic probable won't change. But we're on a position where we've got a couple of quarters of growth. I think that when we look at it longer term, we do believe that carrier CapEx won't grow. It certainly won't drop to zero either. But we do think that it will get smaller slightly in time. Okay thanks, Ross. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. So last year you expanded gross margins by about 120 basis points, which is very impressive given the flat, the macro environment. But if I had asked you a year ago where would gross margins go given all the levers, right, because it moved from 200 to 300 millimeter, the lower depreciation, the mix shift towards industrial and automotive, do you think you would have thought gross margins would be even stronger than right, what you might have than what you actually achieved? So my question really is that as we look forward, what is a bigger driver of gross margins? Is it top line growth and wafer starts or do you still think that 200 to 300 millimeter, that move is being underappreciated in terms of a gross margin driver?","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Okay. First off, let me just make sure we've got the scorekeeping going on correctly here. I think we're talking about 130 basis points of improvement this past year.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, yes, 130.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Don't want to miss out on that extra 10 there. As I look into 2015, clearly any meaningful revenue growth will incrementally have a much stronger impact than any other piece of the P&L on improving overall gross margins. But independent of margin growth, I'd go back to what I talked about a few minutes ago on Ross's question, and that would be really the increasing mix improvement on 300 millimeter, the mix to industrial and auto and then just the decline in depreciation as we continue to march through 2016. It's pretty tough to handicap which one would be the biggest contributor, or how to sequence those. But I think that they will all collectively be quite meaningful as we move into 2016 and I think we'll probably pleasantly please ourselves again for another year.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, and I'll just add to that, Vivek, that on essentially flat revenues, all of that came down to free cash flow growing by 6%, right. So there's some things going on with accounting rules of on the gross margin line, but really we're focused on growing that gross margin, or on the free cash flow growth specifically and it clocked in pretty nicely as well. So you have a follow on?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thanks Dave. The question is on your Other segment where you have the DLP and calculators and ASICs. So that was down about 14% if I ignore the legacy wireless piece. Why was it down so much and how should we think about that segment in 2016? Thank you.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Sure. And if you look for the year, it was down, I'm not sure if your question was for the year or for the quarter. It's actually the same reason. It's down primarily due to custom ASIC products. If you remember, those products have a very high exposure to wireless infrastructure and that's where we saw the headwind. It was also down because DLP, and DLP had a very good year in 2014, so very, very difficult compare on that front.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Good year because there was a strong World Cup demand pulling through DLP.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And how to think about it for 2016?","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so I think that if you look, last year was in the mid teens. If you go back several years, it's actually been in that same range. Previous years were primarily driven from the exit of the wireless business. But as we go into next year and as we look, essentially that we've got some long-term growth potentials inside of DLP. I think calculators have been flat to slightly down and we would continue to expect to see that. Growth in royalties, royalties have been about 1% of our revenue and we'd expect them to continue to run in that area. And then we've got ASIC that will shift over time into our Embedded Processing as we pick up that functionality. So we'd expect that mid teens to slow somewhere in the mid to low single digit declines going forward. Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go ahead and move on to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the strength in your Embedded segment in December, you also had a good growth in the September quarter as well. I'm focused on the MCU products here. Can you just help us understand what are the end markets and trends that have been driving the strength here in the MCU biz? I'm assuming most of it was auto and industrial, but love to get your insights.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so I think when you look at the Embedded sector, if I look for the year, the increase was due to connectivity and microcontrollers. And both of those product lines I would say have a very diverse customer footprint, and so there's really not one sector or market that's driving it. Collectively, you're right. It's in industrial as well as automotive, but probably has a bias to industrial, just because of the diversity of those customers and where they're winning designs. So very, very broad based, and that's part of the reason why we're encouraged with that business and the growth. And I think that also you see how that contributes to the bottom line and the profitability of that sector, or that business for the year.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for that color.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Have a follow-on, Harlan?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. On your broad catalog analog business, it's a high gross margin business. I think the team has done a good job of continuing to improve the breadth and the access to the portfolio. So I guess the question is did the catalog business outgrow the overall Analog business in 2015 and do you expect it to outperform overall Analog this year as well?","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, so we don't really have our business so much lined up by catalog or not. I'd say that the majority of the products by number certainly are more catalog-based as we've got tens of thousands of products. But we're not quite organized that way. I mean we've got the four businesses of the high volume analog and logic, which will be more application-specific products. And even there, even though they're application-specific, many of those products are available to multiple customers and even sometimes multiple markets, even though they're application-specific. Something like motor drivers, as an example, sell into multiple markets and multiple sectors. We got power and then high performance analog and SVA. So we just don't have a cut between that. Okay, thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to our next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, thank you very much. Dave and Kevin, I wanted to go back to the overall environment, and in the past you guys have been very good about giving us essentially sign post metrics. Dave, I think if I remember correctly, rate of cancellations and a few others. Could you please remind us what those metrics are telling you about the overall health of TI's business? And then I had a quick follow up.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Sure. I think, Ambrish, as we just look at our business and as Kevin mentioned before, we believe that we've been operating in a weaker environment and that that will continue from some time. We've had some people ask us if we think a semiconductor cycle is underlying what we're seeing and we just haven't seen those signs of a traditional cycle. So there are things like our lead times continue to remain short. Our cancellations remain very low. Our distribution inventory continues to hold around 4 weeks. And we continue to deliver our products on time to our customers when they're asking at very, very high service levels. So those are some of the bigger ones that come to mind, that you would see some movement if you were moving through a bottom or a top of the cycle, and we just haven't seen that in quite some time.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Makes sense, Dave. And then my follow up was on the industrial segment. And obviously I don't pay attention to the quarter-quarter, but on a full-year basis, if I recall what the number you gave us, it's flat for the year. And the year before that, it was up 10%. So given it's such a cornerstone of your business, also your gross margin expansion, how do you explain the flat year-over-year last year and then what do you think industrial should do in 2016? Thank you, Dave.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Sure, yeah. And before I talk about industrial, I just want to remind those that may not be as familiar with us, when we talk about our industrial market, it's something that's very broad and different than what a typical investor would look from an industrial screen. So we've got 14 sectors that makes up industrial and they'll include things like factory automation, medical and healthcare, building automation, grid infrastructure, test measurement, motor drives, electronic point of sale, space and avionics, display power delivery, appliances, lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else that goes into it. So slightly or very different than what most people would think of in industrials.","And you're right, it had a strong year the year before. I think when we started the year, we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out. And typically a lot of people ask us, hey, we hear the rumors in China. We see the stocks that they follow maybe in the industrial segment are seeing very, very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally what we think's going on inside of that is that there's more semiconductor content going into the industrial market and we think we're in the very early stages of that.","And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars ship per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAAR unit growth and what the semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly impossible to be able to see inside of the industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more of runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the insight I think I can share on that. Okay thank you, Ambrish, and we'll go on to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Rolland with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey guys, thanks for the question and excuse me if this has already been asked. If you could give us a little bit more detail on the Scottish fab and what was being made there and how large was that footprint, and then also, what kind of OpEx opportunities you might have there.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Chris, the fab in Greenock, Scotland, is one that came to us with the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011. Most of the parts that are manufactured in there are part of our Silicon Valley Analog business. We announced today that we are going to, I think we're putting together plans to wind down operations there and move the production to other 200 millimeter fabs that we have in Germany, Japan and Maine in the US. These are larger, more cost effective, more technologically advanced factories that can just give us a lot better economics with those chips that are produced there. It will take us about three years to wind down those operations by our estimate right now, as it takes just that much time to requalify those parts into other factories. And at the end of that period, we will no longer have an operation in Greenock. We took a $17 million charge in the quarter as we began planning for that activity and we expect that we'll probably continue to incur roughly $2 million of charges per quarter each quarter through the end of 2018 as we wind it down, for total charges of about $40 million over a three year period.","Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great, one more follow-up there. Why not any opportunities to move to 300 millimeter? And then also as we look at Embedded, I think we concentrated a little bit on MCUs, but maybe we can talk about connectivity and why that was up year-over-year. And does the growth in MCU year-on-year at all change your penchant in M&A towards Embedded versus your favorite Analog?","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Dave and I are going to have to tag team that one. I'll finish off the Scottish fab one, the why not 300 millimeter. Short answer is most of those processes are dual qualed already in other 200 millimeter factories and it's just a whole lot easier to transfer into a qualified process already existing in other factories. Not all, but enough of them. And so consequently, we'll just go ahead and put those into open capacity in 200 millimeter factories versus bringing them into 300. And Dave, you want to take the?","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, Chris, your question on connectivity, what's driving the growth there. There we've got a very broad portfolio of products we support, about a dozen different standards from a connectivity standpoint, so low power Bluetooth to Wi-Fi to other sub-gigahertz standards. And so if somebody wants to connect something, we have a solution that we can offer them. And so we're just seeing really good uptake of the products that we've got there.","I think you rolled in a question about does it change our penchant for acquisition. Again our belief is that when you acquire a company in the Embedded space, you're picking up additional architectures and additional architectures doesn't make you stronger, it just makes you bigger. And so we'll continue to look for companies that have characteristics much like a National does. If we, when we are interested and that's the profile of the type of company.","Let me just add, too, on the Greenock facility that we do expect to save about $35 million once we've completed all the transition. That's on an annualized basis, and once we do complete the transition of the products to the more cost-effective fabs. Okay. Thanks, Chris, and we'll move on to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, and I wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the 300 millimeter points that were made. Kevin, can you help me understand where in the portfolio on a segment and sub-segment basis the company is having the most success with the 300 millimeter transition and therefore, what's left to go? And as you look at the opportunity, is it a fairly steady opportunity or are there some discontinuities hemming in your ability to move product over to 300?","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Well, Craig, I'd say the benefit is really happening right now in the Analog portfolio, and it's happened across all four of the business units inside Analog. Because of it, 300 millimeter factor we have in our fab being highly automated, somewhat counterintuitively you don't have to have really high-volume parts running through there, because the automation we can actually run relatively low-volume parts through there and still gain significant cost benefit. So what, the way we've been employing the 300 millimeter strategy is not so much to re-qual existing 200 into that factory, but instead to release new products into that factory on already qualified processes. And that's really the focus that we've had and it will continue going forward. And we'll give a further update as to our progress to date on both the runner (42:57) fab as well as the DMOS6 fab that we're converting that we announced last year, coming on February 9 on our capital management call. So stay tuned for that. We'll give a new update on that as well.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and then switching gears just on the competitive front. A couple of competitors in the MCU business have recently announced that they'll be getting together. Thoughts on the implications for your ability to continue to grow and take operating margins in Embedded from the mid 20s higher if there's a more consolidated landscape out there. Thank you.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah.","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Yeah, go ahead, Dave.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","I was just going to say that we've obviously competed with both of those companies for a couple of decades and them combining together really doesn't change much from a competitive landscape. And we believe that our four competitive attributes that make us unique, they're hard to replicate. We'll stay focused on those and those are our approach to manufacturing, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of the market channels that we've got and our diverse and long-lived positions. And that's what we'll stay focused on those, and we think those have helped us gain share and they'll help us continue to gain share. Okay. We've got time for one more caller, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee.","Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT","Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I could focus in on the fact that you did report Apple as a 11% customer. Can you maybe talk about your expectations for the full year in terms of content? You did mention you're in many different devices, but on a like for like device there, do you believe that you're holding content, increasing content? Any guidance you can give us and maybe how we should think about that being seasonally, the impacts on that seasonality.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Yeah, Doug, we just won't provide color at that level on a specific customer. I just, overall, I think if you look at how Apple has impacted our business with their success in the marketplace, personal electronics was about 30% of revenue in 2015. If you look at the market overall, I think if you take memory out, personal electronics is probably around 60% of the market. And so we have about half of the exposure there. So we try to find places where we've got some differentiation where we believe that those products will last more than one cycle. Perhaps they're products that we developed that we can use in other customers or even in other markets in some cases. So that's really what we'll stay focused on overall. So do you have a follow-on question?","Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT","I do. It's actually probably for Kevin. Looking at, you mentioned depreciation ramping down. Can you give us a sense of how quickly? I've got you running at about a $688 million rate for the year, but your CapEx I believe around $500 million. How quickly should we see those numbers merge together?","Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations","Yeah, I don't think you're going to see CapEx and depreciation cross over before the end of 2016. Depreciation will continue to run down during 2016. And really the kind of gentle rollover you saw begin to occur in 2015 is your best proxy for how to model 2016.","David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Doug, and thank you all for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 9 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","The first quarter was a good start to the year for TI. Our positions in analog and embedded processing contributed strongly, with combined revenue for these products up 13% from a year ago. As important markets such as industrial and automotive continued to embrace electronics technology, analog and embedded processing products are critical and TI should benefit accordingly. ","Revenue of $2.98 billion was in the upper half of our expected range that we communicated in January. Earnings per share of $0.44 was at the top of our expected range. EPS included $0.02 that was not in our prior guidance from sales of a site and other assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions.","Free cash flow was $3.1 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12 months period, right in line with the 20% to 30% range where we expect to operate over time. For those of you who missed our capital management call in March, we raised our expected range for free cash flow margins from 20% to 25% to 20% to 30% in that call. Also over the past 12 months, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In the March call, Kevin explained that our updated model for cash returns to shareholders was to return all of our free cash flow less the net debt amount that is retired plus proceeds that we received from exercises of equity compensation. Inclusion of the exercise proceeds was a new addition to the model from what we had previously communicated. Against this targeted return level, we returned 99% over the past 12 months.","In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 3% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 11% with double digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago with all four major product lines up. Power management and high performance analog led this growth, and were each up about the same amount.","Embedded processing revenue grew 17% from a year ago with micro-controllers leading the way. Our increased investments in this growth area over the past few years are yielding favorable results. ","In our other segment, revenue declined $186 million or 28% from a year ago due to legacy wireless which has now declined to the single digit millions of dollars. ","Turning to distribution, Resales increased 10% from a year ago, while distributors\u2019 inventory remained about the same and it\u2019s just under five and a half weeks. From an end market perspective, the most growth from a year ago came from communications equipment, followed by industrial and automotive. ","Enterprise Systems was about even, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that previously used legacy wireless products from TI. ","Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. ","Kevin March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.61 billion or 53.9% of revenue. Gross profit increased 17% from the year ago quarter. This was a solid increase in profitability, considering the 3% growth in total revenue. The 630 basis point expansion in gross margin as a percentage of revenue reflects an improved product portfolio, higher utilization of our manufacturing assets and the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. ","Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $845 million was down $33 million from a year ago. The decline reflects restructuring associated with the wind down of our legacy wireless products. As a reminder, we will begin to see the benefit of the previously announced restructuring in a better processing and Japan in the second half of this year. While we are discontinuing R&D spending in the areas that are no longer able to provide differentiated growth, we continue to invest aggressively in those areas that are providing growth such as analogue where we\u2019ve increased our R&D investments by 77% since 2006, resulting in steady increases in market share. Or as Ron mentioned, more recently with our stepped up investments in embedded processing, which is now resulting in multiple quarters of year over year revenue growth. ","Moving on, acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which is the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges included a charge of $32 million for the previously announced restructuring about as we expected. There was also a gain $37 million for sales of the site and other assets associated with earlier restructuring actions. As Ron mentioned, this gain contributed $0.2 to EPS in the quarter and was not included in our prior guidance.","Operating profit was $690 million or 23.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 75% from the year ago. Again, this was a solid increase considering total revenue was up 3% over this period. Net income in the first quarter was $487 million or 0.44 per share. ","Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $462 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 112, consistent with our model of 105 days to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $77 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.49 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $405 million or 3% of revenue. Capital spending for the year ago trailing 12 month period was $476 million or 4% of revenue. Consequently, free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.08 billion or 25% of revenue in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. This is 8% higher than the free cash flow was a year ago when it was 23% of revenue. ","Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $864 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $459 million or 3.7% of revenue. Our strategy to opportunistically time our purchases of manufacturing equipment has provided us a manufacturing capability today that has sufficient headroom to support growth for years ahead. Our current level of capital expenditures, provide us with important new manufacturing technologies while also continuing to expand our capacity. Over the next few years, as a result of this strategy, we expect to continue to hold capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. Therefore depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margin will directly benefit. ","As we have said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the first quarter, TI paid $325 million in dividends and repurchased $720 million of our stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Historically we have described our capital management strategy was to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what we need to repay debt. In March we updated this model to also include the return of proceeds that we received from the exercise of equity compensation. In the past 12 months, free cash flow was $3.08 billion. ","Our debt level was essentially unchanged and we received $1.14 billion of proceeds from exercises. So our target of return model would be about $4.22 billion. We actually returned $4.18 billion to shareholders on a 99% of the model. So our recent practice has been well [aligned] with the updated model. This percentage will likely move up in the second quarter as we retire debt that is due in May. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was 38% higher than a year ago. ","Dividends were up 48% and stock repurchases were up 34%. Fundamental for our cash strategy and our cash management, are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $4.03 billion of cash and short term investments, with 84% of that amount owned by TI\u2019s U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely on-shore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. As a reminder, we issued $500 million of debt in the first quarter at an average coupon rate of 1.8% for three and seven year terms. And we plan to retire $1 billion when it comes due in May. ","TI\u2019s orders in the quarter were $3.07 billion up 4% from a year ago and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03. ","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.14 billion to $3.40 billion in the second quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. If you exclude the $148 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year ago quarter, revenue would increase 13%. We expect second-quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.63. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil and acquisition charges will remain about even which is a non-cash amortization charge that will be at this level for the next five years. We have revised our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 to 28%, up a point from our prior estimate, reflecting our high expectation for profitability in the year. This is the tax rate that you should use for the second quarter.","In summary, I think the first quarter provided a glimpse into the potential financial performance that TI should be capable of going forward. Our Analog and Embedded Processing product lines will benefit as the industrial and automotive markets continue to increasingly embrace technology. These are markets where we\u2019re investing that offer the promise of sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The low capital requirements for Analog and Embedded Processing, combined with our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets, also means that we can deliver strong free cash flows, which would allow us to continue to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ","With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) and we go first to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me open the questioning. Congratulations on the strong results. Kevin, helpful on giving us topline and bottom line guiding for the June quarter. I\u2019m just kind of curious, as we think about gross margin and OpEx, how does the OpEx saving kind of [linearly] fold into the model between now and December? And on the gross margin lines, should we just think about sort of that 75% historical incremental gross margin against revenue growth?","Kevin March","So John, let me start with the OpEx. As you look into the next quarter in particular, recall that in the ... just to step back for a moment. On an annual basis, we typically have our pay and benefit increases occurring in the first quarter. And typically, two of the three months of the first quarter will incur that increase. So clearly as we go into second quarter, we\u2019ll have a full three months of that increase. But to the point that you were bringing up on some of the savings that we\u2019ll see from the restructuring in Embedded Processing actions, we\u2019ll see a little bit of that savings begin to materialize in the second quarter. So OpEx will probably be fairly flat. The majority of that savings will occur in the second half of the year. And just to remind everyone else, we\u2019re expecting about $130 million in annualized savings as a result of that announced restructuring. On the gross profit, it\u2019s exactly as you said John. You should be thinking that over the course of the cycle, our fall through average is about on the way up and on the way down. So that\u2019s a good long term model to be using as you build your model. ","Ron Slaymaker","Follow on, John?","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Yeah. Ron, maybe you can help me out a bit. Given the reclassification of revenue you guys did, I\u2019m just kind of curios, how does a mix influence gross margin? And if you think about the new buckets of revenue, where do you expect to see faster, longer term growth versus slower, longer term growth, either by design or just by market forces? ","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. And when you talk about our reclassification of revenue, are you talking about by end market or are you talking by -_","John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","By end markets specifically, Ron. Thank you. ","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Even though was end market, let me first of all address that more by product line. So the biggest mix change has been as we\u2019ve gotten out of legacy wireless. And even though that\u2019s essentially zero as of first quarter, you\u2019ll still see the impact on the year-on-year comparison through the course of 2014. And in general the legacy wireless gross margins were lower than corporate average. So getting out of that, those product areas was beneficial to gross margin. From and end marker stand point probably the way to think about it is that gross margins tend to be highest and this is not unique to TI; you can just look across a broader range of companies, but gross margins tend to be highest where volumes tend to be lowest. ","Meaning where -- maybe the better way to say it is where the revenue is most diversified across customers and application areas so for example, industrial. You can see other companies that are highly focused on industrial and we see it in our own results where you\u2019re selling catalogue products into lots and lots of different customers and different applications within the industrial space and that tends to be at pretty nice gross margins. Other areas like automotive where there are a lot of special requirements from the standpoint of quality, the design end cycles tend to be long. The product life cycle both in automotive and in industrial tend to be long and that tends to be beneficial for gross margins also. ","They probably tend to be lowest in the short cycle, high volume end market areas and that\u2019s partly the nature of the competitiveness of those opportunities, combined with you don\u2019t really have time in terms of the life cycle of the product to engineer in cost reductions, to get gross margins where you would really like to see them over time. And so there\u2019s lots of examples of that and again you see it in our own results and you would see it probably more broadly with other companies. So if you say where you would expect to see highest growth over time, I would say just make a couple of observations. ","I think both industrial and automotive from an application area, from their embracement of electronics technology, they\u2019re at a tipping point where those very likely will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets going forward just by nature of the provision of semiconductor technology inside those applications. Now I would also say that we have a good position in those markets and we believe analogue and embedded are important. And we also believe frankly our sales force and the breadth sales force is an important competitive advantage for TI in reaching especially in the industrial markets, a broad base of customers there. ","So probably not surprisingly and you\u2019ve heard us say for some time now, they are priority areas for TI in terms of investment and in terms of our expected penetration into those markets and applications. And that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that their revenue will grow faster as a percentage of TI\u2019s total because you never know what will happen in a particular high volume market. But over time I think you would expect that our position in those markets get stronger and over time the percent of our revenue that is coming from industrial and automotive will continue to grow as well. ","Okay. John, thanks for the questions and let\u2019s move to the next caller. ","Operator","And we move next to Mark Lipacis with Jeffrey\u2019s.","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I apologize if I\u2019m asking you to repeat what you\u2019ve read in your script, but could you just walk through the mechanics of the capital return for this quarter? You have the debt that you\u2019re going to pay down, but you issued some. So I understand that the free cash flow plus the proceeds from the options minus the debt services is what you expect to return. So if you have $1 billion, do we just subtract that $1 billion or do we also factor in the $500 million in debt that you issued this quarter as part of that pay down?","Kevin March","Mark, let me try to get to the way you\u2019re trying to ask that question. Again at the high level, I\u2019ll repeat what you said there. Our cash return strategy is to return 100% of the free cash flow, less any amount used for net debt retirement plus proceeds that we get from stock option exercises. During this past quarter or during this past 12 months, there was virtually no net debt retirement. So it was really the proceeds from free cash flow plus the stock option exercises was virtually all -- we returned all of that to the shareholders in the last 12 months, 99% of that to the shareholders. ","As you move into second quarter, we do have $1 billion of debt that\u2019s coming due on May that we\u2019ll go ahead and pay off. And so when you re-run that math, you\u2019ll see some usage over that trailing 12 months of cash for debt retirement. And just mathematically that says the percentage we return by the time we get to the end of second quarter will probably be in excess of 100%, probably in excess of 110%. But that\u2019s just timing and as you go through the course of the year that will net itself as we move on through the year.","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Let me just ask a clarification, Kevin. So in a quarter where you pay down debt, does that immediately come right out of repurchases or is it a more smoothing type of application in terms of the way you look at the return formula?","Kevin March","It\u2019s a more smoothing type of application. It will not affect the timing of our repurchases. We will continue to do repurchases, as you\u2019ve seen us in the past, which is a very steady hand, constant hand as we go through time. And we don\u2019t try to time our repurchases. We just try to be very steady and methodical about it. ","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow up, Mark?","Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Yeah, I did and thanks for asking that clarification, Ron. I appreciate that. In trying to model the cash flows through the year, normally you have Q1. You have accounts payable and accounts receivable are a big use of cash, which they were this quarter and then in Q4 accounts receivable becomes a nice source of cash. Is it fair to assume that that typical pattern is what we would expect to see? And is there any other working capital shifts that might happen this year that\u2019s different than what you\u2019ve historically had? Thank you.","Kevin March","Mark, I think you\u2019ve identified that quite well. Typically our first and second quarters are our lowest for cash flow and operating cash flow and free flow cash generation. First quarter we had pay and benefit increases as I mentioned earlier. We also pay out our profit share and our performance bonuses during the first quarter. Then the second quarter, we of course have estimated tax payments that we have to make for the year that uses some cash, but as we travel through the year, our operating cash and our free cash flow have a tendency to increase, first to second to third to fourth and then decline again. And I don\u2019t see anything in 2014 that would suggest that would be any different than what we\u2019ve seen for a number of years now.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay Mark. Thank you for your question. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. ","Operator","We move to Doug Freedman with RBC","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi guys. Congrats on the strong results and thanks for letting me ask a question. If I could, could you dig into a little bit what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the mix of product, whether it be ASPs units, and then a little bit of insight into maybe your back log , what you\u2019re seeing in lead times book-to-bill and maybe the projected turns that you need to meet the mid-point?","Kevin March","I can maybe give you a little bit on that. In terms of ASPs Mark, Doug, excuses me, I\u2019m really not aware that there\u2019s been any significant shift one way or the other. And again that just tends to shift that take place on ASPs when you have differentiated products such as we do, tend to be more driven by mix than they would general pricing environment you might say or a competitive pricing environment. Again no substantial shift there other than when you look over time on, the longer term impact of moving out of legacy wireless. Lead times are generally stable. At any point in time you always have some mixed differences that might cause lead times to move in or out for one product area versus another. But generally lead times are stable and for TI what that means is the majority of our products are shipping with lead times of less than six weeks.","Ron Slaymaker ","I\u2019ll comment on backlog. Doug, you asked about that. We came into last quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.94 and we\u2019ve come into this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.03. So clearly we\u2019ve got a little bit more visibility than we had last quarter or even the quarter before that. Just to put that in perspective, orders in the quarter -- I think we mentioned earlier we are up about 4% year over year. That works out to being up about 7% quarter over quarter. So with those combined elements from a backlog standpoint, that leads to expect that we will have pretty reasonable growth in total revenues as we go in second quarter as indicated by the guidance that we\u2019ve included with this release. ","Kevin March ","And I know I\u2019ve said this before, but let me just remind you that with the 1.03 book-to-bill, today about 45% of our revenue is supported by consignment and JIT programs. And so for that revenue, book-to-bill is always 1.0. So the 1.03 is a blend of really only the revenue that\u2019s non-JIT or non-consignment which is 55% of our revenue. So if I just round and call that half of our revenue, the book-to-bill on those products that would be shipping on traditional backlog and order entry type process would be more like a 1.06, the total being a 1.03 because that 1.06 then gets blended with the JIT consignment products at a 1.0 book-to-bill. ","Ron Slaymaker ","Okay. Hopefully that helped and didn\u2019t further confuse. Did you have a follow on, Doug?","Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks Ron. No. That was excellent color, I really do appreciate it. My follow on is really about sort of the cost of running the business. I know that you guys have executed your restructuring plan to lower some of the cost, but how should I think about the cost in OpEx going forward in relation to say revenue growth? If revenue growth continues at say double digit pace, does the core OpEx grow with that same double digit pace or is there some leverage there?","Kevin March ","Yeah. Doug, I think that we do have some leverage certainly in 2014 and that is the restructuring that we announced in [beta] processing and Japan. That mostly will kick in during the second half. So again just to remind you, that\u2019s $130 million of annualized savings that we expect to capture by the end of the year. So as we roll into next year we\u2019ll see it on an annual basis. That $130 million will spread roughly 65% in R&D, 20% in SG&A and the balance of 15% in cost of revenue and cost of goods sold. So we\u2019re kind of spread that way. Beyond 2014, again I think we\u2019ve commented a couple of times on prior calls our basic model for OpEx is to operate between 20% and 30% of revenue. So it will not go up or down necessarily at the same pace that revenue goes up or down. It will be more of a steady change over time, but some of these one off anomalies like I just described with the restructuring going on in a [beta] processing and Japan. ","Ron Slaymaker ","Okay. Doug, thank you. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. ","Operator","We move to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities ","Can you give us your thoughts on the relative growth rates of your analogue versus embedded versus your -- I guess your other category this year? And then maybe talk about just the various puts and takes of why embedded was up so much, analogue was up a little bit less and the other was down so much this quarter? ","Ron Slaymaker ","Chris, are you asking for comments on forward looking or kind of why the historical results were what they were?","Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Both will be great. If I had to choose one I\u2019d say forward, but both would be great. ","Ron Slaymaker ","Okay. Forward will be short discussion because we have -- really I can say legacy wireless will continue down through the rest of this year when compared against the year ago period. But it\u2019s zero already. So I think the reality is it\u2019ll be what it\u2019ll be. You\u2019ll see certain times when Analog grows faster than Embedded. You\u2019ll see periods where Embedded grows faster than Analog. I think Kevin even in his opening remarks mentioned that. I think it was back in 2010 where we stepped up investments in Embedded because we believed there was a great growth opportunity for TI and microcontrollers. We have answered questions from you guys for a long time about where\u2019s the growth that goes along with that stepped up investment. And frankly I think we\u2019re starting to see it now. ","It make sense because it takes time first of all for that R&D to translate to products and then for products to get designed into customers and them to get their products to the market. I think what we\u2019re seeing now in Embedded, very specifically in the micro controller area has to do with the stepped up investments that we made a few years ago in microcontrollers. Certainly also what\u2019s helping Embedded is I think we mentioned that from an end market standpoint, we\u2019re seeing strength in communications equipment as well. And clearly the DSP position, our processor position we have in Embedded across pretty much all of the various OEM\u2019S that ship into that wireless base station market are benefiting now in terms of that market starting to lift for us. ","In terms of Analog, the same thing. You\u2019ll see over time periods where power grows faster. In fact probably that would be a trend that you\u2019d say if you look over an extended period of time, meaning five years or so power has pretty consistently led growth in Analog. And we think that\u2019s an opportunity that will just continue in the years ahead. That has to do with the world wanting to get greener in terms of power efficiency and it has to do with a lot more products in the end market becoming battery power and that\u2019s a great power management opportunity for TI. Our leadership in that market means that as that market lifts, we probably tend to lift more than most other players.","Outside of that, what we\u2019re doing in Silicon Valley Analog, what we\u2019re doing in high performance Analog, both those areas in the industrial market are very clear beneficiaries of the industrial market continuing to lift. So I\u2019ll stop there. Those are some general comments. But again we don\u2019t really try to mention it, Chris. We have certain areas like industrial and automotive that are important to us, but frankly pretty much every product area, whether it\u2019s application specific products or processors or catalogue analog devices can reach into industrial and can reach into automotive and be beneficiaries of that strategy going forward. ","Do you have a follow on, Chris?","Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Yeah and I hopped on a little late. So I\u2019m sorry if you already talked about it. But can you just go over what utilization rates were during the quarter, what you\u2019re expecting them to be this quarter? And then given all the restructuring and fads et cetera, maybe just refresh us on what your sort of peak revenue level is and where you would need to start adding equipment in terms of a utilization level?","Kevin March ","Chris, on utilization again we haven\u2019t disclosed the actual percentage utilization in quite some time. We tend to do that when it\u2019s really a dramatic change, it\u2019s informative. I will just say that our factory utilization from a stats basis was higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter, but the average wafers that moved through the factories was about the same in both quarters. So, consequently the underutilization charge was the same in both quarters, both fourth quarter and first quarter at about $105 million. With the outlook that we have for the second quarter with the guidance that we\u2019ve offered, clearly we have been and we\u2019ll continue to increase the loadings in the factories to support the increased expected outlook revenue growth in the second quarter.","And then just to the last part of your question there, the installed capacity that we have today is equipped to the point to support we believe about $18 billion of revenue. As we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to increase capacity at the lowest possible cost as we have done for a number of years now so that we can remain focused on maximizing continuous free cash flow over time as opposed to trying to maximize factory utilization levels over time. ","Ron Slaymaker","Okay Chris, thank you. Let\u2019s move to the next caller.","Operator","We move next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Ron Slaymaker","Are you there Blayne? Operator, why don\u2019t we move on and if Blayne comes back in maybe we can bring him back up.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities","Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks. So I was just jumping on here a little bit late, but I noticed the guidance for EPS growth is significantly higher than revenue growth. is capacity utilization -- Kevin I know you\u2019re not going to give us gross margin guidance, but is utilization the biggest factor driving the fast earnings growth?","Kevin March","I presume that you\u2019re talking in relation to the sequential growth when you\u2019re asking that?","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities","Yeah, in relation to Q1.","Kevin March","Yeah. I think you\u2019re going to see -- certainly you get some EPS growth just off the revenue growth itself. You will see some improvement on utilization. As I mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019re increasing the loadings in the factories. But you\u2019ll also see a similar improvement as you go to the next quarter just on lower manufacturing cost. Recall a couple of years ago that we had announced that we were closing two older six inch factories, one in Houston and one in Hiji, Japan and those basically are behind us now. And so that cost saving is finding its way through. So you\u2019ve got a couple moving parts going on inside there. ","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow on, Romit?","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities","Yeah and can you just talk a little about the impact of OpEx on EPS during the second quarter as well? Thank you. ","Ron Slaymaker","Romit, I believe that Kevin addressed that earlier and he said basically OpEx should be relatively flat. So instead of repeating that, we\u2019ll move on to the next caller please.","Operator","We move to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks for letting me ask a question. Ron, a couple of quarters ago there was a lot of talk about seasonality and what that was going to be going forward and I think you chose a three year average for your sequentials in the fourth quarter. As we look forward is that still as good a boggy as any for the June quarter? And from a sequential perspective by my math, that yields about 8% up. You\u2019re guiding above that. What\u2019s better than seasonal in what you guys are seeing? ","Ron Slaymaker","Ross, I think two months after we gave you that number in fourth quarter, we then started to decline to provide it again. And the reality is seasonality, the number you come up with for call it an average growth for any particularly quarter, will vary so widely based upon the time period that you used to collect that. And so we\u2019ve decided is instead of us giving you our view -- we\u2019ve historically provided \u2013 call it a three year or five average, five year, whatever. The reality is when we threw that number out, it was being perceived as an endorsement of that level of growth for TI and that was never our intentions. ","So I think what we\u2019ve decided to do going forward is just let you guys go through that analysis and provide your own estimates on seasonality. If you need help with the math on whether it\u2019s a three year or a five year average, I probably could help on that, but I\u2019m not going to do it for you. The other thing is and I\u2019ve noted even just looking at reports coming into this current report, I think sell-side analysts I saw had anywhere from call it 4% average for second quarter sequential to up to 9% . And again, that just reinforces that the range is so wide that from our perspective internally, we really just don\u2019t put much emphasis on seasonal average given how wide that range is. If you think it\u2019s important, then we\u2019re going to let you go through that on your own. ","Do you have a follow on, Ross?","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll be a little more successful with this one. Embedded Processing seemed like that was the segment that provided the upside in the quarter that you just reported. As you think about the microcontroller areas starting to deliver growth given the prior investments that you\u2019ve made, can you give us a little bit of color on some of the applications that are driving that growth? And really why did they start taking off finally now? And maybe looking forward what\u2019s the road map from an end market perspective and application? Anything that can give us a little color in helping us to channel check that segment would be helpful. ","Ron Slaymaker ","I\u2019d offer a couple of things. Microcontrollers; the beauty of microcontrollers is they tend not to -- they are so, so diversified across applications. And so good luck on that channel check, but they\u2019re very much so in industrial applications. Certainly automotive is a factor there. The other piece that I would mention for embedded processing that I already mentioned was communications equipment. Base stations clearly was a lift for TI. The only thing I would caution against is the view that that would draw some significant upside, because the reality is I think for most part analogue and embedded processing came in about as expected. And in fact our revenue overall I think we\u2019re 1% or so above the midpoint of our guidance range. So again the quarter generally came in about as we expected. But what drove the strength there would probably be a mix of industrial, automotive microcontroller applications as well as communications equipment. But pretty much everything was broadly up in the quarter. ","I guess that was your follow up, Ross. Thank you and we\u2019ll move to the next caller.","Operator","We move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. ","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Guys, can you hear me now? ","Ron Slaymaker","We can hear you now. ","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey. Perfect, sorry about that. So I apologize also if you mentioned this earlier, but just on the outlook for June, outside of calculators, were there any outliers in terms of products either up or down in your outlook?","Kevin March ","Blayne, we don\u2019t specifically break our forecast out into particular end markets or product areas. But I think what I would be safe in saying is that it\u2019s a pretty broad based traction that is taking place in second quarter and it\u2019s driving that growth. That doesn\u2019t mean everything is up uniformly the same but it is -- we believe the strength will be pretty broad based for us. And as you pointed out, calculators probably is the one outlier where it just tends to have a good back to school strength in the second quarter and we do expect that as well this second quarter. ","Ron Slaymaker ","Do you have a follow on, Blayne? ","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yeah. In terms of your restructuring effort that you\u2019ve talked about come, I was just wondering if you\u2019ve taken any other actions now there are product lines. Particularly microcontrollers seems like an area of investment. Have you kind of reallocated any resources there or any color on if there is any other segments that you\u2019ve paired back on spending? Thanks.","Kevin March","Blayne, last quarter when we discussed the restructuring efforts that we were taking, we included the discussion of embedded processing in Japan. So Japan is clearly one that is underway. It will be complete for the most part by the end of the second quarter or at the end of second quarter. And that was really to resize our presence in Japan principally from a support standpoint to be more commensurate with the size of the market opportunity there. As it relates to embedded processing, we did discuss that we were in some cases reducing investments or discontinuing on some areas that were no longer showing growth opportunities and other cases reallocating. And that affected our processor side as well as our microcontroller side to a lesser degree in Embedded Processing. Beyond those, there\u2019s no other actions that we\u2019ve taken or intend to take that we\u2019d discuss right now. ","Ron Slaymaker ","Okay. Blayne, thanks for your questions. I\u2019m glad you were able to circle back in and let\u2019s move to the next caller.","Operator","We move to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company ","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company","Hi, thanks. Can you just talk about from a big picture perspective, can you -- I don\u2019t know if you tried to segment out how much of your revenue is directly related to internet of things. But can you try to give us some sense of the percentage of the revenue that\u2019s related to IOT what with a in a large semi-conductor company actually creating that as is independent segment? Thanks.","Ron Slaymaker ","Boy Tim, we really don\u2019t and frankly we saw in all the hype that the realm the term internet of things. I think if you look at our capability and market position, it probably is second to none. If you look across processors, microcontrollers that are just inherent in connecting the world. Combine that with our connectivity capability whether Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, those types of capabilities that we have in our embedded business as well. That potential to then go pursue that opportunity of connecting lots of different things, I think is probably second to none. But that being said, as soon as the world goes and puts a big label on it and tries to calculate how much everybody has and this and that, that\u2019s really not what we are interested in. We love the diversity of what you are calling internet of things, meaning if lots of different applications, they have different requirements, they are across different customers, the idea of somehow circling it up into a common end market or whatever we think is probably the wrong approach just because there\u2019s not that much in common there from a technology standpoint or from a customer or an end market standpoint. But again, we\u2019ll just try to stay away from the hype. We\u2019ll keep our heads down and go attack that opportunity. ","Do you have a follow on, Tim?","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company","I did actually, yeah. Sorry, I actually jumped on late, but you might have already talked about this, but can you address the channel inventory, either your inventory, and also inventory in the channel and also maybe remind us of what normal seasonal is for Q3? Thanks. ","Ron Slaymaker","We did hit on some of those things. I\u2019ll say channel inventory for TI we described as less than five and a half weeks, really unchanged from where it\u2019s been for some time now. And I would just say if you look more broadly, we think inventory that we would characterize that as lean. We would characterize customer inventory as lean. Maybe one of the best data points is cancellations from customers are incredibly low right now and we think that reflects a combination of lean inventories as well as the growing demand environment that we are in. But I think both the other pieces there we did address already. ","Okay Tim, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ll move to the next caller please. ","Operator","We move to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. I\u2019m going to just ask one with no follow ups since a lot of good questions have been asked. You guys had broken out as you usually do your segments at the beginning of the year in terms of end market exposure. I think it was 37% was consumer. Kind of a longer term question, is that a number you are comfortable with or is that a number that you\u2019d like to see decline over time through market share growth in segments? Obviously consumer I don\u2019t think is growing as fast on a revenue basis as some of the other markets over time because of pricing pressure and such there. So just a little perspective on where you would like to see that number three years from now? Thanks a lot.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Thanks Jim, and that\u2019s a good question. So let me do a couple of things. I\u2019ll also give a little bit of the color of what happened in quarter by end market because nobody has asked that question. But very clearly we do talk about the one end market being personal electronics and in 2013 that was 37% of our revenue. That is not what you would historically or typically think of as consumer though. It does have products like gaming products in there. It has television in there, set top box, but it also includes mobile phones, notebook computers, printers and also things like tablets. And so it will go down between 2013 and 2014 largely because of our exit from legacy wireless. ","So, most of that revenue would have been shipping into the personal electronics space. But again don\u2019t -- and I\u2019ve had a number of questions from analysts over the last few months that imply that a people think of personal electronics as consumer. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s again mobile phones, notebooks and that space as well. They do tend to be consumer buying decisions as opposed to enterprise, but they are not what you\u2019ve typically thought of in past as consumer electronic. So I think in the prepared remarks we gave a top level overview of what drove revenue from a year ago. Maybe I can give a little more granularity on that. So I think we talked about communications equipment being the highest contributor of growth from a year ago. ","That very clearly tied to wireless infrastructure. Next we said industrial. Interestingly industrial, if you go out to our website, we break that down into multiple sectors, something like 12, 15 different sectors below the industrial level. Pretty much all of them were up in that year-on-year comparison, with most of them up at a double digit growth level, so good strength and broad strength in industrial. Automotive, similarly. If you go look at the sectors on our website, all of them were up. Infotainment products were the strongest, but all of the sectors inside automotive were up. ","Enterprise Systems we said were about even for TI and that really is a combination of growth in projector revenue, which again is primarily DLP for TI, offset by declines in servers and then the last area which we started off with on personal electronics. It was down, but it was down pretty much only due to legacy wireless. If you would have excluded the legacy wireless revenue out of that comparison, then personal electronics would have been about even from a year ago. So again that\u2019s just a little more color of what happened inside there.","Jim, thank you for your questions and let\u2019s move to the next caller.","Operator","We move to Vivek Arya with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. When I look at your first half growth in Analog and Embedded, I think it\u2019s almost 13%, 14% year-on-year. Very strong, well above what we\u2019ve seen from most of the peer group so far. Are you worried at all about double ordering anything that suggests that trends could sail off in the second half? Do you have enough visibility in the second half, whether it will be roughly seasonal? Not anything that suggests that the trends are sustainable versus not. ","Ron Slaymaker","I\u2019ll make up a comment and Kevin if you have anything to add certainly jumps in. Vivek, we\u2019re not seeing at this point signs of that kind of overheated market. Typically that comes along with crazy expedites and things like that that frankly we just didn\u2019t see in the quarter. We saw customers giving us good visibility into their needs. We\u2019ve been shipping at the lead times that we\u2019ve been quoting them and our lead times have been stable. In that environment typically, there\u2019s no need for customers to start that double ordering process that you mentioned. So again we really see no signs of that taking place. In terms of visibility in the second half, again we\u2019ve got customers for the most part trying to give us visibility into their needs. But I would really not say we have -- I would not want to try to provide any specific comments about second half visibility at this point. Kevin, do you have any other comment?","Kevin March","Not much different than what you\u2019re saying. I would looking over the numbers here go back to your point. We did have 13% year over year growth in the first quarter when you combine Analog and Embedded processing. That\u2019s up just a bit from last quarter when it was 12% year-over-year and up a little bit from the prior quarter when it was up to 7% year-over-year. What we\u2019re actually seeing is a slight acceleration in that to it looks like the low teens. And that\u2019s probably consistent with what we talked about at the last earnings release. We said that we felt 2014 was shaping up to be a better year than 2013. And I think this is just reinforcing that. ","And the big difference that we see is that in 2014 it appears in the U.S economy is attempting to grow at a faster pace than it has in the last few years. In 2014 for the first time in a number of years, you\u2019re seeing Europe beginning to grow rather than shrink. You continue to see growth broadly across Asia, albeit at a slightly lower rate, still growing quite strongly. I think what we\u2019re really seeing here is the result of an improving, broader economy and our efforts of trying to gain market share inside those spaces combined our results and the nice growth for TI. And as Ron said for the second half, we\u2019ll give you that forecast, at least the first part of that forecast in about 90 days. ","Ron Slaymaker","Vivek, maybe the other thing that I would just add real quick is, you see our inventory numbers. We have good, healthy inventory. It\u2019s not getting drawn down. And again customers were worried about supply from Texas Instruments, you would see probably some impact on those type metrics and yet we don\u2019t right now. Do you have a follow on to that?","Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thanks for answering that first question. You guys are the largest player in this space. That\u2019s really encouraging to see the kind of trends that you\u2019re reporting. As my follow up question just probably more a math question, but at what revenue level would underutilization charges be behind you? Or asked in a different way, if you\u2019re saying you have installed capacity of $18 billion and your current sales are about, I don\u2019t know say $13 billion, will we continue to see underutilization charges until you use all of your installed capacity? Or how should we think about that underutilization charge number that you report every quarter in relation to the amount of installed capacity that you have and then obviously the implications on how we should model your gross margins going forward? ","Kevin March","Yeah. Vivek, I would suggest you think about it the way we do and the way most of our investors that we speak with seem to think about it, and that is not what is the underutilization capacity of the current period gross profit margin or next period gross profit margin, but what\u2019s the total free cash flow that we can generate with that available capacity and what\u2019s the cheapest way to bring that capacity in house so that we can maximize cash flow going forward? And that\u2019s exactly how we think about it. So frankly we do no focus on trying to figure out how to get the utilization charge down to zero. In fact by definition, with our stated strategy of buying capacity opportunistically when we don\u2019t need it, when prices are relatively low, that by definition means that we will always have open capacity and therefore we\u2019ll always be underutilized in a classic sense. ","But from a cash flow standpoint, when we do the math and the trade off on that and the last few years are certainly proving that out, we generate a heck of a lot more cash flow with that kind of behavior than we would if we focused purely on maximizing utilization which puts us at the risk of buying capacity at two expensive of a price. So that\u2019s the way we look at it. And I\u2019d offer that you maybe think about it on the longer term view like that as opposed to trying to model in near term GPM percent swings and utilization swings. ","Ron Slaymaker ","Okay Vivek, thank you for your questions. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. ","Operator","We move to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein","Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein ","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I apologize if this has been covered. I hopped on a little late, but when I\u2019m looking at your guidance for next quarter and I\u2019m backing into sort of the implications for gross margin, I\u2019m getting something that\u2019s reasonably close to 57%. It\u2019s almost 300 basis points increase. I think you\u2019d mentioned higher revenue. I think you\u2019d also talked about the six inch fab closures. My understanding was the fab closures that were already in the numbers. Is this something that happens like as a lump improvement this quarter or any color you can give us on I guess the relative impact of drivers revenue, cost saving and mix would be very helpful. And I guess just some indication of whether that 57% number is something that you guys are actually are thinking for next quarter? ","Kevin March","Yes. Stacy, on the margins clearly they are going to be up and they are going to be up quite a bit and it\u2019s not dissimilar to what you saw a year ago. If you go to a year ago and take a look you would have seen our gross margins from 1Q to 2Q increased in a similar manner. And in part that\u2019s just a natural effect of stepping up manufacturing production for a typically stronger second quarter versus one quarter. So if you take a look today on a year over year basis, the best way to think about it is that we continue to have improved product mix. A year ago we still had wireless. Now we have virtually none. So it\u2019s mostly analog and embedded processing. ","We have lower manufacturing costs versus a year ago and again this is the Houston and Hiji factories now completely out of the mix. And to a lesser extent we have some lower utilization charges because in fact we are expecting revenue levels this quarter, this 2Q to be higher than they were 2Q a year ago. And so that will take on a little bit more of our capacity. So there\u2019s a combination of things going on there. And the bottom line is that when you do the math, your gross margins are going to be stepping up rather nicely as you just suggested. ","Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein ","Got it. And I guess to follow up on that same trend. Presumably you\u2019ll continue to have higher revenues year over year than you had last year. And you are sitting now, I would think it\u2019s close to 600 basis points higher than you were last year. Does this mean that you could actually maybe even have visibility into the ballpark of 60% exiting the year and going into 2015? Is that something that you guys -- I don\u2019t know if you guys think internally about gross margin targets anymore, but that\u2019s something that \u2013 is this something that could actually be plausible at this point? ","Kevin March","Stacey I would say that a lot of numbers are plausible. We don\u2019t really spend time thinking or looking at it in that context. We spend again more time thinking in context of are we taking steps that are going to maximize our free cash flow on a continuous basis. And in doing that then GPM just tends to fall out. So from that standpoint there\u2019s nothing structural that stops us from getting higher GPMs as we move forward. In fact if we continue to be successful as we have been in increasing our analog and embedded processing mix, at the same time of keeping very low cost manufacturing underneath that mix, then clearly our margins not only are benefiting as you are computing now, but will continue to benefit as we look into the future. ","Ron Slaymaker","Okay Stacy, thanks for your questions and operator I think we have time for one final caller.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.","Eric Rasmus \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ","Hi, it\u2019s Eric [Rasmus] calling in for Tore. I appreciate you just getting me in here. I know a lot has been talked about the restructuring, but maybe just can you talk about the progress on the Embedded Processing business in boosting those operating margins there? I know last quarter looked like just some out performance and the margins were up. But is there a target that you\u2019re shooting for internally? Is there something that you can maybe tell us for your end and maybe help us measure the progress there? ","Kevin March","Eric, I think the way to think about the Embedded Processing is that again we\u2019ve been seeing some nice growth in that business. I think if I recall six quarters of year over year growth going on in that business. So we\u2019re beginning to see the payoff of prior investments resulting in real revenue growth. That growth is in the right areas. It\u2019s where we can -- we\u2019ve got sustainable product revenue streams and very attractive margins. Consequently we\u2019re seeing profit margins beginning to improve rather nicely and that\u2019s even before we see the benefit of the restructuring actions that we talked about for Embedded Processing. ","That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re done. There\u2019s still quite a bit more work to be done, but most importantly with that business is focusing on is growing into its inherent cost base. And so more growth is what\u2019s going to be really important there. And clearly at its current operating profit levels, it\u2019s not anywhere near where we think it can take us to. I won\u2019t go beyond that on forecasting what margins might be, but I think you know from how we operate the business here we\u2019re focused on free cash flow, which means you\u2019ve got to have some right margins in there. And this business still has quite a bit of work to do to get to where we expect entitlement is. ","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow on, Eric?","Eric Erasmus ","Okay, great. Thanks for that. Yeah, CapEx maybe. Where do you see your investments being focused? How do you plan on allocating your CapEx I guess over the next 12 months? Thank you. ","Kevin March","Eric, we did announce that with the 4Q earnings released that we had just acquired an assembly tests site in Chengdu, China. We\u2019ll be spending money on that in 2014 bringing that building up to our standards and bringing the production line up and ready for output in the second half or late this year. So the majority of our CapEx will tend to go toward our assembly and test operations given that we already have significant capacity in our wafer fab operations.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, great. Eric, thanks for your questions and we\u2019re going to wrap it at this point. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.","","",""," ","",""],"19999":["Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Dave Pahl - Head, IR & VP","Rafael Lizardi - SVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan","Chris Danely - Citigroup","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments 4Q '18 and 2018 Year-End Earnings Release Conference. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our Capital Management Strategy on February 5 at 10 AM Central Time. Similar to what we have done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.","For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering three topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter. Second, I'll provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market, and I'll include some additional color in light of the market weakness we are currently experiencing. And finally, since this is the end of a calendar year, I will provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2018. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and the outlook. We'll then open the call for Q&A.","Starting with the high-level summary of our fourth quarter financial results; the weakness in demand for our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. The weakness was across most markets and came in about as we expected. There were a few exceptions that I'll cover in more detail when I discuss our fourth quarter segment and end market performance.","In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 4% and Analog Processing declined 12% compared with the same quarter a year ago; both businesses growth decelerated. Operating margin decreased in both businesses, and similar to the third quarter, Embedded remained weaker than Analog, primarily because Analog benefited from increasing content in 5G, while the weaknesses in other markets became more pronounced in Embedded. It is not unusual for Analog and Embedded to perform differently in the short-term, but they are more consistent in the long term.","Earnings per share were $1.27, including a $0.01 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $6.1 billion, up 30% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 31.2% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300mm Analog output.","We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2018, we returned $7.7 billion in cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.","Moving on, I'll now provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market and offer some additional color on the market. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 4% due to Signal Chain and Power, partially offset by declines in High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue declined 12% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines; Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $31 million from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded grew 9% and 2%, respectively, and combined were 91% of TI's revenue.","Now, given the current market environment I want to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand and our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although personal electronics, and specifically smartphones, was weaker, including Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Automotive and industrial, both declined sequentially but still grew single digits from the year ago quarter. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 20% year-on-year, benefiting from 5G deployments.","On a regional basis, demand in China was weaker than the other regions. End markets within China behaved directionally consistent with the rest of the world. We are seeing signs from our customers and the channel that this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions. We assume that this weakness is a combination of lower local end demand, as well as reduced exports, but we do not have visibility into distinguish between the two. In addition, I would note that distributors, particularly in Asia, did get more conservative on their inventory positions late in the quarter.","Finally, as we do at the close of each calendar year, I'll now describe our revenue by end market for 2018, which is a good indicator of our strategic progress. We break this into six categories: industrial, automotive, personal electronics which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets, and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems, and other, which is primarily calculators. In summary; industrial, automotive and enterprise systems each grew double digits, while communications equipment was about even and personal electronics declined low single digits in 2018. Specifically, as a percentage of revenue, industrial was 36% and automotive was 20%. Personal electronics was 23%, comms equipment and enterprise systems were 11% and 7%, respectively. Other was 3% of revenue, down low-single digits.","One of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity. For 2018, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue. We continue our efforts to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage. We continue to focus our strategy on industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","In 2018, industrial and automotive combined made up 56% of TI's revenue, up from 54% in 2017, and up from 42% just five years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.41 billion, or 64.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $814 million. Operating expenses for the year were up 1% and were 20.5% of revenue, within our range of expectations. For the year, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter, and then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.52 billion, or 40.8% of revenue. Operating profit was down 3% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 29.6%. Our focused investments under best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth overtime.","Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.24 billion, or $1.27 per share, which included a $0.01 cent discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed. As a reminder, the year ago quarter included non-cash charges associated with the tax law changes. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.","Cash flow from operations was $2.15 billion in the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $323 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $736 million in dividends and repurchased $2.01 billion of our own stock for a total return to owners of $2.75 billion in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.23 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.77%.","Inventory days were 152, up 18 days from a year ago, and above our targeted range as mentioned on our last call. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. We have reduced our operating plan starting in the fourth quarter, but we are also working to replenish inventory of low volume devices; these actions have served us well in the past. In addition, we have made progress on our next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. We expect inventory will continue to run above our targeted range for several more quarters.","Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2018, cash flow from operations was $7.19 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.13 billion, or 7.2% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2018 was $6.06 billion, or 38.4% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all our free cash flow to owners.","Total cash returned to owners in 2018 was $7.66 billion. These combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. In 2018, we paid $2.56 billion in dividends, or about 42% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.9% in 2018, and has been reduced by 45% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter; we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.21, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. For 2019 our annual operating tax rate remains unchanged from our prior expectation of 16%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data.","In closing, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. In addition, the macro environment, including uncertainty caused by trade tensions, could impact the depth and duration of this cycle. Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long-term, while remaining diligent in the short-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived positions [ph]. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products; Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets; industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as any of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","I'm curious, how are you managing your utilization in this downturn that you are seeing? I know Rafael, you mentioned that you have long-lived parts but how are you managing utilization? And are you making any distinction by the end-market that the specific part is going into? And as part of that, should we continue to assume the same 75% or so incremental gross margin fall-through?","Rafael Lizardi","So let me answer the last one first, yes. And now let me go back to your question. So as I -- there is a bit of an echo on the call, but as I -- as we talked a lot on the call 90 days ago, we have reduced our wafer starts to align our operating plan better with our revenue expectations; we did that in fourth quarter, and we are doing that again in the first quarter. That does drive lower factory loadings, and that does have a P&L effect but the way we're thinking about it is as an owner, is from a cash standpoint. So inventory is a use of cash, as we drive down inventory that actually helps cash. And more importantly, it sets us up to support our revenue expectations for the coming year. As to revenue expectations, those revenue expectations change overtime, then we'll adjust the factory loadings and utilization in order to manage that appropriately.","Dave Pahl","And I'll just add to the second part of your question; we've got tens of thousands of products across 100,000 customers, so you can imagine the complexity of that planning. The strongest signal that we get is the orders from customers, as well as the demand signals that we get through our consignment programs. So as we go through and planned wafer starts, that is -- that's what we pay close attention to. And obviously in a time like this, we'll be very diligent in watching that, and then proactively moving when we need to. So with that, do you have a follow-up Vivek?","Vivek Arya","So the second part is, I know you mentioned that it's hard to predict when we come out of this downturn. But are there any other signs that you look at, even if there are qualitative, that can give us some indication whether this is a one or two or three quarter issue? I understand it's very trade dependent but have you seen cancellations that are any different or similar to prior downturns? Any other color that you could help -- that you could give us to help us try and at least predict somewhat when we come out of this would be very useful. Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Yes Vivek, so maybe just a couple of things. I think when we look at different things that we can look at like cancellations, they were up in the quarter, but just up a little. Lead times, overall, they continue to be stable. We can always find pockets where we're working aggressively with customers to close but by and far, they tend to be very stable. So we'll look at all of those signals. I think on the broader view, I've been in the industry for over 30 years now, and we looked at data over that period of time, and I've been through 9 up cycles, and obviously, we're entering into the ninth down cycle. And if you stare at the data, and I've seen in your reports, Vivek, that you've done some analysis on that too, there is no typical or average to those numbers but if you had to pick a number it's probably around the 12 months that a cycle could last. And things like that trade tensions could lengthen that, but it doesn't mean it has to be that long; as you know, it could be longer or shorter than that.","So again, the best signal that we get is those orders from customers. Rafael, you want to add to that?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, just to add to that, we are proactively setting the operating plan so that we can manage whatever comes at us. So it's at a level that if we can run sideways for a while, we are prepared to support our potential snapback. Or if it's deeper and longer, then we have to make further adjustments but we are in a good position to make those adjustments and protect the cash flow and have the company in a position going forward.","Operator","We'll move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Just Rafael, going back to kind of utilization and inventory; I know you said in your prepared comments, you'll be above sort of your inventory targets for next several quarters. I'm just kind of curious relative to how you see the world today and what action you've already taken on utilization? Do you think 152 days will represent kind of the peak in inventory days or would you expect it to migrate to higher before migrating lower? And I guess as you answer the question, if you could just remind us with the consignment plan, kind of -- what are the new targets for inventory longer term?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, so that's a good question, let me just give you a few things to think about on that. First, as I said before, at the end of the day our objective here is to maximize long-term growth of free cash flow, so that's how we think about all these norms [ph]. Loadings and inventory is one of them, CapEx is another one, that all we're doing is trying to maximize that long-term growth. With inventory, as we say, we see value in owning that inventory, that's part of the reason why we are building that low volume, those low-volume buffer that we talked about is also the reason why we are increasing the consignment inventory. And that does push -- put upward pressure on inventory. At the same time, we -- overall we have lowered the operating plan, so that is to control the cash that's used for inventory, more or so than any particular inventory days target.","Now to get to the heart of your specific question, it depends, right. So if this thing gets weaker, then inventory days could theoretically go up higher than 152. If it stays above stable, then over one, two or three quarters, we'll get back to the insider range.","John Pitzer","Then Dave, as a follow-up, you talked about sort of -- there has been times where discrepancy in growth between Analog and Embedded; I'm wondering if you could just help us understand kind of from an end market perspective, where the discrepancy is sort of the largest? For example; I know in the comm space, there is a really good content story on the Analog side that might not be there on the Embedded side. So when you look at the difference of growth rates, is there any sort of end market color you can give us?","Dave Pahl","Yes, and certainly, both of those segments do have different end market exposure. We talked about the benefits that Analog is staying in comms equipment. You know, most of our PE revenues in Analog is well, so that's the difference, we do have some inside of Embedded. But -- and John, if you look at year-over-year growth rates for as long as we've had the segments out there, you'll notice in times that they are actually moving in opposite directions but overtime, if you look at those numbers, they really do perform more similar. And then, also if you look at just industry data for the Analog market and compare that to the Embedded market, those behave differently. So I think that that's just kind of the facts of how those two businesses behave. Thank you, we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll move next to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","What was the book-to-bill in the December quarter? And near-term, kind of looking at bookings and the rolling forecast on your direct and consignment base customers, have you guys seen any signs of stabilization or do the near-term trends still suggests kind of continued weakness along the same sort of the slope?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So our book-to-bill, and I always make this comment whenever it's asked, we've got now 65% of our revenues on some type of a consignment program, so you're seeing that number begin to move up as we implement further stages of our consignment programs with distributors; so book-to-bill is somewhat you just have to be cautious with the number. But this past quarter it was 0.98, it was 0.98 a year ago and 0.96 in the last quarter; so that's just what the facts are. I think if you look at things like order linearity, orders decreased each month of the quarter. To some degree, that's not completely unusual that in a fourth quarter that you'd see weakness as you got into the third month. But I'd just say that those orders and the demand feeds that we get from our customers has really driven us to give you the guidance that we have; so that's really where we are Harlan. You have a follow-on?","Harlan Sur","Yes. Given the growth this year, you guys drove another $1 billion of Analog revenues to your 300-millimeter fabs, you've got probably about $3 billion left to go. So, if I assume kind of high-single digits type of normalized revenue growth for Analog, your 300-millimeter fabs are going to be full in about 1.5 years. So it would seem that that the team would be having to make a decision soon about your new fab expansion initiatives. So you guys have any updates there?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, let me give you my view, and then Dave may go ahead and chime in. But capacity planning for new 300-millimeter tranche of capacity, that's something we've got to take very seriously, and something that has a very long-term horizon. So this is something that is not changed by small fluctuations in short-term expectations, so we are continuing the planning process on that and right now we have options to consider and we'll continue thinking of that. As we have said, I think 90 days ago, whenever we do decide to go that route, if we do build our factory, that'd probably be a $600 million to $700 million cost on the shell, the actual building, and that will probably spend over a couple of years. So that's not the only option we have for -- to expand capacity, we can always buy an existing factory and that's another option that we're considering. And also I would say, the -- if we do build a factory, there are multiple locations that we're considering.","Dave Pahl","And I'd just add Harlan; that last year we had about $4.8 billion of our Analog revenue on 300-millimeter footprint, that was up from about $4 billion, that's real close to what the Analog segment actually grew. So again, we plan to talk about as Analog would grow, that it would be 300-millimeter that would support the growth. And roughly, that's what we've seen again this quarter.","Operator","We'll take Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Dave, first of all, congratulations on surviving 8 downturns. Can you guys talk about the ability to manage CapEx and OpEx this year if this sluggish time period continues? Could you work OpEx down on a year-over-year basis? And then, I think you said CapEx was 7.2% of sales or something like that; what should we be thinking about CapEx as a percent of sales this year?","Dave Pahl","Let me give you some background there. First, as I mentioned earlier on the call, all the knobs that we have at the end of the day are to optimize and maximize long-term growth of free cash flow per share; so that's the main objective, as you know very well from knowing us for many years and our capital management strategy. So CapEx is one of those knobs, and for CapEx specifically, what is the objective, it's to invest and support in new technology development, it's revenue growth and to expand our low-cost manufacturing advantage. So in 2018, we spent $1.1 billion for CapEx and as you pointed out, that was 7.2% of revenue. At the same thing, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow, that was 30% growth on free cash flow from the previous years. So despite that CapEx, we increased free cash flow, that 30%. Now that CapEx is positioning us to grow the top line and free cash flow for a long time to come.","Now given, as you pointed out and as our midpoint and our range implies, decelerating market, then we can do things differently on CapEx. Going forward, I expect -- if conditions continue, a slowdown in CapEx, probably not in the first quarter, maybe not even in the second quarter, but over 2019. We'll just keep that in mind -- keep in mind that is all dependent on expectations of growth beyond that for years, not just 2019 or even 2020. So we'll adjust those -- we'll adjust the CapEx plan as those expectations change.","Rafael Lizardi","And I'd just add; I think when you look at 2019, that we'd expect CapEx to run into the future even beyond 2019, closer to 6% of revenue. And that's higher than what it's been in the past just because of the availability of -- use the 300-millimeter equipment on the market, so that's where our expectations there are. You have a follow-on, Chris?","Chris Danely","Yes. Can you guys just talk about how the slowdown is impacting your two biggest end markets, industrial and automotive?","Dave Pahl","Yes, I think that when we look at them, they both slowed in the quarter. We actually saw industrial; it was really broad-based growth on -- from a year-on-year basis, it was double digits but inside of the quarter, it actually grew upper single digits. And then automotive again, it had slowed, but it grew double digits in total for the year but for the quarter, for year-on-year quarter it grew in low-single digits. So again, both of those markets are growing but certainly not at the rates that we have seen over the past few years.","Okay, thank you, Chris. And we'll go to our next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. That will be from Timothy [ph] from UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Dave, can you give us an idea of OpEx for March? I know it's typically up like 5% seasonally, but it's also a little more fixed now than in the past. So is it going to be up a smidge [ph], both year-over-year and on a quarterly basis? Thanks.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, so I'll go ahead and take that. First, step back real quick, OpEx is just another knob that we have to optimize long-term growth of free cash flow per share, right; at the end of the day, that is the long-term objective. And in the case of OpEx, it's an opportunity to invest in R&D, so to put more products for industrial and automotive is an opportunity to invest in demand creation on the SG&A side and other things, other initiatives that's going to strengthen our competitive advantages. If you look at 2018, that OpEx came in at about 1% growth versus the previous year and 20.5% of revenue. On a go-forward basis for 2019, for dollars of OpEx, I would expect somewhere in the neighborhood, maybe up a couple of percentage points for pay and benefit increases, something along those lines. But generally speaking, at about that same level, all OpEx.","Now you asked specifically about the quarter, we give you a range for revenue, a range for EPS; we don't get in the lines between, but I will tell you we're not expecting anything unusual. You can look at the fall-through -- expected fall-through on revenue to GPM [ph] and do your own models, and you should get to a reasonable assumption or conclusion for those lines in between.","Dave Pahl","Do you have a follow-on?","Unidentified Analyst","I do, actually. So Rafael, the Repo [ph] was the biggest in -- as a percent of free cash flow, I'm thinking about 3 years. I know that you don't think of it that way on kind of a quarterly basis but it's historically been a little more mechanical than opportunistic. So should we kind of read into that that you were a little more opportunistic because of the stock pullback? Thanks.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, thanks for the question. So, again, let me step back and remind everybody, what's our intent when it comes to repurchases; and our intent is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company and that objective has not changed. We do that through a combination of dividends and buybacks, and we will be -- we have been and will be opportunistic with repurchases as it makes sense. So for example, in 2018, as I mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was $6.1 billion, that was an increase of 30% from the previous year. And we'd return $7.7 billion throughout the year through a combination of dividends and buybacks. And that year-on-year free cash flow growth was the biggest driver of that increase in returns, as a $6.1 billion increase from $4.7 billion in the previous year.","Dave Pahl","Okay, great. We'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","That will be from Chris [ph] with Raymond James.","Unidentified Analyst","First question, I wondered if you can talk about geographic differences. And you mentioned China in your opening remarks, and I think that's obvious right now. Maybe what did you see there and contrast that with what you saw in the U.S. and Europe; was that weak also, just perhaps not as weak as China business?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, that's exactly right, Chris. So when we looked at China, it was weaker than the other regions. And then when you drop down into the end markets within China, I just described it as really performing very similarly, directionally, meaning that comms equipment was up as it was in other areas, we saw the markets of auto and industrial, as well as enterprise get weaker from that standpoint; so we did see that difference this quarter. You have a follow-on?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. And I guess, you would also mentioned in your remarks the impact of the trade issues and tariffs. And obviously, it's very hard to disassociate that from what's going on in the end markets. But with that, have you also seen -- I guess we've heard this from some others that perhaps there was some activity of either pulling forward orders to get ahead of tariffs, or pushing out things because of the tariffs; and obviously, the deadlines have changed and we've got another deadline coming up. I guess the question is what effect it may have had on order patterns as we went through the quarter?","Dave Pahl","Yes, I think it's hard for us to actually distinguish that specifically. But the one thing that we did see was, distributors did get more cautious on their inventory late in the quarter. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks; I think that kind of coupled with the signs of weakness that we saw in China, that's really led us to the belief that that's part of the caution that they are seeing from a trade tension standpoint. So -- okay, thank you, Chris and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. That will be from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jerry [ph] on behalf of Ross. I just have a quick question on -- you mentioned consignment transition; is there -- could you quantify an impact to the 1Q '19 guide and 2019 as a whole [ph]?","Dave Pahl","Yes, I'd say that we saw probably about $50 million impact in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter -- Rafael, you can remind me, it's about $20 million or $30 million\u2026","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, in the third quarter.","Dave Pahl","In the third quarter of 2018. We'd expect as we go through next year that that impacted to be about in that range. And by the end of the year, we should have that next phase fully deployed. You have a follow-on?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, there has been some questions about end markets; I just want to ask in a different way. Could you just talk about quarter-on-quarter what the end market did, specifically focusing on the fourth quarter?","Dave Pahl","Certainly. So industrial declined upper single digits, I'd just say those declines were broad-based. Automotive declined upper single digits with all sectors decreasing, personal electronics declined low double digits, comms equipment grew single digits, and enterprise systems declined. So with that, I think we have time for one more caller.","Operator","And that will be from Amit [ph] with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess two questions from me as well. I mean, first off, when I look at the March quarter guide and the implication is revenues will decline from 1% in December year-over-year to about 8% in March. What is driving that acceleration in revenue declines? Is there a couple of end markets you would specifically call out that's driving it where perhaps the challenge was adjusting [ph] aggressively or is it more or less broad-based?","Dave Pahl","Amit, when we give our guidance we don't do it by end markets unless there is something specific that is going on that kind of would be discontinuous with how things are operating. So we'll finish up the quarter and let that -- it will provide the details by end markets then. But clearly, the weakness that we saw in the third quarter continued into the fourth. Obviously, that -- we're continuing to expect that to continue into first.","Rafael Lizardi","And just to add to that, as we've said in prepared remarks and during the call; we think this weakness is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We've grown for third quarter in a row [ph], and that's the sort of thing that happens in the semiconductor industry. And in addition to that, the macro environment, including the trade tensions could also be having an impact and could affect that and the duration of [indiscernible].","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-on, Amit?","Unidentified Analyst","I do. In the past, best you have talked about your ability to keep picking up 30, 40, 50 -- 30 to 40 basis points a share across your end markets. As you look at '19 where revenue or broader industry trends are somewhat more challenging, is it easier for larger analog company to pick up more market share or is it more difficult for you guys? How would you kind of stack that up?","Dave Pahl","I think when you look at the quality of the opportunity in the Analog and Embedded space, if market share just doesn't move quickly across any of our peers in these marketplaces; and I think that just really speaks to the quality of that opportunity. So we continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are our manufacturing and technology we talked about earlier, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels which includes our sales force and the size of it but also our presence at TI.com, and then diversity and longevity. So we're not dependent on any particular customer or product or technology to drive that revenue. So we're working and investing to make those stronger, it's just hard to pick up market share; I can tell you that everyone here at TI will be focused on that even as we go through the downturn, and probably have even more diligence and intensity around that overall. But again, if you could make that number higher, we absolutely would, but it is a hard thing to move.","So with that, let me turn it over to Rafael to add some final comments.","Rafael Lizardi","All right. So let me finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. First, during this period of weaker demand, we will stay focused on what will make us stronger long-term and diligent in the short-term. Second, we will remain focused on the Analog and Embedded, the best products, and Industrial and Automotive, the best markets. Third, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company.","Dave Pahl","Okay, thank you for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our Capital Management call on February 5 at 10 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","That does conclude our conference call for today, everyone. Thank you all for your participation.

Welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's Web site. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong as we expected they would be. However revenue was in the bottom half of the range for two reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter and our personal electronics market, particularly PCs and our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure. We believe these markets specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers and capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker than expected refresh cycle for Windows XP. ","The second reason was a steep decline in the currency exchange rate for the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The Euro dropped about 10% during the quarter an even though only about 5% of TI's revenues transacted in Euros it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about 20 million more than we had anticipated. ","Even with these pockets of weaknesses our core business of analog and embedded processing turned in their seventh and tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth respectively. Combine these businesses grew 9% and we're 86% of our total revenue. ","Earnings per share were $0.61 reflecting our continued attention to cost controls although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars ROE negatively impacted revenue by 20 million which translated to only about 5 million of impact to earnings and therefore cash flow."," This is due to a partial natural hedged against negative currency fluctuations due to our non U.S. based operations. It's nice to have position to be in this when we have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S. But that is a backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model. ","In the first quarter our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a two percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.","We also believe this free cash flow will be valued only if it\u2019s returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. For the trailing 12 months period we return 4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago primarily due to power management and high volume analog and logic. Silicon Valley analog and high performance analog also grew. ","As we mentioned earlier this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for analog. Embedded processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to micro controllers and connectivity. Processor revenue declined which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure and again as I mentioned earlier this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for embedded processing. In our other segment, revenues declined 10% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products which also are heavy in wireless infrastructure as well as DLP products.","In distribution, re-sales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks which is a decrease by more than a week from a year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed and the distribution channel with our consignment program.","From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew with most factors inside this market growing at double digit rates. Industrial had broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew although growth in PCs was lower than we expected. Communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure and enterprise systems grew.","Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Kevin March","Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion or 57.7% of revenue. Gross profit increased 13% from a year-ago quarter and gross profit was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory load-ins and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we built more analog chips on 300 millimeter wafers.","Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $777 million were down $68 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.","Acquisition charges were $83 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is non-cash expense. Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 18.3% more than doubling from a year ago as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investments for growth. Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 124 about three days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion, 300 millimeter analog plan discussed in our recent capital management call.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or protectively reinvested in the business. As we've noted our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.","In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in past 12 months was $4.14 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash in short term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets particularly for wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs respectively. We also do not expect a near term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges which are our non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.","In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrated the strength of TI's business model. While we're not immune to demand in currency changes, their affects are soften by the diversity of our portfolio in our markets.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks Kevin. Operator, you can now open the line up for questions. In order to provide as many of as possible and opportunity to ask your question please limit yourself to a single question. After our response we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you (Operator Instructions). And we go first to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Q - Jim Covello","Thanks so much for giving me the chance to ask a question. There is so much controversy in the industry today about whether the industry is as cyclical as it used to be less so, et cetera. I look at your year-over-year growth rates, the June quarter represents the first time you\u2019ve had a year-over-year decline at the midpoint of your guidance in a long time. How do you think about that in the context of an industry where many are arguing that we\u2019re not cyclical anymore?","Kevin March","We\u2019re as you know we\u2019ve been pretty guarded at trying to predict the cycle it\u2019s not something obviously that we can control. We really just go to what we can look and what we can measure. So, as you kind of tick through the things that you typically look at from a cyclical standpoint, we look at channel inventories are down a week from a year ago they\u2019re laying at just under 4.5 weeks. Lead time are remaining consistent our cancellations and rescheduled are very low. In addition we\u2019re continuing to deliver on time and very consistently with that.","So we\u2019ve got a couple of pockets of weaker than expected demands as we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs. At the same time we\u2019re seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be as strong as we expect. So that\u2019s what we know, that\u2019s what we can see, the debates will continue on how cyclical our industry will be and won\u2019t be.","Dave Pahl","I might just add that we do have several significant competitive advantages. The combination of which we believe is pretty difficult for anybody else to replicate and it helps us deal with any notion of cyclicality or non-cyclicality. And those advantages include that we\u2019ve got the broadest portfolio in the industry. This really means the engineers start their design work by looking at us first. We enjoy very low cost of manufacturing for all the reasons that you\u2019ve heard us talk about for last few years including our 300 millimeter wafer fabs. We have the broadest sales channel in fact probably two to four times larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an extremely diverse set of markets with long-lived products that enjoy a significant cash returns to our shareholders for long time. So we think that what\u2019s really important to deal with whatever really happened in market cycles and just really make sure that we\u2019re a lot more competitively advantages than anybody else.","Jim Covello","Obviously you\u2019re talking about some weakness in PCs and coms. In the industrial segment, we\u2019re starting to see some negative news flow from the customers. Do you see pockets of weakness but there is just other pockets of strength that are offsetting those industrial customers that maybe weak because I know it\u2019s a very broad based customer base? Or do you just not see any weakness at all in that segment at this point? Thanks very much.","Kevin March","Jim, I\u2019ll just say that like you are hinting to its very broad based, so we service over 100,000 customers most of those will reside in industrial. And again I think it\u2019s probably helpful for me to just go through and when we say industrial it means something different than I think, the investment definition of industrial. So, it will include things like factory automation and control and medical, healthcare, fitness products building automations, smart grid, energy test equipment, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliances and other segments, so again very-very broad. Of course we\u2019ll always see pockets of strength and weaknesses but overall that industrial is doing well we\u2019ve seen growth in almost all those sectors that I\u2019ve described.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go now to Chris Danely with Citi.","Chris Danely","Dave, you did a good job of outlying I guess the relative areas of weakness in Q1 from currency and com and PC. Can you just give us which you think would be a bigger drag in terms of company sales from PC versus communications? And then do you guys expect a negative impact from currency in Q2 as well and if you could give us the magnitude of that negative impact?","Dave Pahl","So the one that\u2019s pretty straight forward to identify because it\u2019s really just math walking through the numbers is that on year-on-year basis we\u2019ll probably see about a $50 million headwind due to currency exchange rates and obviously we\u2019re not assuming that we see a rebound in those rates. We\u2019ll still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure. And it\u2019s kind of in the -- the balance of the business is as you know there is always puts and takes as an example second quarter a year ago DLP was very strong if you remember, it was benefiting from several world events one of them like the World Cup, that won\u2019t repeat. So, that will be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year.","But inside of that bucket we\u2019ll continue to have puts and takes. The other comment that I\u2019d just make on that that although we see those pockets of weakness if you look at the core businesses and analog and embedded we do believe that those will continue to perform well.","You have a follow up Chris?","Chris Danely","Yes, actually the couple of clarification, do we expect the PC or the wireless infrastructure to have a bigger drag on your revenue in Q2 or then it almost seems like -- do we need the dollar to weaken again for that impact to go way, i.e. if the dollar remains strong is that going to be like a negative for you guys every quarter.","Dave Pahl","Chris, I\u2019d say that we probably don\u2019t have enough detail to tell you whether wireless infrastructure or PC which is going to be of a drag, we just don\u2019t expecting them to be recovering in the second quarter. As it relates to ROE recently with -- if you take a look at the just the euro alone versus a year ago it\u2019s down 23%. The yen is down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that weakness on a year-over-year compare that\u2019s going to continue to be an issue that\u2019s going to just affect that kind of math. It doesn\u2019t affect our ability to sell in those markets. We continue to make very competitive in those spaces and we enjoy on the design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and dollars weaken than certainly with that kind of dramatic decline in those two major currencies that will be at least on the fringes a year-over-year compare headwind for us. ","Kevin March","And I will just add to that like we saw in the first quarter where we had an impact of about $20 million, because of natural hedging we\u2019ve got the impact to operating profit and free cash flow is really only about $5 million. So, fairly small on that front. Okay, thanks Chris and we\u2019ll move on to the next caller please.","Operator","We now go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer ","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for to let me ask the question. I guess I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but just on the outlook, when I look at the Q1 it looks like you guys are only missing the mid points of your guide by about 50 million and you explained 20 million of that on currency. As I go to Q2 if I just kind of anchor against seasonality you\u2019re kind of missing it by 150 million to 200 million and I guess sequentially are you expecting anymore kind of headwinds from currency? I understand the year-over-year compare I\u2019m trying to figure out the sequential compare. And when I look at PCs plus comp infrastructure, help me to understand the percent of the business that represents, I\u2019m thinking around 15; maybe I\u2019m wrong with that. I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense as to why you think that the miss in Q2 is going to be so much larger than those two buckets in the mess in Q1.","Dave Pahl","John let me, I\u2019ll take the first part of the question and Kevin can add in if he like to. The first, if you look at our PC revenues as a percentage of our total is around 4% if you were to include hard drives into that that will add a few points, so you will be just under 10% in upper single digits. If you look at wireless infrastructure last year it was about 10% of our revenue so obviously combined there you\u2019re in the mid-teen. So that will give you an idea of what that impact is. Again as Kevin kind of walked through the math of like the euros an example, last year 18% of our revenue was down in Europe about a third of that so 5% to 6% is transacted in euro and again sequentially, Kevin if you have any additional comments on the impact of the euro.","Kevin March","Yes, I think just 1Q to 2Q, I think is what you\u2019re trying to ask whether John, the average ROE that we experienced on our billions in 1Q was about -- for the euro was about 1.13 and for planning purposes we\u2019re using 1.06 going into 2Q. This it is going to be little bit of a just a quarter-over-quarter ROE impact, just from that standpoint as it relates to the euro. Right now we\u2019re anticipating it again to be pretty flat. ","Dave Pahl","Any follow on John?","John Pitzer ","Yes. I know that was in the comp section specifically you guys were doing a little bit of pruning what\u2019s the product portfolio and I\u2019m wondering if any of the pruning that you\u2019ve done is being reflected in kind of either sequential or year-over-year growth rate. So do you feel like that that\u2019s not a factor as you look at the June guide?","Dave Pahl","Yes, we don\u2019t believe that is a factor John. I think if you look at the impact that wireless infrastructure has, we sell more analog product than we do embedded or the custom ASIC products. So it actually hit both analog, embedded and other. Of course you can see the impact more significantly in embedded and other because it\u2019s a higher percentage of that revenue. But again we\u2019ve got a good position really across to most of the major OEMs there and so what we\u2019re seeing is really a change in chips and demand. Thanks John. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon ","First I was wondering if you can give us a handle on where you see OpEx going next quarter, given the revenue short fall.","Kevin March","Stacy, OpEx was up about as expected both quarter the first quarter and recall that, in the fourth quarter we typically down a bit on OpEx because of seasonality for holidays and so on. In the absence of those seasonality -- those holidays in the first quarter along with our annual pay and benefit increases; traditionally drives are OpEx up quarter over quarter. Those pay and benefit increases kick it in February so it\u2019s really only two months\u2019 worth inside the OpEx in first quarter. So we'll have the full three months, so you see a just very slight increase going to the second quarter.","Stacy Rasgon ","Got it, thank you, that's helpful. For my follow up, again on currency, I know you guys are pointing to sort of direct translation effects. We've had other players who have pointed to demand destruction from currency. I was wondering if you can give us your point of view on what you're seeing more broadly in the market. Not just to your revenues but also for your customers, are you seeing any sort of broad based [can] destruction because of the currency moments that we've got?","Kevin March","Yes Stacy, we've talked about that. But there is no way for us to really point to some and demonstrate evidence that that's actually have occurring. Given the entire industry tends to price in dollars for the [indiscernible] of what\u2019s being shipped, it does not allow us other alternatives it would seem for customers from the demand standpoint. But that's not to say that might not be a second order knock on affect like what you\u2019re alluding to and we just don\u2019t see any way that we can quantify that with any confidence.","Dave Pahl","And there are always pluses and minuses with currency movements, it's really impossible for us to quantify them.","Kevin March","Okay, thank you. We will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We go now to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Given the timing when you start to see the weakness that you talked about in the March quarter and just given the softer than seasonal Q2 outlook, would you have to ratchet down your wafer manufacturing fab manufacturing activity or wafer structuring in Q2?","Dave Pahl","Harlan, yes, we'll be lightening up the wafer starts in 2Q. I would caution you though that pulling back on the wafer starts doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that will have a direct impact on our inventory. As the work in process in 1Q will become finished goods in 2Q, so we would expect our inventory to probably still go up a bit in 2Q, even though we pull back on wafer starts a little bit.","Harlan Sur","Okay, great, thanks for that. And then analog was up nicely 11% year-over-year, despite the headwinds and embedded was up only 2% which is a pretty significant deceleration year-over-year versus the prior quarter, I'm assuming that, the embedded weakness was primarily driven by DSPs, given the muted wireless infrastructure spending environment?","Dave Pahl","It's correct. It was impacted by the wireless infrastructure and in fact if you look at the businesses inside of embedded we had good growth in microcontrollers and connectivity both. But processors were down for the exact reason that you identified now. ","Okay, thank you, we'll go to next caller please.","Operator","We now go to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","One other avenue to get of the broad based demand trends, are you seeing any sort of difference in demand patterns from your distributors, customers relative to the OEM customers, are they getting any more nervous or excited and willing to carry inventory and I realize the weeks of inventory data that you gave before but from a bookings perspective, any color will be helpful.","Dave Pahl","I think, I'll add just offer on that Ross, is that on year-over-year basis bookings were up by 5%. 60% of our revenue does go through [DSP], so clearly we're seeing one of the bookings coming to the [DSP] channel. The inventory levels are carrying over one and half weeks, just down about a week from a year ago, so they continue to carry lean levels of inventory. And I think largely that's because, they know that we carry Inventory and consignment and we also maintain very short lead times since we have for number of years now and so we get inventory quickly is pretty reliable for them when they order with us. So, I don't -- from those kinds of elements inside that space there is no rule again signs that we can looks at that says, there is demand destruction going on because of ROE, they really can\u2019t [indiscernible] there.","Kevin March","And I have to add Ross that, if you look at our resale overall, that was very consistent with our combined analog and embedded sales. So they were in the upper single digits, very close to the same number. So you're following Ross?","Ross Seymore","Yeah a quick one, I just to make sure that I have all the moving parts, it sounds like in an answer to your prior question Kevin, you said OpEx will be upper little, you also said, sound like utilization will be down, it seems like putting that together with your earnings guidance, it implies gross margin is going to be down at bit sequentially, is that -- one, is that may directionally correct? Two, is the cause of the gross margin simply utilization or is there some mix effect that I also need to appreciate? Thanks.","Kevin March","You may be missing the mix effects inside there Ross; I don\u2019t expect much change in the margin.","Dave Pahl","Okay, thank you for that question, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We go now to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","In the markets that you're seeing weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure, do you think -- is that an inventory or demand problem and I guess what is -- we seen other suppliers into the PC sector talk about return just sort of better in seasonal second half as you get past inventory correction, where do you stand on that?","Kevin March","Joe, I just say, first of all that the wireless infrastructure market is has been notoriously been very choppy as you look at demand over the number of years. So, there is usually a significant build is -- OEMs are planning to bid for the operators spend and then it typically surprises us and there is an overbuild that occurs, so one kind of begets the other.","We think that the wireless infrastructure market obviously long term is a good market for us and we've got a good position in and just as the numbers come down, they will come up again one day. On the PC side that's only a couple of percent of our revenue, so I don't think we really have any unique insight on that we believe that that weaknesses is due to the inventory that\u2019s created because there wasn't as much demand in the XP refresh cycle, but really nothing beyond that and we\u2019ll see how the rest of this quarter goes before we start making predictions on the back half, we\u2019ll just take a one quarter at a time. So you have a follow on?","Joe Moore","Yeah and I guess specifically I think John, that you had mentioned the restricting that you did but just specifically you did cut back on R&D and macro based stations and I'm wondering if there is any anything directly that would point to that decision versus revenue seeing ours are completely separate from that.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. Again I think that when we look at those markets they\u2019re very long tailed in product cycles. We continue to make investments, they are just not at the same rates that we were making five and 10 years ago and that's not unlike what we've done in other markets as they\u2019ve began to mature. So there is other areas of wireless infrastructure that looks like it will be very promising growth, like small cells and we continue to invest very -- at a very high levels there while we have very little revenue today so we would just believe that we've got to throttle that investment based on the opportunity overall. So, thanks for that question and will go to the next caller.","Operator","We go now to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri ","I have two questions. I had a question about the channel, did you see any meaningful cancels this quarter and I had a follow up on the inventory?","Kevin March","No. We saw cancellations continue to run very-very low as we\u2019ve seen for a number of quarters now and same is true of reschedules too by the way also very-very low. So no patterns indicating change of demand there.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, great. And then Kevin you said inventory is going to be I think again you said in June despite loadings being down. I guess my question is, what do you think is sort of the -- now that you had a couple of quarters to think about the mix, when do you think is the right normalize level of inventory and do you think that we're going to come back down to that sort of that more normalized level during the back half of the year?","Kevin March","Yeah, Tim. We are going to use 2015 the really kind of monitor the effect of all the changes we've been doing with the portfolio and with our operations to model what we think is a more appropriate overall level of average inventories to carry. What we did conclude was that the prior model which had worked for us quite well of a 105 to 115 days was appropriate giving the mix that we had, but clearly as we moved to more and more consignment, as we move to keeping lead times of very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, I think faced with that we got to carry more inventory than we have in the past.","And so we\u2019ll be using 2015 to run various test on what the appropriate levels of inventories are to meet the service metrics that our customers have come to expect of us and then probably by the time we get to early next year when we do our capital management update we\u2019ll go ahead and appoint a new model at that point in time.","Dave Pahl","Great. Tim, thank you and will go the next caller. Please?","Operator","We now go to Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah","Yes. Thank you. Kevin and Dave. I just I wanted to clarify how these two segments that comprised 15% of revenue are driving what I estimated as a 500 basis point miss relative to seasonality. Are you guys just being conservative in anticipation of may be a fall out in some of your other end markets or and I just not fully incorporating other parts of the equation here?","Kevin March","So I will go ahead and just I think Dave attempted last time, I will give the try. There are several moving parts going on there when we look at 2Q and that compares on a year-over-year basis. So just the ROE alone impacts us about $50 million from a year-over-year compare for growth rate. Then you go beyond that and you've got continuing weakness and wireless infrastructure and PC's and you've also got the absence of the benefit the DLP had a year ago which was meaningful due to the World Cup and other large sporting events.","In fact we saw some of that impact of DLP already begin to occur in the first quarter, as we mentioned DLP was down quite a bit in first quarter. So you got those kinds of headwinds, ROE, wireless infrastructure, PC and DLP and then we've got the rest of the portfolio basically doing fine, because it\u2019s simple with what we\u2019re been seeing in the economies for the last few quarters.","Romit Shah","Thanks for the clarification Kevin I just wanted to ask you about M&A, there has been as you guys have seen a lot of activity over the last year and when I think about TI, M&A has certainly been part of your DNA over the last 10 to 15 years. Can you just talk about how you are thinking about M&A specifically in this environment relative to buying back your own stock?","Kevin March","Yeah our M&A posture haven\u2019t changed at all. That meaning that most important thing is that to the extent that we considered an acquisition is got to be something that fits into our strategy that's consistent with our portfolio interest and something that we can generate long-term returns on therefore access free cash flow for our shareholders. If it kind of passes the strategy test then it's got to pass the numbers test.","And frankly we have a hard time with many of the companies that are out there today making those kind of numbers work. Contrast that to when we bought National back in 2011, at a time when all some [indiscernible] stock prices were considerably lower and you can certainly see in retrospect that was a very good return for our shareholders. So we tend to be very disciplined on that. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined on that. Buying back our own shares right now especially as long as they trade below the intrinsic value of the Company is that also it continues to be a good return for our shareholders especially from a free cash flow perspective.","Operator","We now go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Kevin, you've mentioned if you look at the portfolio, the rest of the business is doing fine outside of the factor that you've highlighted, if you go back to history and look at such a sharp destruction, just used that word, on the exchange rate when do you expect that to manifest itself in other parts of the business. So for instance the distributors in Europe and other pieces get that [indiscernible] go into for instance in industrial and autos, what does past currency issues tell us on that front? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Kevin March","Ambrish, I had some clever insight on that but I am afraid I don't, just from an experience standpoint, I actually do not recall that my experience in this capacity and I've been in this role for a very long time now, seeing currency drop this sharply in this short of period of time. So I have not history from which to trying to get a reference point to answer your question like that. I think we're just all going to have to wait and see where this takes us. I think the encouraging part is especially in industrial and automotive is that the silicon content going in those spaces continues to increase year-over-year and so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that\u2019s going to slowdown the silicon content increases in those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those and equipment\u2019s, the cost of a $0.50 analog chip going into $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer I think. So if you look at the more macro effect and especially where we see growth someone out there in auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind of difference.","Dave Pahl","And I'd just to add as many arguments putting pressure on the demand, there is as many arguments that it could help demand on the other side, so it's really tough to be able to quantify each of those into those impacts. Ambrish, you've got follow-up?","Ambrish Srivastava","And this is a clarification in response to Ross's question, Kevin, did you say gross margin will be flat and if so the way to think about it is that factory loading goes down in the non-300 millimeter and 300 millimeter is continuing to ramp so that offsets that lower factory loading?","Kevin March","That's a safe way to think about it, Ambrish. There is mix going on inside there but clearly we continue to ramp up 300 millimeter which is much more cost effective for us and so in balance we don\u2019t' expect much change in margins.","Operator","We go now to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital.","Doug Freedman","Just to follow on that mixed shift that you're seeing, Kevin, can you possibly give us the utilization on your overall factory base and the utilization that you're seeing in 300 mil? And then I have a follow-up.","Kevin March","Doug, on the utilization, we typically would just talk about that as something drastic has occurred so I won\u2019t go into that right now. I will remind that you on a capital management call, I did discuss for RFAB in particular that we have the majority of the equipment necessary to support the build-out of that factory to a $5 billion revenue level and that into 2014 we had achieved about $2 billion worth of build for revenues in support of that. So call that roughly 40% utilized, but at the same time we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by embedded processing to also be able to be used by analog, metal add another $3 billion of 300 millimeter analog capacity in DMOS6. So you could say in a sense that our utilization of 300 millimeter may actually decline, but that's not because of loading, that's because of increase in our capacity.","Doug Freedman","The question really that I have as my follow-up is when you look at the year-on-year growth, last year clearly you had a nice year but with the guidance you've just offered were actually down year-on-year. If we look at the long-term growth of your business, is there a point in time at which you might adjust what you think your long-term growth rate would be such that you felt factory consolidation would be part of the equation to drive higher efficiency?","Kevin March","No Doug, factory consolidation isn\u2019t on our radar. What we're really interested in is very inexpensive factory acquisition with extremely low carrying cost that allows us to grow into it in a very efficient manner. As we've been talking about analog and a better processing combined for an extended period of time now, have been growing at about 9% compound annual growth rate. In fact even combined for this 1Q that we just closed out they grew another on 9% year-over-year. So they continue to grow quite healthy, I would expect that as we move forward in time we\u2019ll look at those factories that provide us the best cost efficiency and cash flow delivery and keep those operating in load and those that probably going to be biased in our note age towards 300 millimeter.","Dave Pahl","And I just add to that if you look at the growth rates in time just look at what\u2019s happened in second quarter, the overall numbers are very strong, I mean if you look at our gross margins, you look at where our OpEx levels are, our operating margins with that 9% analog and embedded processing growth this quarter we turned in 27% free cash flow. So, our financial performance isn\u2019t predicated on having to hit a certain growth level we can do very well in a low growth environment or if things pick up we can, we are in a good position to build to support that as well. So thank you Doug and we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Maybe just looking back to the weakness in the PC market, you clearly had a fairly seasonal December. And I don\u2019t know if you saw any PC slowdown there, Intel sure didn\u2019t. But then looks like you\u2019ve figured correction in March. So, one, if you could -- I apologize if you already answered this. But within analog which your high performance and Silicon Valley is still up in March and really it was the PC dragging it down, if so would be down probably double-digit. Is that the right way to look at it? And then as you look to June, Intel is up, PC channel starting to turn around. Is it just that you\u2019re working through some inventory or if there is there any way you can quantify that and then kind of just help me with the math as to when do you really start to see that?","Dave Pahl","Well, let me take a shot at it, and then I\u2019ll let you ask a follow up. Some of that I think we\u2019ve touched on. But again the weakness that we saw, Blayne, was really had manifested in March. And that was both in NPCs and in wireless infrastructure. Obviously, I don\u2019t know how that played out at some of our competitors but we do expect to see that weakness in second quarter obviously our guidance is reflective of that. So, I don\u2019t know if that helps or if there is part of that you\u2019d like to ask a clarification or a follow up?","Blayne Curtis","Maybe I would ask -- obviously I can sign up for a full year forecast, so when you look at the businesses of PC in com, clearly they\u2019ve been down for several quarters here or will be with the June guide, to get full year growth would require a substantial pick up in the second half. Do you see these as headwinds this year for you and if so how much?","Kevin March","Blayne, I\u2019ll just take that. We\u2019ll go ahead and forecast the balance of the year in front of each quarter when we get there. So we could just give you a guide, one quarter at a time. Obviously, I think you guys are probably better equipped than we are to come up with analysis to help figure out what the year might be and we\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Dave Pahl","Okay, and that we are now out of time. So I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today. And a replay of this call is available on our Web site. Good evening.","Operator","This concludes our conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.","For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at TI.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for more complete description.","The third quarter was another quarter that marked strong progress. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew again with combined revenue of 10% from a year ago.","Revenue of $3.5 billion came in solidly in the upper half of our expected range we had communicated to you in July. Earnings per share of $0.76 was at the top of our range as profitability was strong in the quarter.","Our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We continue to believe that free cash flow growth is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term, especially on a per share basis.","Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month was almost $3.5 billion, or 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 300 basis point improvement from a year ago period.","We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy which includes our growing 300 millimeter output and purchasing assets ahead of demand at the stressed prices.","We also continue to believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. Over the past 12 months we've returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends paid.","In the third quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago led by power management. High volume analog and logic, high performance analog, and Silicon Valley analog also grew.","Embedded processing grew 6% from a year ago due to microcontrollers, connectivity and processors each of which grew by about the same amount. Embedded processing delivered its eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year growth.","In our other segment, revenue was about even from a year ago as a decline in legacy wireless products was mostly offset by growth in DLP products.","Turning to distribution, resales increased 10% from a year ago consistent with our combined revenue growth in analog and embedded processing. Weeks of inventory were unchanged at a historically low level of just over four and a half weeks. This level was low because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program.","This quarter we continue to convert more of our distribution sales to consignment and now support about 55% of our distribution revenue on consignment up about 10 percentage points from a year ago.","With this program, inventory sits on TI's of balance sheet and revenues recognized from distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that is stored at the distributors' locations. This program minimizes changes in demand due to distribution inventory -- channel inventory and most importantly, allows us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.","From an end market perspective, TI revenue growth from a year ago was due to communications equipment, industrial and automotive, each of which grew by about the same amount. Enterprise systems was also up while revenue and personal electronics declined due to legacy wireless products.","Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin?","Kevin March","Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone.","Gross profit in the quarter was $2.04 billion or 58.4% of revenue. Gross profit increased 15% from the year ago quarter and gross profit margin hit another new record. This gross profit reflects higher revenue and an improved product portfolio focused on analog and embedded processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.","Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $795 million was down $38 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing in Japan that were previously announced as well as continued cost discipline across TI.","Acquisition charges were $83 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were $9 million benefit primarily due to gains from sales of assets.","Operating profit was $1.18 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $826 million or $0.76 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.38 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 108 consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter.","On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.82 billion, up 17% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month the capital expenditures were $367 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue. ","Besides inexpensively adding capacity ahead of demand, we have focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. By combining this capacity with continued improvement and how we manage inventory, we're able to keep our lead-times consistently low while continuing to deliver on time.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.45 billion or 27% of revenue. As we've said, we believe strong cash flow growth particularly free cash flow growth as most important to maximize shareholder value in the long-term that will be valued only if its return to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business.","In the third order, TI paid $319 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $989 million. As we've noted, our intent is to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds that we received from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.","Total cash return in the past 12 months was $4.16 billion which was 9% higher than a year ago. In the quarter, we announced a 13% dividend increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share or $1.36 annualized. This marked our 11th consecutive year of increasing dividends and our 52nd year of continuous dividend payments.","Outstanding share count has reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.19 billion of cash and short-term investments up from $2.80 billion at the beginning of the quarter.","TI's U.S. entities own 81% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.34 billion, up 6% from a year ago and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.95.","This ratio would have been a bit higher except for the effect of the conversion to consignment of some products sold at distribution. While book-to-bill still would have been below one, this is consistent with the pattern that we're seeing for the past four years.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.13 billion to $3.39 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 8% from a year ago.","We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges which are non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $89 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years.","Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter.","In summary the third quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in analog and embedded processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel.","The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, disciplined in allocating our capital, and firm believers that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value.","With that let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks Kevin. Operator you can open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up. Danny?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions)","Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kevin I guess my first question will be on OpEx. Clearly you are well ahead of sort of your expected annualized savings of $130 million with the restructuring actions. How do think OpEx will trend sequentially into the December quarter? And if you look at R&D as a percent of rev now below 10%, is that just a structural change in the model and how worried should I be at what scale level you should be investing on R&D for future growth?","I understand that you are still spending absolutely a lot more money than most of your peers, but tough to see someone with your gross margins and R&D as a percent below 10%.","Kevin March","Okay, John a think there were a couple in there so let me see if I can remember them all. Starting with OpEx and trends, the -- clearly OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter largely as a result of some of the restructuring actions we previously announced as well as just ongoing cost discipline in all the various businesses across TI.","As you look into fourth quarter, if you just go back and take a look at a year ago that's probably your best gauge to take a look at the fourth quarter and even first quarter for that matter.","We typically see that OpEx is lower in the fourth quarter due to holidays and vacations. In addition this fourth quarter, we expect a further benefit of another $15 million of cost to come out as a result of the restructuring that we announced on the embedded processing that's part of that $130 million of annualized savings that you were mentioning John.","In fact we're probably running ahead of that $130 million of annualized savings right now. We're probably come up to beyond that. From the total R&D spend, as a percent of revenue, again, I think what's more important is not how much you spent, but how well you spent it. And I think the best indicator and how well you are spending is what's happening to your market share as a result of the products we're introducing into the market.","In our case, if you take a look at 2006 through 2013, the last full year periods that we reported on, our total R&D spend is up 77% over that period. But most importantly, that R&D is a result in products where we have continually gained share. So, again I think John its less a question of how much you spend and a lot more how well you spend it and spend it on things that customers really carry about.","Dave Pahl","Good. John you have a follow-up?","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Guys quickly just I know you don't give segment guidance or revenue, when I look at the embedded business in the September quarter, it was up only about 1.1% sequentially which is little bit weaker than I had been modeling and I'm kind of curious as to what you think might have driven that?","And given that some of your peers have talked about sort of slowdown in the second half of September from a macro perspective, did any of that play into the embedded business in the September quarter? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Okay. So let me take that, John. I think if you look at the growth rates between analog and embedded processing, you can see a lot of quarters they won't grow the same. And I think if you look at -- both of those businesses they have different end market exposures and really it's those end market exposures that will explain most of the differences in those numbers.","So -- and the second part of our question was, yeah, just -- did -- basically the overall environment impacting the growth that we've seen there and I\u2019d just say, no, that really isn\u2019t in those numbers. Basically that forecast is given off of the orders that we received from our customers. So thank you John. Can we go to the next caller please?","Operator","Yes sir. Our next caller is Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you very much. Just on the overall demand environment. There is a lot of confusion out there, but it seems like things have slowed down, so just wanted your perspective. In the past you guys have given us certain things as you look at such as cancellations and so on and so forth.","And also within that frame of reference, Dave, if you could please just walk us through your disti consignment versus non-consignment? And then how would you compare to somebody who claims that they are sell-through so they see a slowdown before -- a quarter or so before others. And then I had a very quick follow-up.","Dave Pahl","Okay, so a couple of points in there Ambrish. The first is that, I just point out that all of our distributors provide us with a point-of-sale reporting and we get that information on a very regular basis. So regardless of how the revenue is recognized we see what's going on from a distributor resale standpoint.","The second thing, you touched on the current environment, and we really want to be guarded on trying to take a position for the industry on where that\u2019s going. But we can really point to just what we see. ","If I kind of step through those, our inventory on our books is at 108 days is within our target model. If you look at our channel inventories, those were essentially unchanged from last quarter. They are at a very lean level, at just over 4.5 weeks. Our lead-times have been consistent and I would say low. Our cancellations and reschedules remain very low, so nothing changing on that front.","And then probably as we have grown over these last few quarters we've been able to support that growth and keep delivering our products on time at very, very high service levels. So, our operations continue to execute at that high level.","So -- and then I will get to the last part of your question was what percentage of our revenue goes through distribution and what percentage is supported by consignment. So, the first one is, about 55% of our revenues go through the distribution channel and about 55% of that is supported on consignment.","And as we pointed out in our prepared remarks that has increased by about 10% from year ago as we've had a couple of conversions go on this year. And I would say that we are not done with that. We actually expect that additional conversions will happen and -- over the next year or so, so we expect that percentage will actually increase. So Ambrish you have follow-up?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Yeah, a quick follow-up, Dave, on the embedded operating margins you guys have had a steady increase, what's the right way to think about how do you get to North of 20%? Is it just a matter of focusing on the right product mix and getting that ramped up or is it something beyond that. Thank you, Dave. ","Dave Pahl","Sure.","Kevin March","Yeah, Ambrish. I will take that one. On embedded processing there our margins have been continuously improving over these last few quarters and we would expect further improvement. Recall, I just mentioned earlier in the call that we would expect another $15 million or so of cost to come out of fourth quarter and most of that will come out of embedded processing.","I would add that, from this point going forward, and we've talked about this last couple of quarters, the amount of spend inside embedded processing is sufficient. It doesn\u2019t need to increase anymore. What really the focus is revenue growth and that\u2019s what this is really about. And that entire team has been very focused on that.","I believe they just recorded their eight quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue growth, so they clearly are working on the right metrics to really make that business start to deliver profitability at the level we expected to at TI.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. We will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I want to dig into the embedded processor margins again just a little bit. You had about $26 million in OpEx come out from Q2 to Q3. You had revenue in the Group, up a little bit or mostly flat. Margins were only up a little bit.","Given all of that cost in theory I would have expected to come out of embedded processing, why weren\u2019t the embedded processing margins up more. It doesn\u2019t seem like all of those cost savings actually flowed through the margins this quarter.","Kevin March","Actually they all flowed through the margins, Stacy, but not all through embedded processing. Recall, those actions incorporate both embedded processing as well as actions in Japan, which drove margins as well.","Even with that at the EP level you did see about a 72% fall through on that delta revenue. So you're seeing it come through, but do keep in mind that Japan start spreading on some of the other businesses as well.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Got it, got it. That\u2019s helpful. So my follow-up, if I can dig into the gross margins little bit, I think both for this quarter and next quarter. So for this quarter you came in a little bit high, I guess, was that only the revenue upside or was there something else in terms of mix or other cost savings that push it up.","And then for next quarter depending on how far you are guiding OpEx down, it feels to me like you are guiding gross margins implicitly flat to up in Q4 and quarter of revenues are down and typically your gross margins will be down in Q4 as well.","So if you could give us any sort of feeling for what the gross drivers for next quarter ought to be in terms of mix offsetting revenue declines that would be very helpful.","Kevin March","Sure, Stacy. I think that, clearly, the extra revenue came through and it was quite rich. We also had a slightly better mix of overall products that were shipped in the quarter. That combined gave us that new record gross profit margin of 58.4%.","As we look into fourth quarter, I would not characterize our guidance suggesting that margins go up. We will be reducing loading some in the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis. Hence you can expect that margins will be down a bit, not very much, but down just a little bit.","So depending on how you're building your model there I wouldn\u2019t assume margins increase in fourth quarter. ","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Got it. ","Dave Pahl","Yeah. Thank you Stacy and we will go to the next caller.","Operator","Our next caller is Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the solid quarterly execution. The markets have been focused on Europe and China as sources of potential weakness. At the same time the team has done a solid job on diversification and maybe that\u2019s what it is, the diversity of forging a more stable revenue profile.","But at the margin, can you just talk about the overall health by geographies. Have you seen any signs of weakening above the normal seasonal trends that you would normally expect during Q3 or Q4?","Dave Pahl","Yeah, sure Harlan. I would say if you just look at what happened regionally, year-over-year Asia and Europe were both up while the U.S. was even and Japan was down a little bit. And sequentially all the regions were up with Asia and Europe up the most. ","And if you look specifically inside of China and how resales had done there, we had looked into that. And I'd just say that resales really just continued to be solid as we closed out the quarter. So that\u2019s basically what we saw. You have a follow-up?","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that. You gave us some trends in OpEx into the fourth quarter. How should we think about OpEx as we move into the first half of next year?","Kevin March","Harlan, I won't comment on first half, but I will give you some thoughts on first quarter. Your best way to analyze that, this could take a look at what happened from fourth quarter to first quarter of the most recent year coming out of 2013, 2012.","We do have seasonal increases in OpEx as we go from fourth to first typically because of an absence of vacations that we have in fourth and the partial implementation of our annual pay and benefit increases that occur in first. So they will -- you should expect those to be up and you can take a look at -- again this past year to get a rough idea as about how much that increased by in percentage terms. ","Dave Pahl","Yeah. And I would just add, Harlan, that the -- as we indicated before, Kevin pointed out that we are expecting about $15 million more savings in fourth quarter at that point will be essentially complete on those announced actions. So, we will basically be just have a seasonal impact that Kevin had mentioned.","All right, thank you. We will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Next caller is Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. I will start off with a bigger picture question, Kevin. The company has done a very good job of looking forward and being proactive, taking action to either prune lower margin revenue stream such as wireless or identifying opportunities for cost savings such as the optimization program this year.","As you look ahead how much further room is there for a similar such optimization efforts? Are we really at a point where the TI model is getting very close to being optimized?","Kevin March","Yeah, Craig. I think that as we look forward from an optimization standpoint, I think the ones you've talked about so far have been more about where we might have trimmed areas that had opportunities perhaps not quite as attractive as other areas. ","I think perhaps one of the areas least appreciated as people look at TI on a go forward basis is the impact that continued delta revenue on 300 millimeter analog is going to have for us. The cost structure to build on 300 millimeter is very attractive. And so incremental revenue going forward on 300 millimeter, we expect to produce not only higher margins, but also higher levels of total cash on that delta revenue.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow on Craig?","Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Co.","Yeah, I do. Thank you. Dave, you mentioned the strength in analog power management on year-on-year basis. Was it similarly strong sequentially and what specifically is driving that strength?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. So on a sequential basis if you look at our analog business it was up primarily due to High Volume Analog & Logic, as well as Power Management. Though we did see growth really from all four businesses, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley also grew. So, you see a little bit of difference there sequentially. But again power continue to strong in both comparisons. ","Okay, thank you, Craig. We will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS Securities, LLC.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities, LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to draw down little bit on the embedded processing segment, in particular between micro-processors and micro-controllers and I guess DSPs and application processors. ","Could you talk about some of the trends that you saw in Q3 especially from any, I guess, communications equipment exposure that you have?","Dave Pahl","Okay. So embedded processing, as you know grew 6% from a year ago. That was driven by micro-controllers, connectivity and processors each growing by about the same amount. And again as Kevin pointed out that was the eight quarter in a row of year-over-year growth. ","Sequentially, revenue was a little better than even, connectivity was up and processors and micro-controllers were about even sequentially. So, you have follow on Stephen?","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities, LLC","Yes. In terms of gross margins, I'm just wondering if this year there is an opportunity for you to take advantage of building any strategic inventory for certain products that you know have good turnover and hence maybe further optimize gross margins a little bit in a seasonally slower quarter. Thanks.","Kevin March","Yeah, Stephen, we do that on ongoing basis. That\u2019s one of the ways that we\u2019re able to keep sort of lead-time for the overwhelming majority of our parts to six weeks or less. In fact, we build the stock not necessarily build the order. Meaning, we maintain a stock of inventory such that we can always have short lead-times from our customers. So from a strategic standpoint that is done. ","It does have a little bit of ebb and flow. As you point out, when we have lower loadings in certain quarter it gives us chance to build up on feed extra parts on that. But I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot of opportunity to do that just to impact the gross margins. I think we're really doing that to impact customer service.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. And I would also add, Stephen that if you take the combined way that we are managing inventory now and we're being very intentional specific targeted programs depending on how quickly that inventory turns.","But you take that plus the open capacity that we've got and the combination of those two things and we've really been able to execute at very high levels and deliver our products on time to customers. And so we think not only having low lead-times but also delivering product when you make a commitment to a customer, combination of those things are what customers would like to have.","Okay. Thank you. We move on to the next caller please.","Operator","Next we have Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Can you talk about where your fab utilizations are now just qualitatively and there's still an underutilization charge to -- as part of these numbers?","Kevin March","Joe on the underutilization charges, the answer is yes there are. But we're not really talking about those anymore and the reason is really kind of straight forward. We found that analysts and some inventories where on a conclusion that because we had underutilization that increase in our utilization would be the maximum amount by which we could increase our overall profitability if we put revenue into those factories, and that\u2019s really an incomplete answer.","Remind you that our stated strategy is to invest in our capacity ahead of demand by definition. That means we will have open capacity and underutilization cost. Our purpose of providing ahead of demand is to purchase that capacity with as little cash as possible. ","So the utilization charge is mostly a non-cash charge and it tends to mix the point that our objective is to maximizing free cash flow. So for that reason you haven't really heard us commenting on or quantifying underutilization charges this past few quarters and unlikely to in the future unless there is some material changes that causes the better understanding of what's going on.","Dave Pahl","And Joe, I will just add, the last time we had stated our end-to-end capacity, it was in the $18 billion range. So if you want to get a qualitative feel of where capacity is, you can annualize our quarterly revenues and put it against that number and it will get you into the zip code. So you have a follow on Joe?","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Thank you for that. In terms, could you give us an update on the base station market? And I know you said that continue to be strong. Just anything that you are seeing from that end market?","Dave Pahl","Well, if I just look at the communications market overall and I would -- from a year-on-year standpoint it was up primarily due to wireless infrastructure, while sequentially it was down. And basically we just saw that in -- as a seasonal pause in the fourth quarter. So thank you very much\u2026","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Dave Pahl","And we go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next caller is Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Dave Pahl","Hi Vivek.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned a very interesting thing on improving output from your 300 millimeter fab and I was wondering if you could give us some more color around what percentage of your starts are moving to that fab?","And more importantly what that implies for gross margins? For example in the past you have mentioned about 75% fall through on gross margin. So as you increase the loading on 300 millimeter, what does that do to that number over the next several quarters or years?","Kevin March","Yeah, Vivek. I don\u2019t know that I'm prepared to give you a detailed quantification of that nature. What I would just say is that, we've talked in past about -- just from the geometrics alone that the chip cost itself was about 30% lower on 300 millimeter than it is on 200.","Not to mention that you also get better yield results and so on, so you get a number of different benefits. So what we are seeing happening is proportionally more and more new products that we're releasing are being released on to 300 millimeter, which means as we look out over the next year, two, three, four years, more and more of our revenue will be sourced off of 300 millimeter, which inherently means it's got lower cost which should allow us to incrementally increase our gross margins as well as our importantly our free cash flow. ","Beyond that I don\u2019t have any specifics I will give you at this point in time. But I do want to introduce that confidence to people because I think it's been underestimated as to how important that to TI's continued progress.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Dave Pahl","You've got follow on Vivek?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Dave, the question is on the end market mix, I believe, you mentioned comps was strong on year-on-year basis. I was wondering if you could just give us your end market mix overall for Q3 and how do you see those trends playing out in Q4? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Sure. Yeah. So on a year-on-year basis our revenue growth was due to coms equipment, industrial and automotive, as I mentioned before, each of which grew and contributed to that growth by about the same amount. ","Our Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personnel electronics declined due to legacy wireless products. So, if you kind of go down one step in each side of -- inside of each one of those, industrial, we've got about a dozen sectors inside of industrial. ","And as we've talked to different investors over the last few months and as we are traveling around, it becomes clear to us that our definition of industrial probably isn\u2019t as well understood. And we've got -- years ago we used to define it as what it wasn\u2019t, meaning it wasn\u2019t coms equipment or it wasn\u2019t automotive or it wasn\u2019t other things.","But now we've got very intentional definitions. We've got about a dozen different sectors that make that up. So things like appliances and building automation and displays and point-of-sale products, factory automation, industrial transportation, medical healthcare, fitness, lighting, motor drives, power infrastructure, things like that. So very, very broad, but very specific. ","So when you look on year-on-year basis, we had growth in nearly all of those sectors with most of the sectors actually providing double-digit growth. It was actually led by medical and healthcare fitness and factory automation. But, again, we saw that growth very broad based.","Automotive, we've got five sectors inside of that and I'll also just point that those sectors are actually out on our website of people are interested. But we've got double-digit in all the sectors, but led by passive, safety and infotainment. ","Coms equipment, as I mentioned, was up due to wireless infrastructure. Personnel electronic was down due to legacy wireless products and if you take that out we did see growth in PC and notebooks and mobile phones and that was partially offset by some weakness that we saw in gaming.","And then the enterprise systems, that\u2019s -- part of that is where our DLP products will sit and that was up due to projectors. So I will stop there. So thank you Vivek. We have a follow-up question?","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, that was my\u2026","Dave Pahl","Yeah, thank you very much. We will go to the next caller. Thanks so much for that.","Operator","Our next caller is Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, historically, when you saw lead-times stretch for some of your competitors, not -- even if you are only time stayed stable, you would see not only double ordering at your competitors, but also double ordering at Texas Instruments as well. ","And I'm wondering if you think something is changed structurally with how guys are running the business or how that industrial operates that might have changed that dynamic?","Kevin March","Yeah, Mark. I don\u2019t know that I will speak for the industry, but I will speak for TI and kind of go back to comment we made earlier. As a result of us taking an approach whereby we intentionally invested capacity before we needed and therefore always have more capacity that was needed for that quarter's business. It allows us to be able to build inventory in a much more thoughtful fashion than we have in the past. ","A consequence of that has been that not only have we've been able to maintain lead-times for the preponderance of our products that\u2019s six weeks or less for several years now, we've also been able to maintain a very high level of on time delivery to our customers against those lead-times.","So when you put that together, what you've really got for TI is it's just a different way whereby we are managing our manufacturing footprint and how we utilize that manufacturing for purposes of managing inventory. ","As it relates to double ordering, again, one of the biggest things that tends to be evident when double orderings begins to popup as you start seeing cancellations or reschedulings beginning to ramp up. We do not see that and we have not seen that for some time now. ","So I think the strategy whereby we have capacity ahead of demand and we use that thoughtfully to make sure that we can maintain relatively low lead-times is severing well to satisfying our customers at least as it relates to demand for our products.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-up Mark?","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Yes, I do. And that\u2019s helpful, Kevin. And the follow-up is actually on that topic about the lead-times. I think earlier in the script you said you're delivering -- you are focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. And then I think you said, you followed that up with saying we are keeping lead-times consistently low.","So, I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile when you say delivering higher levels of customer service, are you -- do you think that you have your lead-times over maybe a longer period of time have come end that they're just structurally shorter? Or are you just delivering them more consistently at a shorter time.","So I just have to reconcile when you said, what is the higher level of customer service? What is the improvement have been? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for clarification. I think it\u2019s a real good question. So when we referred of that, we look at a bunch of different customer service metrics. One is just how many line items are we shipping on time and we've had some very intentional initiatives that have been set up to be able to ensure that that is a good solid number and we are taking advantage of both the capacity and our inventory to ensure that we are consistently delivering on time.","And so that\u2019s one of the metrics that we look at and that\u2019s what we mean by customer service, it's not really changing those lead-times, but keeping them stable and then delivering products when we saw that we'll deliver them. It's really the combination of those two things. ","So thanks Mark, and we will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back, Kevin, on gross margin, if you could just go through what drove the offside versus your guidance, then you're obviously sustaining that going forward. Is there anything that doesn\u2019t repeat in such that --and it sounds like you can grow it off this space. Just want to make sure I heard that right. ","Kevin March","Yeah, Blayne, the guidance actually -- we are up a little bit from guidance, not a huge amount. But really what we have was little bit more revenue come through. But importantly we also have a slightly better mix of product that we ship to our customer. And so combined that gave us a slightly higher gross margin than previous expected.","And then on a go forward basis, again, that mix continues to be in our favor as we go forward and so consequently as we look into fourth quarter our margins will continue to be quite strong. ","And importantly, because of the rather unique situation that we have with 300 millimeter analog manufacturing capacity, we have significant opportunity to continue to drive not just improved margins but importantly good cash flow.","Again, I will remind you some of the things that we do. We've got 300 millimeter analog. I do want to make that point of having it. We've got a lot more of our revenue coming from catalog parts which inherently tend to have more attractive margin characteristics.","We have increasing portions of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive spaces and those three concepts are pretty important. Catalog parts, industrial, automotive tend to have very nice long revenue streams, which means we have plenty of time to figure out and maximize our cost efficiency from production standpoint and maximize our revenue and cash flow off that.","Now, we've got increasing customer diversity. So our dependence on any one customer and therefore of the risk to our loadings or cash flow generation are diminished. And perhaps also very importantly we have a sales force that we estimate to be three to four times larger than our nearest competitors and those folks are becoming increasingly productive.","And so we're beginning to get a lot more revenue per sales person which means we can grow revenue without having to grow OpEx as fast as revenues growing. Those things combined not only will help our margins, but also definitely help our cash flow. ","Dave Pahl","Okay. Blayne, you have a follow-up question? ","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Yeah, thanks. So just for a big picture level, I think you already answered this, but I just wanted to make sure I missed anything. We've had seen some companies referenced part still weaknesses. I mean, I would say your results are normal, if not even better than normal. ","Are you seeing any areas that are weak and you are offsetting that with share gains or strength elsewhere? Just curious your perspective or are you not seeing any weakness at all anywhere?","Dave Pahl","Well, yeah, I will let you draw the conclusions from the numbers. I think that, obviously, the results are solid. I think that the outlook is consistent with the orders and our visibility into what customers are telling us they want from a consignment standpoint. So -- and from a share gain standpoint, I think that we've had multiple years now where we have had gain share, think it's always hard to tell in any one particular quarter that you're picking up share, but I think when you look back over a year, you can see that trend. So, we believe in our numbers, there share gains, but I'd be careful and anyone quarter to be able to point that out.","So, thank you Blayne. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the one segment nobody has asked about thus far is other, did a bit better than I had expected. Dave you broke down what was the year-over-year and sequentials with the sub buckets in the other two segments. Can you do that for the other segment as well? And if it is DLP, give us a little description on is there some seasonality in that that we need to appreciate going forward? Thanks.","Dave Pahl","Sure, sure. Thanks Ross. Yeah, so on a year-on-year basis, again, other was even. We saw a decline in legacy wireless products and that was mostly offset by the growth in DLP products.","On a sequential basis -- let me just finish year-on-year. If you look beyond that, calculators as well as custom ASIC business were up and royalties were down just slightly. So sequentially, revenue was up due to growth in calculators and DLPs. Royalties were flat and custom ASIC was down a little bit.","So, I'd say that all of those businesses are performing well and if you look at DLP, they are typically stronger in the back half of the year in third quarter, but I would say that business is just executing well.","When we look at that business longer term, I describe that it's got several wildcard growth opportunities. If you look at most of the business today, it will be centered up in the front projectors that you'll typically see in offices and schools and government buildings, but -- and it also has a solid cinema business, but from a broader standpoint, it's some opportunities inside of automotive as well as some embedded opportunities there as well.","Kevin March","Pico as well.","Dave Pahl","Yeah, the Pico projectors as well. So, thanks Ross, do you have a follow-up?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","I do. Kevin you were helpful in giving us some balance around the OpEx and looking at prior years and how things have dropped seasonally due to vacations et cetera in both the fourth and in the first quarter doing the other direction.","Can you give us a little bit of a harder number on what that typical percentage changes quarter-to-quarter? Looking back in the past you guys have had a number of restructuring programs that make it a little bit difficult to parse out what seasonality and what is restructuring driven in both the fourth of the first quarter? Thank you.","Kevin March","Yeah, Ross I actually pointed to the last fourth to first transition with the idea, that's a good one for you to look at because in fact the timing of the announcement for the embedded process and Japan restructuring, you may remember we announced that in January of this past year, so we hadn't even begun the activities yet inside the first quarter. So, the underlying cost in there is fairly clean from a competitive standpoint between fourth and first and so I'd use that as your figure of (merit) [ph] to trying to figure where we go in 2014.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thanks Ross. That was helpful clarification. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next caller is Doug Friedman with RBC Capital.","Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for taking my--","Dave Pahl","Hi Doug.","Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a real strong results here. If I could Kevin maybe attack really high level one. You guys have been in the past very acquisitive so much so that you really rebuild your whole business model through acquisitions. Can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe add some debt onto your already leveraged balance sheet? And what it would take for you to look at another significant deal?","Kevin March","Okay, Doug it's not like may be there's two ideas in your question, one on M&A, one on debt. Clearly, on the M&A front, as you point out, we have been quite willing to take on M&A activities when it makes sense and our definition of what makes sense firstly has to be a strategic fit meaning that it really has to make sense for why we want to take the company.","As we look at potential M&A in the future, it's most likely to be biased towards analog and probably towards items with catalog parts, service the industrial or automotive spaces. There may be others, but those are the most likely areas that we would look at.","If it turns out that it checks off that strategic fit standpoint and of course, we'll have to take a look at the numbers and make sure that the price that we would pay met -- what I mean by that is not necessarily what its market cap is but the market we probably have to pay on top of that, that that total cost would be accretive to our lack or way the average cost of capital in the two to four year timeframe. So, there's the several test that we go through and we will make a termination on acquisition.","As it relates to debt, as you know we have taken on debt to support acquisitions in the past. We think having the balance sheet available to support those kinds of strategic initiatives are important and a worthwhile thing for us to maintain for maximum flexibility as we move forward and so as we look out in time and even look at the last couple of years, while we have been issuing new debt, we've also been retiring older debt and retiring a little bit faster than what we've been issuing so that we're taking our whole debt levels down that's having the result of generally slowly opening the balance sheet back up to make itself available for any other opportunity that might present itself at some point in the future. So, that's how we're looking at M&A and that's how debt kind of roles inside that book.","Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for all that color.","Dave Pahl","Do you have a follow-up?","Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, I guess if I could, can you guys pretty much along the same ideas on the balance sheet and how you look at cash return, I might have missed it did you happen to give out the share price at which you bought back shares this quarter? And would you moderate going forward given the share price pullback that we just saw, how we should think about share count going forward?","Kevin March","Let's see, we bought back $670 million worth of shares this quarter, total of 14.1 million shares, so that's an average price of about $47.62. I would point out that over the last -- since the end of 2004 beginning 2005, we reduced our total share count by 39% that the average price of those shares that we bought over that time, I believe were about $30.62 give or take.","When we look to buy back shares as we talked about in the past when the intrinsic value we believe was higher than what the market value is, then it makes sense to buyback on a steady, if you will, dollar across averaging kind of basis, that's what we've done for many years and that's what you've seen us do here recently.","In fact, the recent pullback in price is just allowing us to buyback a few more shares with the same number of dollars. So, that's kind of a round the world look at share repurchase if you will. That answers your question on that Doug?","Dave Pahl","Yeah. Thank you, Doug. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Following Doug, we have Will Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Humphrey Robinson","Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'm hoping you can quantify a comment that you made earlier about the portion of sales on 300 millimeter today and that could increase over time. Kevin could you talk a little bit about where that number is now and where you'd see going over the next couple of years?","Kevin March","Yes, Will, I think we're going to try to just hold back and say it is proportionally more than it has -- each period that goes by is proportionally more, but I think that we'll hold at a little while longer till we can get a more comprehensive look and better understanding for everybody on how to think about that 300 going forward.","I just do think that it's -- again the highest level it\u2019s a fairly straightforward competition. 30% lower dye cost which means about 50% lower total -- total IC cost. And as we get proportionally more revenue going on there that will just incrementally benefit our margins on our cash flows as we go forward in time. That is something that I've become aware of and talking to investors the last couple of quarters that is underappreciated and what's going on inside the portfolio itself.","William Stein - SunTrust Humphrey Robinson","That's helpful. Appreciate it. And as my follow-up, another comment that was made earlier was about I think the relative strength of analog versus the embedded segment this quarter and I think there was a comment about end markets, the end market mix helping, I am wondering if you could quantify that? Maybe help us understand of the better. I know analog is very diversified relative to embedded, but maybe talk about if they were maybe some end markets that were a bit more challenging that effectively embedded segment a bit more?","Dave Pahl","Yes, I think if you look at embedded, it will have a high exposure to really three different markets. Its communications, equipment, industrial and automotive and like you said our analog business has a much broader exposure including exposure to personal electronics. It has obviously good exposure to industrial and automotive as well, but it's really those types of differences that will explain that performance.","If you look at embedded processing and you look back at the growth rates between the two businesses, you'll note that often times they will grow at different rates. But if you look over that eight quarter period that embedded processing has been growing year-over-year, the growth rate for both of those businesses are essentially -- exactly the same, so kind of works out that way over a longer period of time.","So, thank you Will, and we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","The next question comes from Tore Svanberg.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, good afternoon Dave and Kevin. My first question is on sort of the general environment, Q4 is obviously a seasonally down quarter anyway, it's hard to get a read on what's going on. But as we sort of -- or as you talk to your customers and we compare now let's say versus 12 months ago, would you classify the forecast in the environment as a better, weaker or about the same?","Kevin March","Tory I guess I probably say that it's about the same. I wouldn't classify it is better or weaker, I said it about the same in that -- again we have had the same lead-times for several years and customers are ordering consistent with that generally speaking. You get some of expert from time-to-time because they've under-ordered or have a surprise on their but that was true a year ago and it's probably true today.","And we continue to see customers manage their inventories of our products as they have early as was mentioned earlier and the distribution channel, we're at all-time lows a 4.5 weeks of inventory that's same last quarter and this quarter that's very low.","From a customer standpoint, we see them again ordering lead-time and consistent ordering patterns so that tells us they are order -- they are keeping their inventories very low. So, I think overall I probably characterize it as relatively the same kind of customer demeanor today as what we saw a year ago.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, thanks Kevin, that's very helpful. My follow-up question Dave, if I have one.","Dave Pahl","Sure. Please.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. So, your annual growth 10% year-over-year is that the goal internally to continue to grow the analog business 10% every year or was there anything unusual here the last 12 months that kept that growth rate so high?","Dave Pahl","Well, I would say that internally we have very aggressive goals to grow the businesses and I just describe that as we want to outgrow the market significantly in analog, so we have got all the business units that are focused up on that.","We do look at the performance of the product lines every quarter and we really look at a three-year compounded annual growth rate and stack that up against all the other businesses both inside of TI as well as competitors externally and that's how we measure it.","So, again as I've said earlier a 10% we believe would represent some share gain, but it would be real cautious to look at anyone quarter and draw the conclusion or try to dice out what percentage of that growth would be from share gains.","So, okay thank you Tory and we\u2019ll -- operator, I think we've got time for one more caller.","Operator","Yes sir. And we have CJ Muse with ISI Group.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question it's a point of clarification on the OpEx outlook for Q4 down $15 million, is that all restructuring and then there's gravy on top of that in terms of seasonal savings or is that $15 million include the seasonal savings?","Kevin March","CJ, the thing here to do is take a look at year ago third quarter, fourth quarter there was a seasonal decrease. On top of that will be another $15 million as the last rest of the EP restructuring is completed.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess second question, I was hoping you could talk about inventories downstream. Clearly relatively healthy on your books, but would love to hear what your thoughts are in terms of -- in particular at the [disty] level?","Dave Pahl","Yes. Our inventories really from a day standpoint have remained unchanged at what I would just describe historically low levels, just a little over four and a half weeks. Again, that number is low because of the consignment programs that we have put in place.","Beyond our distributors and into our customers, we do have a good percentage of our revenues on consignment overall and in fact, if you combine what we shipped through distribution as well as what we ship to OEMs on consignment that represents about 50% or about half of our revenues where we actually there is no inventory sitting in front of us and that manufacturing line for those inventories. So, we know that inventory number and it is zero.","So, we have very good visibility into that portion and we do have a balance of the business that's kind of the classic -- I'll describe it as book ship type business where they give us an order and goes on to a backlog and we ship it at lead-time. So, -- and there we haven't seen any reports of large inventory pockets from customers, we're going through and racking up this quarter's results and we will see what happens on that front but we're not aware of any big pockets that are downstream.","So, okay well thank you very much CJ for your question. Thank you all for joining us today and a replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation."],"20000":["Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Dave Pahl - Vice President of Investor Relations","Rafael Lizardi - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs","Chris Danley - Citigroup","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Q1 2019 earnings release call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I will be covering the following topics. First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the first quarter. Second, I will provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end-market. And third, I will include some additional color in light of the market weakness we are currently experiencing. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results, a brief comment on the status of our next 300 millimeter fab, and then the outlook. Then, we will open the call for Q&A.","Now starting with the high-level summary of our first quarter financial results. The weakness in demand that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. The weakness was across all markets with the exception of communications equipment. In our core businesses, analog revenue declined 2% and embedded processing revenue declined 14% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses\u2019 year-on-year growth decelerated as we expected at this point in the cycle.","Similar to the fourth quarter, embedded remained weaker than analog, primarily because it didn't benefit from increasing content in 5G. Operating margin decreased in both businesses. Reduced factory loadings affected both businesses, but the impact was greater in analog since more of its supply comes from internal manufacturing. Overall revenue in the first quarter decreased 5% from a year ago and earnings per share were $1.26, including a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.","With that backdrop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners.","Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month period was $6 billion, up 22% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 32.1% from a year ago. We continued to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all our free cash flow to owners.","Moving on, I will now provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end-market and then offer some additional color on the market. From a year-ago quarter, analog revenue declined 2% due to high volume and power, partially offset by growth in signal chains. I will note that the strength in communications equipment minimized analog's decline. Embedded processing revenue declined by 14% from a year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, processors, and connected microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 6% from a year ago.","Now given the current weaker market environment, I wanted to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand for our products that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although communications equipment was stronger than expected due to shipments of products that support 5G.","Next, I will provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end-market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive declined mid-single digits due to broad-based weakness. We continue to focus our investments across 13 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to believe these investments will deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term.","Personal electronics declined low double digits due to broad-based weakness, including mobile phones and PCs. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 30% year-on-year, and as we mentioned earlier, benefiting both from 5G shipments as well as an easy compare due to weakness in the year ago period. History would suggest that we should expect this market to be choppy in the future. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. Looking at these end-markets on a regional basis, generally all the regions performed consistently, excluding the positive effects of communications equipment.","So in summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and they also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.26 billion or 62.9% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 170 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $803 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.7% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long term. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.","Operating profit was $1.38 billion or 38.4% of revenue. Operating profit was down 11% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 43.2%, down from 45.4% a year ago and for embedded processing was 31.3%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Net income in the first quarter was $1.22 billion, or $1.26 per share, which included a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $251 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.99 billion. In the first quarter, we paid $724 million in dividends and repurchased $1.15 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.88 billion.","In total, we have returned $8.05 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.09 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%.","Inventory days were 144, up eight days from a year ago and down eight days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the second quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and will manage it with our long-term objectives in mind.","Next, as we mentioned earlier, we want to update you on our next 300 millimeter wafer fab. As you may have seen, we have chosen Richardson, Texas, as the site for our next wafer fab. The new building will be on our existing site in Richardson. We have not announced a specific construction timetable yet, but as we indicated during the February Capital Management call, we would expect to get started in the next few years.","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.46 billion to $3.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.32, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% in 2019.","In closing, as we said last quarter, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We have just completed our second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. If you look at history, cycles are always different, but typically the industry would have four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. We are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective.","Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term, while remaining diligent in the short term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. I am kind of thinking how to interpret your Q2 outlook. One interpretation is that you are not really seeing much recovery off of Q1, right, which is kind of surprising when we hear of China PMI improving and all the optimism about some signs of recovery. The other interpretation is that maybe Q1 you saw the extra benefit from comm equipment. So if I exclude that, then you are seeing some modest pickup going into Q2. So I am just curious, how are you thinking about your Q2 outlook versus seasonally, which is supposed to be up 7%, 8% sequentially?","Dave Pahl","Yes. Vivek, I would say, certainly, I can confirm the first part of the question that in first quarter, we did get a benefit from comms equipment. That's just in the numbers. I think when we look at our second quarter outlook and we put that together, again we base that on the orders that we get from customers as well as the demand feeds that we get through our consignment programs. And just as a reminder, about two-thirds of our revenue comes through those consignment programs.","And for OEMs, we will typically get six months of visibility and there is no inventory that sits in front of us in that manufacturing line. So, it really is one of the best signals that we can get. And I also would caution that that doesn't mean that that signal can't change very quickly. So, that's how we are basing the guidance for the second quarter, and I will leave further interpretation to you.","Do you have follow-up?","Vivek Arya","Yes. Thanks Dave. So maybe if I ask the question in a different way. Have you seen any pickup in orders over the last few weeks versus let's say the first few weeks of the year?","Dave Pahl","Well, I would say that orders behaved normally in the quarter. And again, two-thirds of our revenue is coming through on consignment. So, we will get an order when that product is due to ship and that happens instantaneously. So, orders are probably less of the strongest signal that we will get versus those demand signals that we get from orders.","So, thank you, Vivek. And we will go to next caller please.","Operator","We will go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Rafael, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the utilization actions you are taking? How much of a hit were they to the calendar first quarter gross margins? And I guess more importantly, I know it takes time for utilization actions to go through the P&L, but have the utilization rates now bottomed and how do you think about utilization relative to Q2 gross margins and going throughout the remainder of the year?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me try to frame that for you a little bit. Over the last couple of quarters, we have talked about how we are going to decrease our wafer starts to adjust to the expectations of revenue, while at the same time we are going to increase the portion or a dedicate portion of those wafers to building our low-volume industrial consignment or industrial buffer parts, and also the transition to consignment. So, we did those things and our operating plan did reduce, and we did take a hit to gross margins in that process, and that's what you are seeing in our P&L.","Now what I would sort of take you back to is look at it from a free cash flow standpoint, because ultimately that's what matters, right. What you are seeing from a utilization charges standpoint is a non-cash expense. At the end of the day, what we are focused on is allocating capital and allocating cash, right. So, by decreasing those wafer starts, what we did was dedicating less cash to that.","So in fact, leaving out more cash for the owners of the company, but generating enough inventory or the right amount of inventory to be prepared for the revenue that we want to meet in the future, and also to build those buffer inventory stocks so that we are prepared for future quarters and have the ability to meet customer expectations and customer satisfaction, which ultimately is what we are trying to do with that inventory so that it helps us position ourselves to meet those customer demands and help with our goal of continuing to grow the topline for a long time to come. ","Dave Pahl","Yes. Just a number on that, I think if you look at our first quarter, trailing 12-month free cash flow is at 38.4%. That was the same that we had last quarter, so it didn't change much.","Do you have a follow-on, John?","John Pitzer","Yes. Dave, just going back to the revenue guidance for the calendar second quarter, if you look at how that business has historically performed, I think I need to go back to 2001 to see a calendar second quarter that was down sequentially, and that was sort of in the wake of the tech bubble. Again, I am just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the bottoms up business to potentially have a scenario when they are of down sequential revenue? And I guess you mentioned in your prepared comments that the comms business can be lumpy historically. Is embedded in the Q2 guidance still good lumpiness or would you expect that lumpiness in the comms sector?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So I would say, first, if you look over, and you know this very well, John, if you look over 10, 15, 25 years of the comms equipment market, that business is lumpy. It's lumpy because of the way that operators put out tenders and place the orders and the OEMs, our customers, have to build to those. So history just says that you should be mindful of that and that doesn't make it a bad business. It's just an attribute of it.","And so, I think in the second quarter, I would remind you that we just completed the second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. It's not likely that cycles, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, can last four or five quarters. Sometimes, they can be shorter and sometimes they can be longer than that, but we are two quarters into that. And per our practice, if there was something significant or unusual going on in our guidance, either by end-markets or a particular customer, we would make those things clear to help you understand it.","So, okay. Thank you, John. We will go to the next caller please.","Operator","We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Again, I want to push on the comm point a little bit. I know analog and embedded have diverged, partially because of this. If it wasn't for the upside on comm. and analog, do you think it would be seeing similar year-over-year trends without the strength in comm as well as in the embedded?","Dave Pahl","Yes. Stacy, they would be much closer. I think there are still some differences, but directionally all the end-markets are the same and they would maybe much closer from year-over-year decline standpoint.","Do you have a follow-on?","Stacy Rasgon","I do. Again, I want to follow-up still on comm. So we are seeing very strong ups I mean, I guess the first part of it is sort of I think you mentioned this that the upside versus guidance in the quarter that was all comm. So the rest of the business came in as expected. And I guess just secondly on how concerned are you, what's the possibility that the current strength we would see in comm is not actually matched and then ultimately worried about like order pull-forwards and most of the things from some of the larger customers? Like what are you seeing along those lines around the sustainability of the upside that we are seeing in comm now I guess over the medium to long term?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So I would say that the upside that we saw was almost all from comms. I think that the rest of the markets and businesses, if you looked at it from that way, performed about as we expected. And the comments on what the future of that looks like, I would just go back to the statements that we made before and just staring at history of that market it tends to be choppy.","So would we expect it to be choppy in the future? We would. That's not a comment on second quarter or third or fourth. It's just the comment of looking at history that that market just tends to be choppy.","So okay. Thank you Stacy. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We will go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, will your factory loadings go up sequentially in this quarter versus last quarter? Or are they going to be going down? I am try to understand if you believe inventories are going to be a source or use of cash this quarter?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. Last quarter we characterized that, because it was more relevant at the time given the inflection point on our revenue. Now that the midpoint of our revenue is about the same as the first quarter, I think it's time to just not focus on that and focus on the other things that we think are more important longer term, which is our ability to continue to grow the topline as we focus on analog and embedded industrial automotive.","And with that as we focus on growing free cash flow for the long-term, as Dave mentioned earlier and we mentioned during the call, despite the drop in gross margin and the drop in utilization, our free cash flow on the trailing 12-months was essentially unchanged from 90 days ago. And as a percent of revenue, it was 38.4%, right.","Dave Pahl","And I think that just speaks to the quality of the business model that topline can change quite a bit, but if you look at that trailing 12-months free cash flow, it just tends to be much more stable. And that just speaks to the quality of the model.","Mark, do have a follow on?","Mark Lipacis","Yes. Thank you. Dave, in your script you said, I may have misunderstood this, but you said that regionally the business trends were consistent except for communications equipment. I don't think I really quite understand that. I am hoping you can just spell that statement out for me? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","Yes. So that you can think of the largest manufacturers of communications equipment, we try not to go by customer of who those are. But there are only a couple of regions in which they exist. And so you can imagine that you can connect those two pieces of information together. So hopefully that helps.","Thank you Mark. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We will go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I had a follow-up on the comm segment. Dave, you talked about the business being up 30% year-over-year. What was embedded in your original guide for the first quarter?","Dave Pahl","Well again, I think that overall our revenue came within the range of our expected guidance. It was in the upper half primarily because of the strength that we saw in comms equipment.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Got it. And then as a quick follow-up for Rafael. I wanted to get an update on your thoughts on capital return. Your stock is back up to now quite your 52-week high, but pretty close. How should we think about buybacks versus dividends versus other uses of cash going forward? Thank you.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. And I am happy to address that, Toshiya. First let me take everybody back to our capital management strategy, the objective that we talk about. And when it comes to cash return, our objective there is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. And we think that we recognize that sometimes you strategically build cash, sometimes you strategically drain cash, right. So then you can actually return more than 100% of free cash flow, as frankly we have done for the last few years.","But on the two pieces, so dividends and buybacks. On dividends, the goal is to provide a sustainable and growing dividend and we target to be somewhere between 40% to 60% of free cash flow. At the moment, on the trailing 12-month basis, we are at 45%.","And then on the repurchases is the creative capture of future free cash flow for the long-term owners. But that essentially means, so let me dive a little deeper on repurchases because I think that's where your question is going. We use reasonable assumptions, not aggressive, not conservative, but reasonable assumptions of our expected growth of free cash flow per share for the company for a long time to come and then based on that, we develop our assessment on valuation of intrinsic value of the company. And then we compare that to their market price and depending on the divergence of those, we buy back.","So as long as this is below their intrinsic and higher than market price, we will be buying back shares and how much it depends on their divergence, right. So you can see our history of the last year-and-a-half or so. I mean we have been returning significantly more than 100% of free cash flow as we do that assessment. But as long as the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, we will buy back shares in the open market.","With that, do you have a follow-up?","Dave Pahl","No, that was his follow-up. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We will go next to Chris Danley with Citigroup.","Dave Pahl","I think he got muted.","Operator","Mr. Danley, your line is open.","Chris Danley","Yes. Hi guys. I heard that the operator came on. Anyway, my question is on trends over in China. Can you just comment on how the order trends have gone over there over the last three months? Have you seen any stabilization? And then any words you can give us on distribution inventory as well?","Dave Pahl","Yes. Chris, I would say that as we said in the prepared remarks that really all the regions performed similarly with the exception of comms equipment that we talked about. All of our markets were pretty consistent this quarter. Distributor inventories were up a little more than a day sequentially to just a little over four-and-a-half weeks.","Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Chris Danley","Yes I do. So a bit of a longer-term question. I will break with [indiscernible] them on the call. If we look at your \"other revenue\", it's like a 8% of sales now and the operating margin has been sort of steadily trending down over the last few years and I think in the most recent quarter was 15%. So it was about 25% below the corporate average. A, why is that operating margin so low? What's going on there? And then B, why not just start shutting down or ending life of those products?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. A couple of things on that. Recently, in this last quarter, we did have a decrease inside of that business within our DLP business but a lot of that was due to this consignment transition that we have talked about. So that's part of what drove the short-term and also maybe some of what the margin issue that you are attributing to.","I would also remind you that some of the acquisition charges for example, restructuring charges, that's all in that other piece. Remember, especially on the acquisition charge, that's non-cash. So elsewhere that represents cash that went out the door about eight years ago. So you adjust for that. That maybe gives you a better picture.","And lastly, we do have the customized piece there, couple of hundred million still left per year there and over the next two, three, four years that will trend to zero. The rest of the business should be fairly steady and inside of other.","Dave Pahl","Yes. And the other comment that I would make, Chris, you can see the seasonality of calculator not only in the revenues but you can see it in the operating margin. So almost all of those revenues come for back to school. So we will see that at the end of the second quarter and the beginning of third. But obviously, the expenses for that business carry out throughout the whole year. So always you will see because that revenue comes in, in that short period of time, the operating margins in those two quarters look much nicer.","And the last comment I will make and we kind of joke about, we should have come up with a more creative name for other, like other good stuff or something like that. So those businesses generate lots of cash for us. And they don't take a lot of resources to maintain them. So that's why they remain in the family.","So with that, I think we have got time for one more caller.","Operator","We will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Hi. I just had a question on the genesis that some of the inventory related weakness you are seeing. We saw last year some of the tightness of things that TI doesn't sell, like MLCC capacitors and things like that where the lead times got really inflated and clearly that's corrected now. I guess as you look back on that, do you think that that triggered inventory of TI components to get built? And where do you think we are in sort of that cycle playing its way through in terms of shortages of other components that TI can't control?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I think Joe that as you are describing it, that's kind of what drives semiconductor cycles, right. I think that if you think of a customer wherever they are in the world and they start to get notified from their suppliers and our peers that their lead times are going out, even though ours aren't going out, they may decide to proactively take their inventory position from six weeks to nine weeks over a 90-day period. And that will drive strength in the business overall and 90-days later they decide to go from nine weeks to 12 weeks of inventory, because things look like they are getting even tighter. And then, once they get comfortable, it moves back in the other way.","So as you watch that play out, we had 10 quarters of very strong growth. Most of that was double digit. I think most people when they looked at that would describe that as above trend and what follows 10 quarters of running above trend is a few quarters that will run below.","So you have follow-on, Joe?","Joe Moore","Yes. And I guess you may have touched on this and I missed it. But any change in your own lead times over the last three months?","Dave Pahl","Generally our lead times have remained stable. Even through the period of very strong demand, our lead times had remained stable. I think that you can always find pockets just as you can today where we will work with customers very aggressively to close. And I think another important metric that we track, Joe, is on time delivery and those have remained very, very high. Other customer service metrics remained very high. So meaning that, if someone does come and order products at lead time, are we shipping them to the commitments that we have got and those remained high through that whole cycle.","And some of the things that we are doing like building inventory of low volume parts during this peak period of weaker demand, we are doing that to ensure that we can continue to deliver product consistently to customers. That's really what's driving that. That and the visibility that we get through programs like consignment, kind of a combination of those things, we are actually doing other things around inventory positions and order entry and we have summarized that as really the belief that their strategic value in owning and controlling that inventory and keeping it on our balance sheet.","So with that, I will turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up for us.","Rafael Lizardi","All right. Thanks Dave. Let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember. First, as we mentioned last quarter, we will stay focused on what will make us stronger long term and diligent in the short term. Second, we will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products and industrial and automotive, the best markets. And third, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company.","A - Dave Pahl","Thank you and good night.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"19996":["Texas Instruments Inc. (NYSE:TXN) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2018  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Dave Pahl - VP & Head of IR","Rafael Lizardi - CFO","Analysts","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Chris Danley - Citigroup","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Ambrish Srivastava - Bank of Montreal","Chris Caso - Raymond James","Romit Shah - Nomura Instinet","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law.","With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago.","We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.","I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year-ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to Custom ASIC products.","Now, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong, with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew, with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined, but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.","As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectation of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional non-cash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete tax items.","To get you to an effective tax rate by quarter, for the balance of the year, we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters, and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You will find this information summarized on our IR website under financial summary data as we have done in the past.","And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law, and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018.","In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion, or 64.6% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $818 million, a 1% increase from a year ago and about as expected. R&D grew 4 % and SG&A was about even. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.","Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.55 billion, or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago.","Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion, or $1.35 per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12 month basis, up 17% from a year ago.","In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range.","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.","In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top-line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products.","We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks Rafael, operator, you can open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and consistent execution. For my first question, since you guys have such a wide perspective on the global economy, I was wondering if you could give us a sense on what you are seeing versus for example what you might have thought at the start of the year. Are you noticing any areas of slow down or pause or anything because your Q1 results are very strong, Q2 is above consensus expectations perhaps sequentially it's not what it has been in the past. So just broadly what you're seeing in the economy versus what you thought three months ago?","Rafael Lizardi","Let me -- I will start with that and then Dave, you want to chime in on that. But I will tell you from a global standpoint, but we're seeing a very continued -- that the macro economy continues to be constructive although uncertainties have been introduced clearly with the -- in the geopolitical area. With everything going on that we read in the news. Now it's too soon is that -- what that impact is going to be on the macro level. From what's important though on a year -- from a year ago basis we continue to see strength in industrial and automotive, as Dave highlighted in his prepared remarks. Personal electronics grew across several sectors and while communications equipment declined, it was [above reasonable] sequentially. Dave.","Dave Pahl","I think Vivek when you look at the quarter with revenue increasing 11%, the demand continuing to remain strong in both industrial and automotive and I just described that demand is continuing to be very broad-based. So I think that speaks to you. One of our competitive advantages which is diversity and longevity of products, so we're certainly benefiting from that today. Do you have a follow on, Vivek?","Vivek Arya","CapEx its up 42% on a trailing 12 month basis running ahead of revenue growth that's closer to 5% or 6% up there versus the 4% target. I'm curious why is CapEx growing so much faster when you're only 50% utilized in your 300 millimeter factory? I mean should we look at growing CapEx as a sign of confidence in demand or at what point should we be worried that maybe you are going to buy too much inventory?","Rafael Lizardi","I will give you a few -- a few things on that. First most importantly let's step back and think about what is the purpose of CapEx. We talked about this during our capital management strategy a couple of months ago. In CapEx our objective there is to support technology development and revenue growth. We want to expand our low cost manufacturing advantage specially to the 300 millimeter where the only analog company with its own 300 millimeter factory and what that does at the end of the day is allow us to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth. So that's what the ultimate objective is. The CapEx percent of revenue that's just a general guide that we gave.","And on that our sense is that 4% that could vary depending on what's going on in the marketplace, because of very strong demand, when we are expanding capacity, that could run off. And right now on a trailing 12 months basis 4.9%. But of course the reason that would run off is that we see opportunities to continue expanding our technology development and our low cost manufacturing advantage so that ultimately we drive long-term growth of our free cash flow per share.","Dave Pahl","Thank you, for that and we can go to the next caller please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","First I wanted to ask about OpEx, in Q1 it was -- it grew but probably a little less than with ordinarily be typical sequentially. Were there any specific drivers to that maybe push out of spend maybe into Q2 and I guess along those lines Q2 OpEx would usually up a little bit? Any change that we should expect from what will be typical there?","Rafael Lizardi","On OpEx on first quarter, it came in about as expected and we continue to be pleased with how we are allocating capital to OpEx in general, specifically to our R&D as it continues to drive growth in the top line and we continue to gain market share. On the subsequent quarter as you know, we gave a range on revenue and EPS we don't give in between the lines. If there was something unusual going on we would point that out, we are not pointing out because there is nothing unusual going on in between those lines.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-on Stacy?","Stacy Rasgon","I wanted to ask about the [Technical Difficulty] grew year-over-year. I was also surprised just given what we've heard from other players in that space right now. Could you give us a little more color, I think you said like in certain segments could you give us a little more color about what's actually going on under the covers in personal electronics? And I guess, whether or not you see the current trends actually extending into next quarter given what is going on in the supply chain?","Rafael Lizardi","Let me talk about this quarter that we are reporting and wait for second quarter results to go through the details there. We described that we saw growth across several sectors and several customers, so you know that we tried to point out there it is not just the insets that are growing there are other things are growing inside of that. And I will describe the growth as somewhere in the mid to single-digit. So good growth, especially for a sector like personal electronics. Long-term of course, we think that we will see auto and industrial driver business that where we've been allocating increasingly our capital too. And that's just the belief that those will be the two areas that will drive growth not just for us but certainly in our industry overall.","Operator","Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","On inventory Dave I think Q1 inventory grew about 4% sequentially. I think days inventory grew a little bit as well. Can you describe how you guys see internal inventory today? And if you can comment on the channel, where you guys are seeing the channel that will be helpful as well?","Rafael Lizardi","I'll talk about internal inventory and then Dave will talk about channel inventory. But on inventory let me step back again and refer you to our long-term objective that we talked about at the capital management call. What do we want inventory for? The objective of our inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence, improve our manufacturing asset utilization and we also see value in controlling that inventory, having more of it in our own product distribution centers, more in consignment, more in low-volume buffers. I talked about this at the capital management call as well as 90 days ago when we closed the last quarter and this topic came up. So we're very pleased where our inventory ended up. From a day space as it was 136 days, from a year ago that's up 4 days, sequentially is up 2 days and is well within our 115, 145 day inventory basement.","Dave Pahl","And Toshiya from a channel standpoint inventory remains at about 4 weeks and I will just as a reminder for those that are not familiar as Rafael pointed out there is -- we believe that there is value in owning and controlling our own inventory, and actual result is in the consignment program. So, about 65% of our distribution revenue is shipped through a consignment program, so that 4 weeks really represents maybe half to third of what many of our peers will run in the channel. So we feel that's a good level. That combined with the inventory positions that we have on our books. Do you have a follow on Toshiya?","Toshiya Hari","I do thank you. So on communications equipment specifically I think 3 months ago, you guys talked about the business being a little bit choppy and today I guess you told us that revenues were down year-over-year and flattish sequentially. At what point would you this expect this business to revert to growth, is that sort of in the second half of '18 given lower comps or do we need to wait longer for this business to start growing again?","Dave Pahl","Yeah so I won't try to predict what the back half of the growth for comms equipment will look like. As you mentioned and you have been following the industry long enough you know that factor is just choppy the way that operators place orders and the OEMs have to build inventories to respond to that. That doesn't make it a bad business. It is just the nature of it and there will be more communications equipment shift in the coming years. So we have got a great position today in 4G products. We will have a great position in 5G products and really any time trying to figure out when that mix will begin to shift and we will just enjoy the demand as it comes in. All right we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question will come from with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","Why don't you just talk about what you're seeing, you mentioned channel inventory. If you can speak to your customer's inventory a little bit and I guess we've seen shortages of things outside of your space like passives and embedded memory and things like that. Is that causing any change to your customer's inventory behavior in your business either because they have inventory waiting for those things are in shortage or are they holding more of a buffer or is it sort of business as usual?","Dave Pahl","I would say that we got no indications of inventories growing or double orders for that matter, which history suggests also and very quickly pointing out that you never really see that ahead of time. So I think with that said I think it is always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility in the distribution inventories that I talked about earlier, good portion of that remains on consignment. So we will actually hold the inventory on our books. Our visibility in the customer inventories varies -- really it depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs we are carrying that inventory, on our books. And we are not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals things like expedites and things like that would suggest that there would be some other broader issue.","Now our visibility inventory beyond our customer's manufacturing operations of course is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hot spots, we work aggressively with customers to close and other metrics like cancellations, reschedules those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time we will just try to keep doing what we have been doing which is with our manufacturing and internal inventory strategies we just stay focused on keeping those lead times stable. And more importantly delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it. You have follow on Joe?","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Danley with Citigroup.","Chris Danley","First question just a quick one. So sequentially revenue increased the gross margins were down a bit, can you comment on why that happened?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, when you look at gross margin fall through which kind of was embedding your question there, in any one sequential transition particularly when revenue was about flat is up 1% is difficult to do that analysis and make -- have anything meaningful come out of that. You probably want to look at it on a year-on-year basis and on that basis our gross margin, gross profit margin increased 160 basis points the fall through was about 78%. And that's along the lines of what we have guided all of you before that on a long-term basis that falls through that you should expect from our revenue gross should be between 70% to 75%.","Chris Danley","Yes, so my follow-up. You never said but the tax rate continues to go down. Can you just talk about your plans for this extra cash? Is it possible I know you usually raise the dividend sometime around August or September? Is it possible or feasible you could raise the dividend twice this year? Why not crank up the buyback a little bit more, I think you took your share count down by just a couple of million around that?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint our objective to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact on a trailing 12 month basis we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow and we have returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we are doing that. Now obviously we do that in two ways, dividends or repurchases. From a dividend standpoint we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis for the previous five years, and at the end of last year also on a trailing 12 month basis that's 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores the sustainability.","On the repurchases, we just got done repurchasing $873 million of our own stock and our objective there is accretive capture of the future free cash for the long-term owners of the company. So we just resell our assumptions to extrapolate estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be and then based on that we come up with different scenarios and valuation as well as the market prices below those scenarios, we buy back the stock and that's what you have seen us do for a numbers of years now and we will continue doing that.","Dave Pahl","Okay thank you. Chris, we will go to our next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Actually maybe I could just follow-up on the last question on gross margin, made on guide specifically in for June but just kind of similar question. Sequential growth in the June, what's the way to think about gross margin is there any segment to think about mix wise or such as to why the gross margin will be up?","Rafael Lizardi","I will just tell you of course for, whenever you in fact hear a specific projection on that we give the revenue range and an EPS range. But the bigger picture on that is that; a, we continue to drive revenue growth and that's the biggest contributor to free cash flow growth. And then in addition to that we continue on increasing our loadings on 300 millimeter, which has 40% cost advantage, that's one of our competitive advantages. We're the only Analog company with own 300 millimeter factory. So every time we build an incremental wafer on 300 millimeter we have better fall through on that. We have better free cash flow per share growth. So we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future and even beyond the current capacity of [those taxes].","Blayne Curtis","Just in the March quarter you saw a good strength in embedded and particularly processors wondering if you can just speak about that strength in terms of end market or particular product discussed will be helpful?","Dave Pahl","If you look at embedded overall and processors specifically they have a very high exposure to industrial and automotive. So that growth is really coming from very diverse places. It will -- connected microcontrollers also grew very nicely as well and again that includes our connectivity products there and they are doing quite well and we are encouraged because that growth is coming from diverse places which I think gives us confidence in the long-term ability of that portion of our business to continue to grow.","Okay Thank you. Blayne we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava","Thank you very much Dave, Rafael, I apologize if I had missed it. What were the orders for the quarter?","Dave Pahl","Our orders for the quarter were up about 11% year on year and that put our book to bill about 1.03 and whenever I give a book to bill I always try to remind everyone that we get about 60% of our revenues that go on consignment. So we don't carry backlog, we get orders running up to the quarter they all want -- they have the new revenue [cap-ins]. So always be cautious on both of those numbers. You have a follow on Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes I did and thanks for the color. Geo wise, was there any geos that stood out as stronger, weaker as you went through the quarter? Thank you.","Dave Pahl","So from a geo standpoint we had revenue up in three of the four regions from a year ago. So Asia was up followed by the U.S. and Europe, Japan is down. And a couple of comments, so first, I'll make the comments that that is measured by where we ship the product and not where it's consumed. So usually our regional shipments don't often reflect the broader macro in a particular region. And the second thing then I'll add is from a Japan standpoint we are seeing that companies in Japan are building products in other regions of the world. So as products get designed in Japan they actually may be produced in other regions, so I wouldn't look too much on that as well.","Okay. Thank you Ambrish and we will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We will take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso","Just a question on what you saw as perhaps better and worse in the quarter and it looks like the revenues came in a little better than you had expected? Can you talk about what was the driver of that?","Dave Pahl","Yes, Chris, so revenues came in within our expectations for the quarter. Certainly they are in the upper half of our expectations. And I'd just say that of course that was driven by industrial and automotive. And I just say that strength we saw very, very broadly. So there wasn't one specific thing that we point to. And I think again that highlights one of those competitive advantages of diversity in line with positions. That we can see that kind of strength and it comes through and shows up even on the top line. You have a follow-up?","Chris Caso","I do, thank you. And I guess that we've been in a situation where business conditions have been stable if not pretty good for a while. I know you guys have been doing this a while, whenever the things are good in semis we wonder how long it's going to last. Can you talk about perhaps what we're seeing now? What perhaps is different than what we have seen in past cycles? Are there things that TI is doing differently? Is there things within the industry that are different as compared to last cycles such that things would be more stable now?","Rafael Lizardi","What I'm going to point out for this question is that we are now a much larger company in terms of industrial and automotive. Our percent of revenue is as of the end of last year was 54%. You go back a few years ago, that number was sub 40%. And that provides inherent stability to our revenue because our revenue comes from many, many customers, many, many sectors within industrial and many -- in equipment. Now does that mean that we would be immune from a correction? I think a correction would short-term or in medium term would affect all those sectors but the important point is that longer-term this is the place where we want to be, because this is in both of those end markets automotive and industrial. That's where the company is growing. So, even if there is -- when there is a correction and we go through that the end point down the road 10, 15, 20 years from now still the same which is more and more content in those end markets.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Chris, and we've got time for one more caller operator.","Operator","We will take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hey guys. So just following up on the last question, Rafael if I look at the five and 10 year averages for revenue growth, Q1 has been down low to mid single-digits, Q2 and Q3 have been up high singles and then Q4 has been kind down the most. Given your enhanced exposure to industrial and automotive, do you still think those averages are good guideposts for us as we forecast your business or do you think it's different now?","Dave Pahl","Romit I will take a shot at that. I think that when we look at seasonality, I would remind you that we still have a very nice calculator business that has a strong seasonal pattern with the back to school. So that along with the balance of the semiconductor business in the past has been stronger in the second and third quarters. So as you know for seasonality in general, that makes second and third quarters stronger than the first and fourth quarters. If you look at those sequential changes you will see that you can take an average of them but the lot of the last five or 10 years is a very, very wide range of numbers that are in there. So when we look at it, we just talk about seasonality in those two quarters. Do you have a follow on?","Romit Shah","Yes, thanks for that, just on R&D in the last several years in Q1, R&D has gone up by about 20 million to 25 million, this Q1 R&D was down 1 million. I know that in 2016 R&D grew faster than revenues and then it grew about in line with revenues in 2017. Just given what we've seen so far year-to-date is it reasonable to assume that we might see more R&D leverage this year versus the last couple of years?","Rafael Lizardi","We are pleased that we're allocating capital to R&D, even SG&A and CapEx and ultimately to drive a top line growth in market share. We do that based on long-term expectations on growth particularly industrial and automotive as I talked about earlier given how well our portfolio matches those markets. So we will continue to do that. And if we have opportunities to increase R&D because we have even better opportunities we will do that, if not we will keep it about where it is but we don't have any said percent increase or number to give you.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you Romit and with that we will wrap up the call. Thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20002":["Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Dave Pahl - Vice President, Head of Investor Relations","Rafael Lizardi - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Finance & Operations","Conference Call Participants","Vivek Arya - Bank of America","Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Timothy Arcuri - UBS","CJ Muse - Evercore","Tore Svanberg - Stifel","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments' 3Q 2019 earnings release conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I will be covering the following topics: First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the third quarter. Second, given the additional weakness we have seen, I will provide some comments about what we are seeing with added insight by segment and end market. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which will open the call for Q&A","Starting with a high-level summary of our third quarter financial results. Revenue decreased 11% from a year ago and came in below the midpoint of our guidance as we saw most end markets continued to weaken further. In our core businesses, analog revenue declined 8% and embedded processing revenue declined 19% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both business' year-on-year year growth decelerated. Earnings per share were $1.49, including a $0.09 benefit for items not in our original guidance due to discrete tax benefits.","With that backdrop, I will now provide details on our performance. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $6 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 41% of revenue.","We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or if it's returned to owners. For the trailing 12-months period, we returned $7.4 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in the business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.","Moving on, I will now provide some details on the third quarter by segment and end market. For the year ago quarter, analog revenue declined 8% due to declines in power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded processing revenue declined 19% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers. All markets declined across embedded, but the declines were most pronounced in the automotive and communications equipment markets. Other declined by 19% from the year ago quarter due to DLP and custom ASICs.","Next, I will provide some comments on what we are seeing in the market and insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. As we said, when you look at 30 years of history, semiconductor cycles can vary widely but typically experienced four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before returning to positive growth. We have also said that the current trade tensions could impact the depth and duration of the cycle. We have provided these comments as contexts not as a prediction about the current cycle.","With the end of this current quarter, we have now experienced our fourth consecutive quarter of negative year-on-year growth. There is an increasing number of reports of macroeconomic weakness with trade tensions as the primary contributor. Consistent with this, the weakness we have seen in the third quarter was broad-based across all markets and most sectors.","Industrial, automotive and personal electronics, all declined upper single digits from the year ago as almost all 28 sectors within these markets declined. In communications equipment, revenue declined about 35% from the year ago and 20% sequentially. We saw weakness across all major customers, regions and technologies. And lastly, enterprise systems declined from the year ago quarter.","We have learned over the years that staying focused on building the company stronger, especially in the face of a weak market provides great long term rewards. We continue to invest in and leverage our competitive advantages. The breadth of our product portfolio and channels to market including our direct sales and applications team as well as TI.com provides us the broadest reach to your customer base, a unique advantage.","We have been evolving our distribution network over the years and continue to do so today as we build stronger direct relationships with our customers. We remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products. We remain focused on industrial and automotive, the best market. They will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and the outlook.","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $778 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue.","Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long term.","Acquisition charges and non-cash expense were $79 million. Acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and will remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021.","Operating profit was $1.59 billion or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 46%, down from 50% a year ago and for embedded processing was 32%, down from 35% a year ago. Despite current weakness, our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.","Other income and expense was a $34 million benefit, up $11 million from a year ago. Net income in the third quarter was $1.43 billion or $1.49 per share, which included a $0.09 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-months basis was $6.03 billion.","In September, we announced we would increase our quarterly dividend by 17%, marking our 16th year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $721 million in dividends and repurchased $456 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.18 billion. In total, we have returned $7.38 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 48% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.07 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $750 million of debt and issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 2.25% due in 10 years. This results in total debt of $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%.","Inventory days were 139, up eight days from a year ago and down four days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs. Work in both of these areas is mostly complete. Given the weaker environment, we have reduced wafer starts to align with demand.","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $1.09, which includes an estimated $5 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019, As a reminder, acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021.","In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. The first one is on the Q4 outlook. How do we get confidence that this isn't company specific or share loss, because when we looked at some of the SIA data for July and August, it was more positive. So is it anything that is company specific in Q4, because the guidance is substantially below? We understand the macro environment is not that great. But is there anything one-off company specific that is impacting your guidance? Is there any share loss issue? Any other color that you could provide would be very helpful.","Dave Pahl","Yes. Vivek, I will take that. I would say, state the obvious, obviously the SIA numbers are more backward-looking versus the looking into fourth quarter. And I think when you judge share and we have talked about this in past, but you really need to judge it over multiple quarters. You look at the diversity of our revenue. We talk about one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity. Our biggest the product last year, as an example, was about 0.8% of our total revenue. So just that diversity, I think, has served us well and will continue to serve us well.","Do you have a follow-on?","Vivek Arya","Yes. Thanks Dave. Somewhat more longer term, there is a lot of discussion of parallel technology in semis ecosystem developing in China as it tries to get more self-sufficient. How well is TI placed from a competitive perspective? Do you think there are substitutes for your kind of analog and embedded products from Chinese vendors over some intermediate timeframe? And what would TI need to do different as a company to react to this new ecosystem?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I will start off. I think if you look at the analog and the embedded market, they have got many natural competitive moats that sit around the marketplace overall. I think that we have certainly heard discussions of Chinese customers wanting to ensure that they have alternatives. But it's very different than being designed out. So our customers overall are very pragmatic. They are looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost and the most dependable delivery. So I think we will continue to focus on those things. And they have served us well in the past and we believe it will continue to serve us well in the future.","Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow-up on a little bit around Q4. We have been in this environment for a while. I think you had your first guide for cut actually on this call a year ago. But even on that call, you had guided Q4 2018 down about 12% sequentially which was obviously below. We are a later. We have had a number of rounds of cuts. So the base is even lower and now you are guiding Q4 2019 down by 50% sequentially. So it's even worse on a sequential basis than we saw in the year ago quarter when we started. I guess it's and again it's not like things have been weak all along. I guess if you can give us some kind of an indication, maybe what could get immediately worse? Is this your Huawei pull-forward working off? Is this something going on because your distribution strategy is different from your competitors? I guess anything you can give us around the tactical near term environment driving the Q4 guide would be helpful, just given what we have seen over the last year or so in those trends?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. Let me take a shot at that. And then Dave will follow-up with other comments. But our sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago. And many of them, when talk about the caution, they mentioned the trade tensions that we know have been happening and have been accumulating over the last three or four quarters. And the consistency of that breadth of weakness supports that this is a macro situation that is driving the further weakness that we are seeing.","Dave Pahl","You have got a follow-on?","Stacy Rasgon","I do. So you have talk about evolving your distribution strategy and relationships. Do you think it's possible that any of those activities as you disintermediate more of them maybe having like a near term negative impact on your revenue outlook because you can rely on them less to do things like demand generation and the like? Is there, I guess, any change you have made recently you think could be having any sort of impact on the near term horizon?","Dave Pahl","Yes. Simply in a word, I would just say, no, Stacy. I think establishing a more direct relationship with our customer just yields more rewards than it does the risk. And it gives us greater access to those customers. And you have seen us evolve that over the last several years and we have made investments in order to provide very high levels of service for our customers, especially as we move to a more direct business model. And these investments include the things that you have heard us talk about, the new capabilities and in some cases improved capabilities to our website, e-commerce enhancements for demand creation, inventory consignment programs that we have talked about on the last the last few calls and other things like order fulfillment services. So these improved capabilities combined with our sales and applications organization which by the way is the largest in the semiconductor industry just help us provide great product and great support to our customers. And that's really what we have been focused on.","Thank you. And we will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer","Yes. Thank guys. Thanks for letting me ask questions. Dave, I just want to go back to the embedded. When I look at how your analog business trending, it's about in line with our expectations and quite frankly, what your peer group is doing. But when I look at embedded, it seems to be demonstrably worse. In fact, if Q4 is down sequentially equally across all segments, you will be down peak to trough this cycle in embedded, more so than you were in the 2009 financial crisis when financial markets weren't working properly and companies couldn't actually get funding for inventory. So I just want to kind of go back and kind of understand why you think the embedded business is doing so poorly relative to overall kind of industry trends? Is that really where the comms weakness comes in? If you can help me understand that a little bit better, it would be helpful.","Dave Pahl","Yes. And John, to put it in context, we talked about at the company level, so including analog and embedded that all the markets were week, that when we saw the sectors that make up those markets that most of them were weak. But that weakness was just more pronounced directionally the same but just more pronounced in embedded. And you know, we did see and if you look now just inside of embedded, we saw a more pronounced weakness in automotive and in communications. So again, I think that those types of things need to be measured over longer periods of time. And so I wouldn't judge that business on any one quarter results overall.","You have a follow-on, John?","John Pitzer","Yes. Just as a follow-up, just going back to the comms part of the business. So I am just kind of curious, not that the macro is all that strong, but to what extent can you quantify, if at all, the impact from bans? Is this way Huawei having ordered a lot more inventory throughout the year than you thought? Is this a certain company or region? Just on the comms side, any color you can give on the weakness would be helpful.","Dave Pahl","Yes. I think we can't rule out, obviously, you know customers having built inventory in preparations for builds or concerns with the trade tensions. But the weakness that we saw wasn't limited to any region. That was very broad-based. When we look at the largest customers inside of comms equipment, that was across the largest customers. And again, we talked about that it was across the technologies. So it's really broad-based, the weakness. So not just one customer or not just one technology or not just one region. So hopefully that color helps.","Thank you, John. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ross Seymore","Dave, you gave the year-over-year comments and then the sequentials for the comm equipment. But I think we are all trying to solve the main problem of kind of why is your guidance so weak in the fourth quarter? To the extent it provides any clues, could you give us what the quarter-over-quarter sequentials were by the end markets outside of the comm, which you already gave?","Dave Pahl","Sure. Industrial and automotive declined low single digits, Ross. Personal electronics grew midteens and that was based on really just seasonal growth that we would expect to see. We already commented on comms equipment declining about 20%. And then enterprise systems grew in the quarter.","You have a follow-on?","Ross Seymore","Yes. I guess one on the cash return side of things. I know one quarter doesn't necessarily make a trend, but you guys have been ridiculously consistent in a positive way with your buyback over time. I know you raised the dividend this last quarter. But I think the share repurchase was the lowest since I believe the second quarter of 2012, if my model is right. And the aggregate of the two, the dividend and the buyback, were meaningfully less than the free cash flow in the quarter. I know it's not just one quarter, but is there anything at that explains why the buyback was significantly lower than it's been in any time in recent history?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. I would tell you and that is I will take you back to our capital management strategy and our objectives to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And as you pointed out, we do that through buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis which is a better way to look at all these things, to give you just a better trend of what's going on, we have returned $7.4 billion of cash and our free cash flow has been $6 billion during that time. So we have returned 122% of free cash during that time. So a pretty healthy amount. And in the last quarter, we returned or we bought back $456 million. As long as the stock price is below our assessment of intrinsic, we will be buying back shares and we did buy a healthy amount in third quarter.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. And I will just add to that, that as Rafael said, it's quite best to look at the free cash flow metrics on a trailing 12-month basis, as there is seasonality. Third and fourth quarter tend to be stronger than first and second on that. So that usually provides a better insight.","Thank you Ross. And we will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joe Moore","Yes. I wonder if you could give us more color, I mean you have talked about your customers being more cautious. But to what degree do you think that's demand being softer that's different inventory behavior? And I guess on the flipside, I mean it doesn't seem like you are seeing a lot of inventory accumulation around the tariff activities. But just could you just generally comment on the state of your customers' inventories as you move to the last quarter? Thanks.","Dave Pahl","Yes. Joe, I will make a comment and if Rafael wants to add something to it, certainly jump in, Rafael. But you know, when we look at inventory in the channel, it was actually down a little bit sequentially, still at about four-and-a-half weeks. So really not changing much overall. We still have about two-thirds of our revenue supported by consignment overall. So we know that inventory remains at zero because of those consignment programs. So they continue to be in a healthy state. The rest of that, we can't see into our customers' inventories and down channel. So our visibility really ends at that point.","Rafael?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. The only thing I would add, I can sense that you collectively are unsatisfied with our answers and I understand that. We have close to 100,000 different customers and we sell about 100,000 different products. It's difficult to pinpoint any one thing. But the sense we get talking to those customers, getting input from them, from our salespeople and all the touch points that we have is that the weakness is broad-based, is due to macro events and specifically the trade tensions.","And if you think about when there is tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious and they pull back. And we are at the very end of our long supply chain and when the ones at the very front pullback, it becomes a traffic jam. So our sense is that is what's happening in the marketplace. But we will see what other companies will report over time and we will get a clear picture over the next several weeks and really quarters, because this thing we have been in it for now four quarters and it's going to be longer than that.","Dave Pahl","You have a follow-on, Joe?","Joe Moore","Yes. And thanks for the color. I do appreciate you guys clarifying what's going on. In terms of the wafer start reduction in the fourth quarter, can you just talk about, I guess normally you have talked about a 70% incremental gross margin in both directions, anything kind of different as you think about Q4 because of the fact of that wafer start comment that you made?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. Actually, no, not any different to the larger degree. We have talked about 70% to 75% fall through. And that's a guide. It could be a little less, a little more. So that's probably how you want to think about it on a year-on-year basis for fourth quarter. We did lower wafer starts in third quarter inside of the quarter and we are lowering those further into fourth quarter. And that's a capital allocation decision. When we do that we save cash, right. And we have, to a larger degree, built the buffer strategy that we have talked about. So we will save cash as we do that and that makes sense for the owners of the company. There is cash that's freed up for other purposes. That will hit the GPM line, but it will do so about as expected. So as I say, you have seen a fall through that we have talked about in the big scheme of things.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you Joe. We will go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri","Hi. Thanks. Q4 OpEx is usually down low to mid singles. I am just trying to see if that's the right number for December that's in the guidance?","Dave Pahl","OpEx, well, first remember, the objective of OpEx is to fuel our long term growth and these are long term investments that pay off over many, many years, in many cases decades. So that's how we think about. In this environment, we are cautious and we want to be prudent. But we are not cutting back on those long term investments.","On a trailing 12-month basis, OpEx has been running pretty steady at about $3.2 billion for at least a year or so, if you look at trailing 12-month at the end of every quarter for the last three or four quarters. And it is overall is down about 1% versus a year ago. But of course, revenue has been dropping more than that. So then, as a percent of revenue, it's gone up a little bit. So now it's at 20%. And that's well within our expectation, our guide of 20% to 25% for that metric.","You have a follow up?","Timothy Arcuri","Sure. I guess with respect to the loadings commentary, does it make you rethink the timing on the new 300 millimeter fab, if you can give us an update there? Thanks.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. Sure. So first, let me remind you, of course when it comes to CapEx, particularly for that fab, it's all about driving long term revenue growth and extending our manufacturing advantage, including 300 millimeter. And that is one of our key competitive advantages. We are now in the process of building a parking structure that will be complete in the first half of next year. Once we build that, that will enable us to build the building for the next 300 millimeter factory. Our plan continues to be to build that building within the next few years.","And as a reminder, that will cost $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years as we build that building. And $600 million to $700 million, it is a sizable amount. But the big expense comes from the equipment that would follow. And in fact an even bigger one will be the opportunity cost of not having that available, if there s, or when there is growth on the other side of these things. So we think about all of those things and based on that we have laid our plans at the moment.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you Tim. We can go to our next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from CJ Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead.","CJ Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to revisit comments around China and the potential for pull-ins. If I look back at your June quarter, that business was up about 6% year-on-year where everything else was down 1%. And so I guess as you look back and you think forward, do you have a sense that was in fact pull-ins in the prior quarters and that's perhaps exacerbating what you are seeing into the December quarter?","Dave Pahl","Yes. I think that, so first I spent eight years of my career in sales and I like the job. I never once took a double order or saw a customer do a pull-in, right. But so certainly wouldn't rule that out as a possibility. But I think more of what you are seeing there is just seasonality as customers prepare more of the PE products, our products are shipped into China than any other region. So that has an effect that's in there as well. So again, I won't rule it out. But you have got some seasonality that's going on with that.","You have a follow-on?","CJ Muse","I do. You talked broad based weakness. But I was hoping perhaps you could narrow in on auto and give a little more color on what you are seeing there, either geographically or by sub-segment?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So we have got five sectors that are inside of that. All the sectors saw weakness. I made the comment that if you look at the sectors across industrial and even personal electronics, that most of those sectors were down. So automotive was no different from that front. And I would say that from a regional standpoint, we saw weakness across all of the regions. So nothing really significant there to spike out.","Okay. Thank you CJ. And with that, we have got time for one last caller. Operator?","Operator","Our last question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the linearity of the orders? So obviously there's been some weakening. And I am just wondering if you already started to see that this summer? Or was it sort of something more that came later in the quarter?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So I would say that it was weak throughout the quarter. It wasn't last couple of week or last 30-day phenomenon. I would also point out we have got two-thirds of our revenue on consignment. So in those arrangements, we get the order and ship them instantaneously at the same time. So revenues and orders really reflect each other for the most part.","Do you have follow-on, Tore?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. I had a follow-on for Rafael. So you have done a tremendous job on gross margin. Revenues down 12% year-over-year but gross margin only down 90 basis points. And now your inventory days were down as well sequentially. I know you talked a little bit about the factory loadings in Q4. But should we think about some sort of a inventory days target that you want to run the business at next few quarters?","Rafael Lizardi","So good question. Let me first step back and remind you how we think about inventory, okay. Inventory, the objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence and improve our asset utilization. We have a guide of 115 to 145, but those are not concrete barriers, right. It's just a guide there. We are going to do the right thing for the business.","So for example, in this situation, in the current environment, even though we have decreased those wafer starts, it is likely that we go above the top of that range or it's at least possible that we do just because of where the revenue midpoint is. Now we are not going to go drive the wafer starts in a draconian way to just to stay within those guidelines.","That would not make sense in one quarter. But over one, two, three quarters then the idea is to, that guidelines just provide an area where we should aim at and we can achieve our objectives, the inventory objectives I talked about, while deploying and allocating capital in the best way that benefits the interest of the long term owners of the company.","Dave Pahl","So with that, let me just finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. We will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. Lastly, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term. It's why we will maximize value for the owners of the company.","Rafael Lizardi","Thank you all for joining us.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Slaymaker","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.","Business in the quarter strengthened steadily. You will recall that in our mid-quarter update, we narrowed revenue to the upper half of the original range we set in January. In the end, we finished just below the top of our range. This is a healthy environment, where customers are maintaining lean inventory levels and are relying on TI's short product lead times, well-positioned inventory and strong manufacturing capacity to give them what they want when they want it.","As our revenue built in the quarter, it fell through nicely to profit. EPS of $0.32 was at the top of our range of expectations. As we review our first quarterly report for 2013, I believe it is important to note that TI is now a company firmly rooted in Analog and Embedded Processing. These 2 areas made up 77% of our revenue in the quarter, a full 500 basis points more than a year ago. This makes us less dependent on any one customer and on any one end market. As we've noted previously, our largest customer is now in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our total revenue.","As more of our revenue comes from Analog and Embedded Processing, our market exposure has also expanded favorably. Today, 35% of our revenue comes from the industrial and automotive markets, more than from the communications market and more than from the computing market. Each of these markets is important, and with more balance in the mix of revenue from each, we expect steadier growth and better returns.","The strength of our business model gives us confidence that we can sustainably generate $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue, and then return all of it to shareholders except what is required to repay debt. You saw that confidence exhibited in the first quarter, as we raised our dividend by 33% to $1.12 per share annualized and added another $5 billion of share repurchase authorization.","In considering our performance and valuation, we believe it is important to pay attention to cash flow from operations and especially to the free cash flow we're generating, in addition to our income statement and balance sheet. We think free cash flow is important for a couple of reasons. First, over the past few years, net income has lagged the amount of free cash that TI generates, and we expect this to continue for a number of years. In fact, free cash flow was more than net income in 4 of the past 5 years. In 2012 alone, free cash flow exceeded net income by $1.16 billion.","So why does free cash flow exceed net income and why will this continue? Two primary factors are the amortization of acquisition intangibles associated with National, which will run about $320 million per year for the next 6 years. Also, depreciation expense exceeds our capital expenditure needs, thanks to the strong capacity position we currently have installed and the long life of our manufacturing equipment for Analog and Embedded Processing.","In 2012, depreciation exceeded CapEx by $462 million, and our guidance reflects about a $400 million difference in 2013. We expect it will be several more years before this gap closes, considering that our capital expenditures should remain at low levels.","The second reason we believe free cash flow is important is that cash returns are an important element of shareholders returns. The more free cash we can generate, the more cash we intend to return to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is an important benefit to our long-term investors.","The end result is that free cash flow, when considered on a trailing 12-month basis, is an important metric for our investors to assess the value of the enterprise and one that determines how much cash we can return to them. Of course, in the short term, any quarterly metric can vary significantly with seasonality and other factors. This is often noise and may not correlate with long-term changes in the intrinsic value of the company.","Let me now walk through the quarter's results. I'll note that this is our first financial report based on our updated segment reporting structure. Please see our earnings release for a description of these changes. We have also provided historical information for the new segments on the IR page of our website.","Revenue of $2.89 billion declined 8% from a year ago and 3% sequentially. The largest part of the decline in both comparisons was from our legacy wireless products. Analog revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was about even sequentially. From a year ago, Silicon Valley Analog had the largest decline, mostly reflecting its ongoing conversion to a consignment inventory program with our distributors. Sequentially, growth was greatest in Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog, 2 product lines with strong exposure to the industrial market. Growth in these areas was offset by lower revenue in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. Silicon Valley Analog's rate of conversion to consignment at distribution was about the same this quarter as last, but this was not a significant factor in the sequential growth rate.","Embedded Processing increased 4% from a year ago and 3% sequentially, with growth in microcontrollers the biggest factor in both comparisons. Our Other segment revenue declined 24% from a year ago and 12% sequentially. In both comparisons, legacy wireless products were the biggest factor in the decline. Revenue from these products was $200 million -- $210 million in the first quarter compared with $339 million a year ago and $270 million in the fourth quarter. We expect this revenue to decline throughout 2013 and essentially be gone by the end of this year. Also, in comparing the Other segment's revenue with the year ago, please note that quarter included about $65 million in business interruption insurance proceeds associated with the earthquake in Japan.","Turning to distribution, resales [ph]  grew 1% from a year ago and declined 3% from the prior quarter. Distributors were able to further reduce their inventory levels as they continued to rely more heavily upon our consignment program. Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.","Kevin P. March","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit of $1.37 million was 47.6% of revenue, down 10% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. The decline from a year ago was mostly due to lower revenue. The included -- this included business interruption insurance proceeds in the year-ago quarter that fell through strongly to gross profit in that quarter. Sequentially, lower gross profit mostly reflected lower revenue.","Operating expenses of $878 million were 10% lower than a year ago, mostly due to cost reductions associated with our legacy wireless product lines, as well as synergies associated with our National acquisition. Sequentially, operating expenses increased 3%, which was mostly tied to seasonal factors such as compensation-related expenses that were primarily offset by savings associated with our Wireless restructuring.","Net income in the first quarter was $362 million or $0.32 per share, and includes a $65 million discrete tax benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, which was retroactive to the beginning of 2012. We had previously described this credit as part of our guidance for the quarter.","I'll point out that, as we have eliminated our Wireless segment, a higher portion of the expenses associated with our corporate activities are being allocated to the remaining segments. We are fully on track to achieve the cost reductions that we described in November with our Wireless restructuring actions, and these gains can be readily observed at the company level. However, profitability in the other segments has been impacted as they now shoulder more of the allocated expense. You will see this in both the comparisons with the year-ago quarter as well as the prior quarter.","Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $360 million in the quarter. We lowered our inventory by $57 million in the quarter. Inventory days declined to 101 days from 103 days last quarter. We're a little below our long-term targeted range of 105 to 115 days that we communicated in February. However, inventory days will likely rise for the remainder of this year as the Wireless revenue and its associated inventory, which turns at a faster pace, winds down. Capital expenditures were $84 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $276 million.","Given the noise that is inherent in quarterly cash flow and its components, it is useful to look at this on a trailing 12-month basis to understand our longer-term trends and progress. On this basis, cash flow from operations was $3.32 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $476 million, down 34% from a year ago. And free cash flow was more than $2.85 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 23% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. In the year-ago quarter, trailing 12-month period free cash flow was 18% of revenue.","I should note that our capital expenditures for the past 12 months were 4% of revenue. We are operating at the low end of our model, and we believe we can remain at this low level of spending for several years, given our strong capacity position that has been built as a result of our strategic investments of the past few years. The cash flow that will result as we fill up this capacity should be strong in the years ahead.","And as we said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide strong cash returns to our shareholders. In the first quarter, TI paid $232 million in dividends and repurchased $679 million of our stock. For the past 12 months, we have paid $856 million in dividends or 30% of our free cash flow. Similarly, we have repurchased $2.18 billion of our stock or 77% of free cash flow. In total, we've returned 107% of free cash flow over the past 12 months.","As we explained in February, our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what is needed to repay debt. Fundamental to this strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.86 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 84% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. This means our assets are productive, and our cash, because it is largely onshore, is readily available by the corporation for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.","TI orders grew sequentially, and our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 as our backlog expanded. Customers continue to keep the amount of backlog they have in our books constrained, however. Demand has been rising but we've been executing well to support it, despite not having a lot of extended visibility.","Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.93 billion to $3.17 billion in the second quarter. And at the middle of this range, revenue would increase about 6% sequentially, despite about a 30% expected decline in revenue from our legacy wireless products. As for the rest of our revenue, that would result in growth of about 8.5%, at the middle of our range, a level that is generally consistent with the seasonal average for our second quarter.","We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.45. For the year, our estimated -- for R&D expense has been reduced to $1.5 billion, down from our prior estimate of $1.6 billion and compared with $1.9 billion in 2012. Most of the reductions from 2012 are a result of our Wireless restructuring activity. Our estimate for capital expenditures remains $500 million, well below our depreciation estimate of $900 million. Our estimated effective tax rate remains at 22%.","So in summary, we continue to be encouraged by our strategic progress. TI is now clearly an Analog and Embedded Processing company. We serve a diverse set of customers and end markets, which means we have the opportunity for long-term sustainable growth with less volatility than in our past. The small amount of legacy wireless revenue that remains is quickly winding down. The combination of our rich product portfolio and ample manufacturing capacity has us well positioned for growth in the years ahead. And that growth should continue to drive good cash generation, $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue, and we fully intend to continue to return this to you, our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.","Ron Slaymaker","Thanks, Kevin. Amber, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Kevin, I guess for you. As we think about the allocation of OpEx to the Analog and Embedded business as you're moving away from Wireless, one, is it sort of going along as you thought it would in Q1? And what's the pattern we should expect to see in terms of Analog and Embedded profitability as we go through the rest of year?","Kevin P. March","Glen, the allocation that you're talking about is the -- I think you're talking about the allocation of the corporate expenses.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right.","Kevin P. March","And again, just to repeat what I've mentioned a moment ago, because we now have less cost going forward, that corporate cost will allocate to fewer segments. But the burden by those remaining segments will be up. The cost of the corporate activities doesn't scale one for one with the cost of the actual business operations. And consequently, while that will come down a little bit, it won't come down near to the magnitude that the inherent cost will come down as we wind down the Wireless segment. But the result of the allocated cost to remaining segments will be higher. And you can see that incrementally, if you look at the segments that we just published. And on a go-forward basis, those allocated costs will come down a little bit over time, but not significantly. The result is though, as we see revenue growth going on inside the segment, we should see the profitably of the segments continue to improve.","Ron Slaymaker","But as Wireless winds down from here, Kevin, will those allocated costs increase further to Analog and Embedded or are they basically at the run rate for the year?","Kevin P. March","They're pretty close to the run rate for the year that they're going to be at.","Ron Slaymaker","All right. Glen, do you have a follow-on?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I do. We've had some of your peers talk about growth in the June quarter and basically suggest things are growing, but maybe not growing at a stellar rate. I wonder if you can talk about your order linearity in the quarter, how you -- how that progressed, and maybe your view on sort of the steepness or shallowness, as it were, of the cycle that we're in.","Ron Slaymaker","Glen, I guess -- I'm afraid I don't have a lot further to add than what's inherent in the guidance. So, other than the decline in legacy wireless, we're expecting a seasonal second quarter for the remainder of our revenue. The microanalysis of the quarter and linearity of revenue or linearity of orders, frankly, there's nothing really to be gained there. And what I mean by that is we had a typical first quarter profile on both orders and revenue. We declined around Chinese New Year as we do every year and then it's recovered and bounced back again in the month of March. But nothing really unique in the first quarter profile compared with what we would typically expect in a first quarter. Okay, Glen, thanks for your questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What are you guys planning on doing with the factory loadings in Q2 and any thoughts on the factory loadings at this point for the back half?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Jim, as it relates to loadings, with the increased outlook that we have, we would expect the factory loadings to be higher in 2Q than they were in 1Q. And consequently, utilization charges will, in all likelihood, decline quarter-over-quarter. I expect that the utilization, which was about $150 million of underutilization charge in the first quarter, which was down about $20 million from the fourth quarter, will decline further as we go into second quarter on the back of increased factory loadings.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on question, Jim?","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And I know you guys have kind of taken to using the trend line analysis to think about the industry and underscore that, even though we don't know exactly when things are going to recover, it's just a way to highlight how much we're undershipping sort of what a long-term level is. I think the kind of conventional bear case on that is a, long-term demand is broken now, and that trend line, that a lot of us using, including you guys, isn't relevant anymore. So what do you say to folks when they say that long-term trend line is broken and therefore, that analysis isn't relevant?","Ron Slaymaker","Jim, recently -- we're trying to avoid that discussion. And what I mean by that is we have no unique insight to provide in terms of where we are with respect to that trend line, where we are with respect to the cycle. And so frankly, we're just heads down focusing on trying to gain share in Analog and Embedded Processing regardless of the market environment, and be able to generate free cash flow at the 20% to 25% of revenue level that we described. But we'll leave it to you experts to try to figure out where we are relative to those trends and relative to any cycle considerations.","Okay, Jim, thank you for your questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Danely, JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is just on -- another one on order trends. So it seems like after this quarter, the Wireless part of your baseband [ph]  probably be pretty much de minimis. So if we just continue in the sort of normal seasonal slog, can you just remind us what Q3 normal seasonality is? And will there be or could there be any more depression on your overall sales from Wireless in Q3?","Ron Slaymaker","I think -- well, Chris, I mean, we're saying so in second quarter. We're saying that the Wireless, legacy Wireless, will decline to roughly about $150 million compared with $210 million in first quarter. So there's still $150 million to unwind through the remainder of the year. So the answer is yes, it will likely continue to be a bit of a headwind, but I think we've quantified it. It gets smaller and smaller as every quarter passes by, which means the end is near on that. In terms of third quarter, our historical average is about 5%, and again, I'll put the same caveat on it we always do, there's a wide range about that 5-year average. In our case, it's minus 2% to plus 18% so -- but the average is, in fact, 5%. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. Can you just give us your expectations on the relative growth rates for either your main product lines or end markets for the rest of the year? Or at least give us the status of those?","Kevin P. March","Chris, I would just say that we would expect that, at least for our segments, we're likely to grow at least at the market rate. And because we have been pretty successful at consistently gaining market share for the last 4 or 5 years in each of our target segments of Analog and Embedded Processing, I would expect that we should be able to turn in maybe growth a little bit beyond what the total market itself grows. Beyond that, as Ron mentioned a moment ago, we're probably a little bit hesitant to go off and articulate that we had some kind of expertise or special insight as to the market growth or the economy as a whole. Instead, we remain focused on really growing share and converting that revenue growth into free cash flow. We've targeted 20% to 25%. We just turned in 23% for the last 12 months, and that was in a pretty weak market. So with that in mind, we're pretty encouraged as to what this portfolio can do for our shareholders going forward.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, Chris, thank you for questions.","Operator","We'll go next to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Kevin, as that Wireless legacy business goes to 0, what would you expect the profitably to be in the other bucket? Is the intent to try to get that to breakeven as revenue goes away, or how should I think about that?","Kevin P. March","John, I would think that, that would be profitable. Because as that Wireless goes to 0, on its way down, it's probably delivering pretty much no profit, because we're taking out cost at about the same rate that the gross profit dollars are coming out. But keep in mind, what else is in there. We have our DLP technologies in there, we have our custom ASIC in there, we have our calculator business in there and we have our royalties in there. And each of those are relatively low R&D, relatively low SG&A type of businesses, so they generate reasonably high margins and attractive cash. So the only thing that will be dragging it down on a go-forward basis, recall that we also take -- we put the acquisition-related charges into that segment, which will run around $85 million a quarter. And we also put restructuring charges into that segment, which this past quarter was about $13 million, and should run about that same level for the next couple of quarters.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, John?","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, quickly as a follow-on, just 2 housekeeping. Did you give an absolute bookings number? And you spent about $680 million buying back stock in the quarter, but share count was kind of flat sequentially. Can you just help me understand, was that just stock price driving more options in the money and dilution, or was there something else going on?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. John, on the bookings, orders were $2.96 billion in the quarter. That was up 9% sequentially and that resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of -- Kevin already said it was positive, but it was 1.03, and that compares to 0.91 in the fourth quarter. Let me add an additional note maybe or asterisk to the book-to-bill. Keep in mind that we now have 45% of our total revenue on consignment. So consignment, by definition, runs a 1.0 book-to-bill. So for the additional 55% of our revenue that's not on consignment, for the total to net out to 1.03, obviously the non-consignment revenue ran well above that 1.03 book-to-bill. So obviously, we have a book-to-bill that's fully supportive of the revenue we have forecast for the next quarter. Kevin, you want to handle the back part of the question?","Kevin P. March","Yes, John, on the question of the stock count relatively flat this quarter, and in the face of the fact that we've repurchased $679 million worth of shares, there are really 2 things going on there. With the increase in stock price and just the natural pending expiration of certain stock options, there was an increase in stock option exercise across the employee base and that, of course, put shares back into the market. At the same time, that stock price increased the dilutive share count. So those 2 elements combined basically held the share count about even in the first quarter.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, John, thanks for your questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Had a question on the trajectory of OpEx. So your new R&D guide replies something exiting the year at a run rate of maybe $340 million, $350 million. Is that accurate? Can you give us some idea of, I guess, what the trajectory of OpEx through the year looks like, and how sustainable that run rate exiting the year is going to be going forward? Do you expect that to grow as revenues grow?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Stacy, so just to help everybody else get to that similar conclusion there. We guided R&D to $1.5 billion. We just spent about $420 million, $419 million this past quarter. So you can kind of get to what the balance of the quarters look like. I would point out that, on the Wireless restructuring, we mentioned that we're well on our way to the $450 million in annualized savings. And the best way to see that is probably to take a look at TI -- at third quarter and kind of compare that with where we're at today. And you can see the effect on the R&D line as we begin to unwind the Wireless segment. We're probably about halfway through -- more than halfway through the savings and the R&D as it relates to the Wireless restructuring. And so that will keep on going. And so the kind of math that you're using when you get to year end, from a seasonal basis, probably isn't too far off from what we might expect by the time we get there. And clearly, we'll have such things as pay and benefit increases and so on, on a year-over-year basis and we'll bump that back up as we move into 2014, but I don't expect that to be all that much in relation to the total cost savings that we have. A similar phenomenon on SG&A is likely to occur, although not nearly at the same magnitude. Clearly, the biggest spend in the Wireless restructuring was in the R&D cost category.","Ron Slaymaker","Stacy, do you have a follow-on?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I do. I wanted to poke into the Embedded Processing margins a bit. So I get the idea that you're allocating more corporate cost around the -- around the other businesses. In this case, so you also lumped in, I guess, the Wireless Embedded? And I just wanted to clarify, I think your plan is have that business at a roughly breakeven OpEx level right now for the Wireless piece. Can you give us -- number one, is that accurate? If it's not, can you tell us what that, I guess, the OpEx burden of that business looks like? And finally, how big does Embedded Processing actually need to get now before you can start driving margins, I guess, at historical levels in that business? Are we -- are you finished increasing the investment levels there? Do we have all we need?","Kevin P. March","Stacy, I'll go ahead and answer that. And if I miss something, maybe Ron can speak up also. What we talked about was that the Embedded Processing technologies of OMAP and Connectivity, when -- we've operated at about breakeven. Keep in mind that the portion that we move from Wireless will be added to a portion, the OMAP portion, that was already serving the Embedded space, in the form of the automotive markets that was already inside the Embedded Processing segment. So when we look at those and combine those, they are at about breakeven on a combined basis. I won't go into details as to what their OpEx levels are, but just suffice it to say that they're at about breakeven on a combined basis. On a go-forward basis, to your question as to what should we expect from Embedded Processing, I would characterize the level of -- the level of investment inside that segment today to no longer require additions of the level that we've been doing in the past couple of years. We are at a point now where we are spending at sufficient levels to invest in product development. And now, it's all about growing the revenue to begin to absorb the costs that are already inside that segment. So at this point, and as you saw in this past quarter, that segment did grow. And it's grown not only on a quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year basis. And so I would expect that we would continue to see some good things out of that segment.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Thank you, Stacy, for your questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on the trajectory of the OpEx cuts. I mean, should we think about it fairly linear on the R&D side? And then can you just remind us what the target is on the SG&A? You said you thought you could bring it down a little bit, but it -- does it still get back to where your target is?","Kevin P. March","Blayne, I'm not sure what you're talking about on targets per se. I would say that, broadly speaking, we have talked about OpEx, as a collective cost category, to fluctuate between 20% and 30% of our revenues. From where, on a weak cycle, which we're just coming out of right now, we would expect that to be at the upper end of that range, pushing the 30% level. And in fact, in first quarter it was exactly that. It was 30% of our revenues. As our revenue strengthen, we would expect that OpEx to work its way down as a percentage of revenue. And in a strong market, get down to the 20% kind of range. On a go-forward basis, there is still cost to come out, as I mentioned a few moments ago, especially out of the R&D line. Do recall that when we talked about the cost savings that we expected from the Wireless restructuring, $450 million annualized by the end of the year, roughly 75% of that is going to come out of R&D, roughly 15% of that will come out of SG&A and the balance would come out of cost to revenue. So we would expect to see a little bit more lift out of the SG&A as we get later in the year. And largely, this is a timing of the action, certain of our sights around the world that will affect when we see those benefits begin to come through the P&L.","Ron Slaymaker","Right. And I would just add that if you compare where we were in first quarter with R&D compared with third quarter of last year, before we initiated the Wireless restructuring, you'll see that we are well ahead of linearity in terms of the reduction. That being said, probably, linear assumptions from now through the rest of the -- over the next 3 quarters, is probably about the best you could do. The end result likely won't be fully linear, but that's probably about as good as we could get. And I should say we're still -- there is some work we're doing with the Works Council in Europe that could affect the timing of the activity. So there is certainly some uncertainty there just in terms of the exact profile. But we're well on track to achieve the savings, and we'll get the remainder out. Just whether it's linear or sooner or low -- or slower, we'll leave to -- report it as it happens. Do you have a follow-on, Blayne?","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So then just on the drop-through of gross margin in the June guidance, it seems like a little bit below your target. Is that just calculators, or if you can just talk about the different moving pieces on gross margin?","Kevin P. March","Blayne, I'm not sure what you're saying, a little bit below our target. We did talk about that during -- through the course of the cycle, we would expect fall-through -- delta revenue to fall through the GPM would be 75% through the course of the cycle, based upon our historical experience.   In fact, we've got pretty good fall-through happening right now, if you do the math on 1Q revenue we just turned in. And we just said, up on the midpoint of the guidance that we just gave, I think we got some pretty reasonable fall-through on that. And in fact, if you take a look at it, it actually makes quite a bit of sense in the context of 2 things. Really, we've got mix improvements as Wireless is coming out, and so Analog and Embedded Processing become a larger portion of our revenue. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we've got the benefit of the fact that our factory loadings will be up on expectations of higher revenue in second quarter. And so that will have a favorable benefit to our utilization charges.","Ron Slaymaker","So Blayne, just -- I would just -- we don't get down to those individual lines. But in terms of your model, charges in second quarter will probably be pretty similar to where they were in the first quarter. Most of the acquisition charge line is the amortization of acquisitions, and will pretty -- will stay pretty stable for a period of time. The restructuring, as we continue our work to close those 2 older factories, the one in Houston, the one in Hiji, Japan, which will take through probably -- or the second facility will close in second half of that, of this year. So we probably have a couple more quarters where the restructuring charge will be similar to what you saw in first quarter. And so I think if you take that, if you've taken -- if you add to it to the guidance we provided on R&D, you should find your growth -- your incremental margin will be very similar to what we described as the historical level or above. So I think as you continue to scrub that, you'll probably get a refined answer. All right. Blayne, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. I wonder if you can give us -- and within the Analog business, just some end market color on computing, wireless infrastructure, auto, industrial. Did any market particularly stand out either in Q1 or in terms of the 2Q guidance?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay, I certainly can do that, but I'll have to do it for TI overall. I don't give those inputs collected by segment, but I'll make these segment discussions maybe as we go through. So industrial, which affects both Embedded Processing as well as Analog, and we noted specifically Analog SVA, as well as High Performance Analog, we're seeing strength mostly driven by the U.S. and China. Europe and Japan, both continue to be subdued there. I'd have to say it's like everything else, the customers are operating more or less hand-to-mouth. They're not giving a lot of extended visibility, but demand there, overall, is clearly rising. Also as we noted, we're seeing strength in automotive. Most of that is being driven by the U.S. market. Probably the weakest on that front would be in Japan. And then I think for the year, we would expect to see China start to build on the strength for TI as well. When we look in the computing market, specifically, we continue to see weakness in the PC market. And that's really being driven, we believe, by -- likely by additional cannibalization of tablets and smartphones. So we'll see where that goes, but that market remains weak. Consumer, I would describe as mixed. Areas like gaming are weak. TV sales, I would say, overall remain weak, but vary by OEM, with the Japanese OEMs probably the ones that are giving up the most in terms of market share. In handsets or mobile communications, I think even as we talked about in the mid-quarter update, first quarter, we saw, overall, I'd say a little stronger than what we had expected there. But that varies pretty significantly by OEM. So overall, did a little better for us, but not uniformly across customers. And that goes across, again, a lot of different products, both the legacy, but it's also some of the products in Analog that we sell into the handset space. And then finally, comms infrastructure remains weak for us in first quarter. That's along the lines of what we described in the mid-quarter update. And that really just is continuing to be driven by constrained operator spending. We don't believe there's an inventory. We think inventory -- I'm sorry, we don't believe there's an inventory issue. We believe inventories in that space generally remain low, but operators just have not picked up their spending. So I guess if I were to summarize, at least as it applies to first quarter, we saw the PC area and we saw the comms infrastructure area both below our expectations coming into the quarter and what we would  describe or characterize as weak. On the flip side, industrial was strong, better than we had expected. Automotive was strong, better than we had expected. And then some of the mobile handset markets also were. Okay, Joe, thank you, and we'll move to your second question.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. And then within the Wireless segment, the stuff that, for you, is discontinued, it was a bit stronger than we thought, both in Q1 and Q2. I wonder if you could address, could that tail be longer in the back half? Or is there sort of a pretty finite life for the next generation of those products comes in and you have a steeper decline?","Ron Slaymaker","We believe that we will have that product line wrapped up by the end of the year. So we have not changed our expectations from the standpoint of the endpoint there. So obviously, there's always some puts and takes there. But it's -- we still expect, by the end of the year, that revenue will essentially be gone. Okay, Joe, thanks for your questions.","Operator","We'll move next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Kevin, one more question on OpEx. Let me try it a different way. If my model is right, in the last 10 years, I think your SG&A has been consistently below your R&D expense. And when I compare you to more of the pure-play Analogs, ADI, Linear, they're SG&A expense is 20% to 30% below their R&D expense. So I understand that there are some near-term issues you have to take care of, but what will be the trigger for you to lower SG&A below the $1.5 billion R&D expense, as your model becomes closer to what we would think of as a pure-play analog embedded supplier?","Kevin P. March","I think that to look at our history probably isn't a really good predictor, because our history has a big chunk of wireless in it for an extended period of time with a substantial R&D build. So I would offer to you that, that would distort any historical analysis of TI, as a starting point. Beyond that, I think perhaps the biggest thing that's going to be different between TI and other Analog and Embedded Processing players, or potentially different, is the fact that we had made a conscious decision, and we made it a number of years ago, to have a significantly larger sales force than any of our competitors. And that's really on the back of the fact that we have a significantly larger catalog of products than any of our competitors and therefore, there's a lot more to be sold. And the result of that, of course, as we have seen, has been that we have actually been able to achieve market share from our competitors over the last few years, on the back of a larger portfolio of products and a larger sales force. So all that being said, to say that there is no intent to go off and do some kind of significant readjustment to the size of our SG&A bucket. In fact, it's a conscious effort on our part to make sure that we have the world's largest sales force. There will be some costs coming out of the SG&A as we wind down the last of the Wireless sites, specifically the one in Europe that Ron was talking about earlier, and that's subject to finalizing our discussions with the Works Council in Europe. Once that's complete, we would expect that the SG&A to support that site would come out of our costs and take our SG&A levels down a little bit, but I don't think it will achieve the kind of ratio that you are alluding to there.","Ron Slaymaker","Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, Ron. So second question is on gross margins and capacity utilization. As your mix starts to improve, are you still comfortable with the 75% fall-through to gross margin? What are the puts and takes in that? And when you acquired all the capacity, I understand the cash costs a little bit, but when you acquired all that capacity, global growth expectations already different than what they are right now. So what kind of checks do you have in place to make sure that you are able to utilize all the capacity so it doesn't become a drag on margins in some reasonable period of time, the next, whatever, 2, 3, 4 years?","Kevin P. March","Well, I think I counted maybe a couple questions in there, so let me see if I can remember them all. On the fall-through, we remain comfortable with what we talked about, only by virtue of the fact that, that's what our history has shown us. And that is, through the course of the cycle, up and down, we average 75% fall-through on the delta revenue. Interestingly enough, in any one quarter, you practically never see that 75% fall-through. But across the cycle, you'll see that. And we don't see any reason why the future would be different than what history has shown us for a number of cycles. So I wouldn't expect that to change, in light of the fact that we'll begin to increase our utilization. As to how much capacity are we comfortable with, once again, the utilization charges that we talk about here, in fact, a lot of that is noncash. We've talked for several quarters in a row now, that it's probably half or less is going to be cash related and the rest is noncash. And cash is extremely important because obviously, that results in free cash flow for our shareholders, which I believe when we talk to them, most of them say it's quite important in the context of us being able to provide them with dividends and ongoing stock buybacks. So we will remain focused on the benefit of the free cash flow that this strategy employs for us, as opposed to trying to make adjustments solely for the benefit of a GPM percent calculation, that may or may not benefit free cash flow going forward. So with that being said, there are no plans, other than what we've already announced, for changing the size of our installed manufacturing capacity. And those plans that we've already announced, well the ones we announced 1.5 years ago, and that is the closure of an old small factory that we have in Hiji, Japan, and the closure of an old factory that we have in Houston, both of which will be closed in the second half of this year or by the second half of this year.","Ron Slaymaker","And Vivek, interestingly, when we talk to our large shareholders, which most of which are very long-term in their investment horizon, they describe the idea of buying capacity on the cheap for pennies on the dollar and holding it, even if it's a number of years until we need it, as a no-brainer. And in fact, I think that reflects their own investment style with stock. So again, we feel like we are very well aligned with our largest shareholders in terms of that strategy, and we think we'll continue to deliver good returns with that strategy. Okay, Vivek, thank you for your questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the underutilization charges that you mentioned, Kevin, I think it was -- you said $150 million in this last quarter. Any way to give us a clue on what revenue level those underutilization charges will disappear? And I fully realize that it's more about utilization than revenues. But just to simplify it, any answer on that front will be helpful.","Kevin P. March","I can't give you a specific number on that because it's a mix of the optimal loadings in all the various factories that we have around the world. And we have more than 20 factories around the world, so I don't have a precise answer for you. But I think a 50,000-foot way of thinking about it, is that we have characterized that we believe that we have enough installed capacity to support something approaching $18 billion of revenue. And so in theory, if we went to 100% utilization on that, we clearly do not have an underutilization charge at that revenue level. In fact, underutilization charges never assume that you get to 100% utilization. They assume that you get to something less than that. And again, that varies by factory, and I don't have a precise answer for you on that, Ross.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Nice try, Ross. Do you have a follow-on question?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, maybe I'll get a little closer with this one. Similar to the prior question on when is SG&A going to go down, actually if I flip that around, I look at your peer group, the R&D as a percentage of sales for most of your analog peers is significantly higher than where it seems you guys are going to be exiting this year. Again, I know you have the Other segment that you don't have to utilize as much, but do you think you can keep the share gains going at whatever pace they have been, with R&D as a percentage of sales being so much below your peer group?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Ross, I'd be cautious on the analysis that you're doing. Because of course, with the segments we reveal only the revenue and the operating profit or PFO. In fact, when you're trying to do your R&D analysis, you're doing it at the company level. And I'd remind you that the comments I made earlier on the call, the level of R&D that we spend in the Other segment is very, very low. And so, in fact, the proportion that's being spent in Analog and EP is probably a little higher mathematically than what you're getting, just like at the company level. In the meantime, again, we have over 100,000 products, we sell them to over 100,000 customers. We actually think that we have plenty of opportunity to continue selling those products -- even more of those products to the same customers, as well as new products to the same customers or new customers. So we're not worried about the R&D spend being able to give us expansion to our portfolio. We're quite confident with where we're at.","Ron Slaymaker","Yes. And, Ross, I would just add that, keep in mind, the reductions that we're doing are, as a result, almost wholly due to the Wireless restructuring, not Analog, not Embedded Processing. And so going forward, we're probably spending at comparable levels in those 2 segments, the Analog and Embedded Processing, than we have in past. And you've seen our results in the past translating to market share gains. So I don't think there's any issue with our spending level, with our portfolio expansion. I'll just give an example, in Embedded Processing, we took the number of products that we have in our portfolio up by 20%. I think that's a reasonably significant expansion in a single year and reflects what's a pretty aggressive R&D spend there. Okay, Ross. I believe that was your follow-up question.","Operator","We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Ron, you did go through the end market breakdown. I just had a question. I'm trying to reconcile the industrial strength that you saw, and you seem to be seeing, with we've had a couple of big and harbingers of that market, GE, as well as, this morning, Caterpillar, come out and sort of have a very cautionary tone. So in your opinion and looking back, is that kind of factored in with the inventory being low and so you continue to see that market strengthening? Or does it take a longer time for that to filter through the order book?","Ron Slaymaker","Ambrish, I don't know that I can correlate what we're seeing to what those 2 guys are describing. I mean, frankly, we don't sell a lot of semiconductors to Caterpillar. And I don't mean to diminish that they may be reflecting something that's going on at a broader macro level, but a lot of what we're seeing in industrial is almost the same type of trend that you see in automobiles. Automobile unit sales can be flat, and we still have a really nice growth opportunity because of the rapid penetration, increased penetration of semiconductors in those markets. When you go into other industrial markets like lighting, and the rapid escalation of LED lighting versus CFL or incandescent, I can tell you, we have a much higher semiconductor content in LED lighting than we do in the prior generations. And that's just an example. I mean you can go across smart thermostats compared to the old electromechanical, you can just find one after the other, where we're now selling significant semiconductor content into those industrial markets, where historically, we sold very little. So I'm not giving up hope that we're going to turn Caterpillar into a huge customer someday. But again, not here and now today. So we're -- things can always change, but we're pretty confident in terms of what we are seeing with our own business. Do you have a follow-on?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I do. And I hope you can sell a lot more content into those GE turbines [ph] as well. My follow-up is on SVA. Last quarter, it kind of went in line with the TI core Analog and this quarter, it's up. Could you please just give us some qualitative measure, or quantitative, as to how SVA is performing? And I know it's early in the turnaround, but just also where are you with the consignment that SVA is going through?","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. There's a couple things to say about SVA. One, I think the last couple of quarters have been very encouraging in terms of just the relative performance of SVA compared to the rest of our Analog business. It has been, compared to the other 3 businesses that we have, it's right at the top over the 2 periods. Now those are only 2 quarters out of a year, but keep in mind, our expectations for a year or 2, was that SVA moves up to market level growth, meaning we don't lose market share through those businesses, but we expect that it would probably lag the remainder of our Analog businesses, where they have been gaining share historically. So really good results for the last 2 quarters, still a lot of work to be done. We're not putting a fork in it yet, but it's feeling really good thus far. Status of consignment is, I think as we described back in third quarter, we expect -- we had a total of $100 million, basically, to convert over to consignment. We've done about 1\/3 of that in each of the last 2 quarters, so we're about 2\/3 of the way through. And our expectation is that, for the remaining 1\/3, it will probably take 2 more quarters to get through that consignment changeover completely. So 2\/3 of the way through, 1\/3 to go over the next 2 quarters. Okay, Ambrish. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. The first question, I know you don't talk about linearity, but can you at least talk a little bit about what the puts and takes are for your guidance range?","Ron Slaymaker","Oh, not really, Tore. I mean, there are so many variables, any one of which that can affect whether things are going up or down. But suffice to say, it's hard enough to get the total right without trying to go public on all of the individual assumptions. So obviously, we look at it at that detail level, but in terms of our public guidance and comments, we'll just keep it at the total. Okay. You have a follow-on question? That was pretty easy.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, thanks. This is for Kevin. You're guiding for CapEx to be $500 million. I think you just spent $83 million. So should we model that pretty steep increase in the second half? And if so, what's that for?","Kevin P. March","Yes, Tore, we're holding to $500 million on the CapEx forecast. And we expect that probably most of that will be for wafer fab equipment, with -- I'm sorry, [ph]  for assembly test operations with the balance for wafer fab equipment. And that's really just a question of making sure that we've got enough capacity for the volumes that we're actually producing. Keep in mind that, at level there, there's a little bit of capacity expansion but to a large extent, it's line rebalancing and just making sure that things are -- as the demand on certain flows change, we can rebalance the line to handle those demands. I'm comfortable that we will remain inside that CapEx forecast this year at $500 million.","Ron Slaymaker","Okay. Tore, thank you. And I think at this point, we'll give you back a minute of your time. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","Thank you.

Bernstein & Co., LLC","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Christopher Danely - Citigroup Inc.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' 2Q 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","Dave Pahl","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.","For today\u2019s call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I\u2019ll be covering the following topics: First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the second quarter and second, some details by segment and end market. Rafael will then review: Profitability, capital management results, and then the outlook, after that we will open the call for Q&A.","Starting with the high-level summary of our second quarter financial results. The quarter progressed about as we expected, with revenue decreasing 9% from a year ago due to broad-based weakness. In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 16% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses\u2019 year-on-year growth decelerated.","Earnings per share were $1.36, including a $0.07 benefit for items not in our original guidance. The benefit includes $0.04 due to the previously announced sale of our Greenock, Scotland fab, with the balance primarily due to discrete tax benefits. With that backdrop, I\u2019ll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.","In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. We remain committed to returning all our free cash flow to owners.","Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.9% of revenue, up from 36.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.","We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to our owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.","Moving on, I\u2019ll now provide some details on the second quarter by segment and end market. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 6% due to declines in High Volume, Power and Signal Chain. Embedded Processing revenue declined by 16% from the year-ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers.","Next, I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive together declined upper-single digits due to broad-based weakness. Personal electronics declined low-double digits also due to broad-based weakness. In communications equipment, revenue declined sequentially, but was about even from a year ago versus a weak compare. And lastly, enterprise systems declined.","In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.","Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?","Rafael Lizardi","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.36 billion, or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $810 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21.1% of revenue, within our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.57 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long-term.","Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Restructuring charges\/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our Greenock, Scotland facility.","Operating profit was $1.51 billion, or 41.1% of revenue. Operating profit was down 12% from a year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 43.7%, down from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 33.5%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.","Other income and expense was $52 million benefit, up $28 million primarily due to investment gains and tax-related items. Net income in the second quarter was $1.31 billion, or $1.36 per share, which included a $0.07 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we\u2019ve discussed.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.80 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $284 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.93 billion.","In the second quarter, we paid $722 million in dividends and repurchased $863 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.59 billion. In total, we have returned $8.01 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.22 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%.","Inventory days were 143, up eight days from a year-ago, and down one-day sequentially. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the third quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and will manage it with our long-term objectives in mind.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.53, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019.","In closing, we have just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. As we stated last quarter, if you look at the last 30 years of history in our industry, cycles are always different, but typically you could see four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. Again, we are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective.","Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products.","We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","Dave Pahl","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, when you reported three months ago, I think things we\u2019re looking somewhat more downbeat. And I was curious, Rafael or Dave, how would you characterize the current environment. Is it similar? Is it better? Is it worse? I'm just trying to put your Q3 outlook which is 3% to 4% sequential growth. It's below seasonal trend, but it's still up sequentially. So, I'm just going to get a better sense of how you're seeing the broader environment versus three months ago?","Dave Pahl","Yes, I'll start, and if Rafael wants to add anything, he's welcome too. I think as we stated, the quarter came in about as we expected and that was really across the board. Really all the end markets performed about as we had expected. We\u2019ve just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. And I think that if you look at history, things are always different when you look at cyclicality, but I think things are performing as we would expect.","Rafael Lizardi","The only thing I would add is we're ready for any scenario. The economy strengthens, we're ready. If it run sideways or if it weakens, we're ready. And that's both a strategic comment on how we position the company, focus on auto and industrial and analog products inside of that, but also operationally with our inventory strategy and other things that we're doing to continue to strengthen the company.","Dave Pahl","Do you have a follow-on to that?","Vivek Arya","Yes, thanks, Dave. So, for my follow-on, I'm curious the sales to China, how is the environment there? I assume that you don't have a lot of direct specific exposure to Huawei. But what's the demand environment I guess in China and outside of China? But are conditions better outside of China? And within China, how is the demand environment outside of Huawei?","Dave Pahl","So, I think we've said before that Huawei is about 3% to 4% of our revenue overall. It's a mix of comms equipment and some handset in there and some other products. And if you look at comms equipment overall, it's 11% of our revenue. We had seen some nice growth in our 5G products, as we've talked about before. And if you look from a regional standpoint, I'd say there's nothing unusual going on.","We've talked about that in the past when there was. And certainly, if you look at where we ship product, that's not always indicative of actual end demand or \u2013 and look-through those economies, meaning we may ship into one region and that may get packaged up and shipped to another region before it's actually consumed. So overall, about the regions, they came in as we expected and nothing unusual. We didn't see anything unusual this quarter. So, thank you for that.","We\u2019ll go to next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We are here now from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Guys, based on the comments that you just made, it appears as though your view on the cycle hasn't really changed over the past couple of months. That said, I think you guys decided to delay the new fab. So just curious what kind of thought process went into the decision to push the fab?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So just to clarify, we said back in our February capital management call and really have been saying since then, that we planned to begin building that next factory in the next few years, and that hasn't changed. There was a filing and it was a proposed amendment to a local tax abatement schedule that has caused some confusion on that topic. But just to say again, as we said back in February, those plans hadn't changed. Do you have a follow-on?","Toshiya Hari","I do. Thanks Dave. And then just going back to the U.S., China situation, I realize your business tends to be very sticky. But has the backdrop impacted your ability to conduct business in China at all? Or have you sensed any \u2013 just the market share in your business? Thank you.","Rafael Lizardi","No. This is Rafael. No, not at all.","Dave Pahl","Yes, and I'd just say that our markets, because they're diverse and you see market share doesn't move around quickly, it's just good quality markets. And one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity I think helps us in markets like this in situations like that in particular, so. Okay. Thank you, Toshiya.","We'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you very much. I had a question on gross margin flow-through, fall-through and especially as it relates to utilization and inventory. So free cash flow 12 months trailing, which you always point us too correctly, which is kind of in the same ballpark that you had last quarter, but then inventory was down.","And the fall through the margins is much higher incrementally, and I know it's not the same every quarter, but I was just curious if there's something going on there. What are the puts and takes that caused the incremental fall through to be higher?","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. And I'll take that. From the way you want to think about it is our fall through, as we have said before, is about 70% to 75%. And you want to look at that on a year-on-year basis. And even then, this is sometimes a little less, a little more but that's the right way to look at it, and this quarter is actually right between that 70% and 75%.","The other thing I would mention is over the longer-term period, over the last many years and we expect this to continue, you're seeing the benefit of 300-millimeter manufacturing. That is part of our competitive advantage, manufacturing technology.","And as we have talked about before, it's just a structural cost advantage because of the geometry of the wafer and the relatively small incremental cost that goes into producing the 300-millimeter wafer versus 200-millimeter wafer. So, we expect that benefit to continue to accrue to gross margins and ultimately free cash flow margin, which is the one that drives value for the owners of the company.","Dave Pahl","Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes, I did and this is more blocking and tackling and I know you guys have correctly frame from calling a cycle because everybody's track record, including my owners absolutely wrong on that front, but bookings, cancellations and lead times, where are we on these metrics? Thank you.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. I think if you look at those metrics overall, I'd say that inventory in the channel, and more broadly, I think you're looking at kind of the cyclical metrics that you looked at. Inventory and channel was down about a day. Still, it's about 4.5 weeks and has been steady at that for a couple of quarters now.","Order rates, when we look at those looked normal as they came through. Cancellations were down a little bit from last quarter, but really didn't change much. And then our lead times overall have remained stable.","Certainly, they were stable as things got more heated in the industry, but \u2013 and of course there's always areas that we would still be tight on today, but in general, the lead times have remained very stable, so.","Dave Pahl","Thank you, Ambrish. And we'll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on Huawei. You answered sort of generally, but specifically, what do you have embedded in your guidance regarding Huawei? Are you still contemplating selling product to them? Or are you not? What's in the guidance regarding that customer?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So, I\u2019d say, Stacy, just over this past quarter, we obviously had halted shipments when the order was given. Since then, we've resumed shipments of the products that we've determined we could ship that are in compliance with the U.S. regulations. So overall, in this quarter, things came in as we expected. And as I stated before, that would be inclusive of communications equipment, where Huawei would sit. So, in our guidance, we obviously have that in for the quarter. And if there was something unusual that we are keeping out, our practice has been to call that out and there's nothing unusual that we're planning on. Do you have a follow-on?","Stacy Rasgon","Yes, I do. Thank you. Well, the stockpiling and consignment overall strategy that you've been doing, it's been going on for a while. How much do you think that has increased utilization over the last few quarters as you've been rolling that out? And how much longer do you anticipate driving that strategy before it reaches completion?","Rafael Lizardi","Let me start, and then, Dave, you want to \u2013 if you want to comment. But we've had an inventory strategy for many years. We just continue to tweak it over time, make it better, stronger. And as the cycle started in third quarter or so, then we deploy some specific tools during that time to then take advantage of that situation and use what we call our wafer starts. We devoted an increasing share of that to the low-volume inventory strategy. We have built a lot of that but it's not complete. But incrementally, it's going to be less going forward than what it was in the last few quarters because you get to obviously diminishing returns at some point in that.","Dave Pahl","Yes. And I'll point out, obviously, you saw our inventory dollars were down sequentially. They're actually down year-on-year. Our inventory days were down sequentially even with those planned builds of those low-volume parts, and we feel really good about being able to do that in our operations. The second part of your question there was what is the impact of consignment have on utilization. It really has no impact at all. Basically, it optically and, by definition, just puts more inventory on our books. But even if the inventory didn\u2019t change in the channel, it just would put pressure and optically put pressure on our inventory, and that's going on as well.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes. I want to make one more comment on this topic. Remember what inventory is about, right? What is objective inventory? It's not about maximizing utilization or gross margins or anything like that. It\u2019s about maintaining high levels of customer service. So, what we have done is deployed our cash to inventory. And as Dave said, inventory actually decreased. But we think that decrease, we built some inventory of low-volume parts. That now puts us in a great position as we move into the third quarter and beyond. You have that inventory of low volume that is generally difficult to build. We have it ready, so that we'll be able to serve our customers on the other side of this very well.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We will hear now from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. May I ask a question? I want to stick on the consignment topic, but just a slightly different spin. I think you've said in the last call, last few calls that it's upwards of two-thirds of your revenues go through consignment. That's increased substantially over the last three, five, 10 years. Why do you think your year-over-year revenue performance is so similar to your broader peer group if you're controlling that inventory? I would think all else being equal, you wouldn't have to deal with the distribution channel burning inventory and weighing on your revenues during a period like this.","Rafael Lizardi","I'll give you one comment, and Dave, you may want to chime in. What I would tell you is, maybe take into account, in the last four quarters or so, five quarters, we have gone through the next phase of consignment and we have added, let's say, $30 million to $40 million of revenue to that program per quarter during that time, for a total of close to $200 million. We probably still have one more quarter to go where that is \u2013 where that's going to happen and maybe through the end of the year, but it's getting to the diminishing point. But that is revenue that from the P&L we had sort of disappeared, right, but obviously the demand hasn't changed.","That end demand really hasn't changed. It's just that now it goes into our inventory and the revenues delayed, but it just puts us in a much better position to then own that inventory, distribute it better where it's needed, work with our manufacturing facilities better to determine what's needed to be built for \u2013to replenish that inventory. So, it's just a better way to operate.","Dave Pahl","Yes, and I'll just to add that when you think of one of our competitive advantage, which is the reach of our market channels, this is just one component of what we're doing to have a closer, more direct relationship with our customers. And we think that ultimately servicing them better with product will benefit them and therefore benefit us. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?","Ross Seymore","Yes, one that's a little bit more housekeeping, Dave. From an end market point of view, you went through and gave the year-over-years. So, could you give the quarter-over-quarters beyond the comms side? And was there a reason you put industrial and automotive together saying there were down upper single-digits year-over-year? Usually, you split those?","Dave Pahl","No. Yes. Sure. So, the first is they performed similarly. Industrial was a little weaker. Auto was a little less weak but in the same zip code, and that was the same for the sequential. Together, they grew low single-digits and that same profile was the same. Personal electronics grew high single-digits with broad-based seasonal growth. Comms equipment, as I mentioned earlier, had declined, and then enterprise systems actually grew sequentially. Okay, thank you, Ross.","And we\u2019ll go the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the most recent SIA data, April, May sales were down about 10% year-over-year for the global Analog segment, while you guys were only down 6%. You clearly outperformed the Analog segment last year as well. So outside of the end market mix, i.e., better comm equipment sector. Can you guys help us understand any product areas where you're either capturing market share or seeing strong dollar content growth?","Dave Pahl","Well, yes, so first, Harlan, I\u2019d always be careful to read too much into any of those numbers in the short-term. I think when you look at the share gains, they just really need to be even over several year. And I think that's \u2013 even in that case, I think we come out very well. I think especially we continue to do well in industrial and automotive. As I mentioned earlier, that is, we believe that those will be the most important markets to semiconductors and industrial in particular. And we've got a lot of programs and a lot of thought going into how to get better and get stronger to be able to service those markets. Do you have a follow-on?","Harlan Sur","Yes. Thanks for the insights there. I know we have to be careful on how we interpret this number, but can you guys just tell us what the book-to-bill ratio is for the June quarter?","Dave Pahl","Yes. So, you set me up perfect there, because I always have the preamble that I'll give it. I've debated honestly whether I should continue to give it, but I will. Just because we do, but there is a lot of noise that's in it. So, it was 0.94% and it was 1.06% a year-ago and 0.99% last quarter, so and I'll just remind everyone that we have the majority of the revenue on consignment. So, we don't get orders in advance for that. We've got backlog and the consignment the orders in the backlog are all consistent with the guidance that we gave. So, thank you Harlan. And I believe we will go to the next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from Chris Danley with Citigroup.","Christopher Danely","Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you just talk about the linearity of orders during the quarter? And I guess more specifically, have you seen any change in customer or channel behavior since the Huawei reinstatement and the \u2013 I guess the threat of $300 billion in additional tariffs was taken away a few weeks ago?","Dave Pahl","Yes, Chris. Really no changes on that front, I think when we look at the linearity, it came in fairly normal, minus the stock shipment to Huawei. But once we determined that we could continue to resume most of those products. It really got back to normal pretty quickly. Do you have a follow-on?","Christopher Danely","Yes. Given, we're in this \u2013 I guess mildly depressed or sluggish or flaccid or whatever you want to call it kind of environment. Have you guys changed your thoughts on kind of long-term CapEx?","Rafael Lizardi","The short answer is, no. We are \u2013 as we said in our capital management strategy, our guide on CapEx is 6% and we'll continue to be 6% and that's without buildings. So of course, as we've talked about, we announced the new factory \u2013 the new 300 millimeter factory that we build in Richardson, Texas in the next few years. Outside of that, we'll be running about 6%.","Dave Pahl","Okay. Thank you, Chris. And operator, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more call.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me okay?","Dave Pahl","We can, Mark.","Mark Lipacis","Okay. Your inventories declined in dollars and days. What do you think happens to your inventories on your balance sheet in the September quarter? And Dave, on the inventory commentary, I believe you said you characterized channel inventory as kind of in a stable range. Would you call them stable in a normal and healthy level? Or would you characterize them somewhat differently?","Rafael Lizardi","Let me start, and Dave, if you want to jump in. But let me first step back to the objective for inventory to remind everybody and, as I said earlier in the call, is to maintain high levels of customer service. We also want to minimize obsolesces of that inventory and improve our asset utilization, but the main thing is to maintain high levels of customer service. And our target is 1.15 to 1.45. So last quarter \u2013 two quarters ago, we went above that target, 1.52. But then last quarter, we're at 1.44 in one \u2013 first quarter and then second quarter, we just finished at 1.43, so both of those inside of our target.","Dave Pahl","Yes. And I\u2019ll just add again that even outside of those numbers, we\u2019ve made really good progress of executing to building those low volume parts and we believe that's important, so we can continue to service customers well. In the second part of your question, Mark was, yes, it was down a little bit sequentially on the day\u2019s basis in distribution, still at about 4.5 weeks. That is a healthy level.","And I would say that, that number will structurally kind of work its way down as we're implementing more of this revenue on consignment, and that's a great thing for our distributors. It's a great thing for our customers and it does require that we\u2019ll be carrying some more inventory on our balance sheet, but we think that, that's a good investment in working capital. Do you have a follow-on, Mark?","Mark Lipacis","Yes, please. Thank you. The follow-up is, have you been noticing since the U.S. and China trade debate. Have you been noticing any shift in the supply chain from a standpoint of where things are being manufactured not your own Texas Instruments supply chain, but where you're shipping to \u2013 are you shipping more outside of China or is everything fairly stable? Thank you.","Rafael Lizardi","Yes, I'll take that. It's too early to tell. We read some of the same media reports and anecdotal comments that people make on that front, but it's too early to tell. So, we'll watch how things evolve in that front over the next few years.","So, I want to finish with a few comments on key items for everybody to remember. We will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products; and industrial and automotive, the best markets. We will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy, and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company.","And finally, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share dollars over the long-term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company.","Dave Pahl","Thank you for listening. A replay will be available on the web and have a good night.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19994":["Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Q3 2017 Earnings Call October 24, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Analysts","Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:USA) LLC","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Operator","Good day everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com\/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.","This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.","I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets.","In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26.","With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue.","We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output.","We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all of free cash flow to our owners.","I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in power and signal chain. High volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017.","Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even, with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew, primarily due to servers.","We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.","Raphael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points.","Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.","Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.79 billion, or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter.","Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year-ago, and for Embedded Processing was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.","Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to earnings per share.","Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation.","Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.","As Dave mentioned already, in September we announced we will increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share, or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past five years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter.","For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividend and repurchased $650 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividends, or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability.","Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.","Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. These combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 119, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%.","Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit.","Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website under the Financial Summary Data section.","Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.","With that, let me turn it back to Dave.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow up. Rebecca?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And first we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. This is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. So my first question is, last year you guided Q4 pretty conservatively and ended up reporting growth that was about twice as fast. How would you contrast the demand environment this year versus last year? And the reason why I bring this up is because your Q4 outlook of down 10% seems to be below seasonal. And I'm wondering, if that outlook really holds true, what are the areas of weakness that you're seeing that's driving this? Thanks.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. So I think that if you look at our guidance, I'd say that we're not indicating that anything is atypical that's occurring. And I'd just remind you that whenever we've had something that's been unusual, whether that's been by market or by sector or sometimes even by customer, we've been pretty clear on that and would share it, and we've got nothing to share. So I'd just point out that if you look at the range of our guidance, that's going to vary and can comprehend several different scenarios. And at the midpoint, on a year on year basis, we'll grow about 9%, which we consider to be pretty robust. So, do you have a follow-on?","Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. I guess looking at your free cash flow per share growth, the last couple of quarters, it's kind of trended below the longer-term 8% to 10% that you traditionally see. I'm wondering why that is and what are the catalysts to get that back up to where it has been. Thanks.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, Adam, thanks for giving me opportunity to talk about that. On free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis, and that is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same basis. And the difference is higher working capital, particularly accounts receivables and tax payments. If you look at the accounts receivable from 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016, that actually drained whereas from 3Q 2016 to 3Q 2017, it built. So that is a source of cash in one case and a use of cash in another case. But, and in the case of the tax payments, we had a higher, disproportionately higher tax payment in the most recent comparison versus the previous trailing 12-month comparison.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Great. Thank you, Adam. Tell Vivek we said hello, and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello. Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution, the free cash flow generation and the capital return. Clearly the demand trends are pretty strong in the markets that you serve. Maybe you could just talk about the demand trends from a geographical perspective. I think last quarter you saw year over year growth in most geographies. I'm just wondering if the strength continues to be broad based.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, Harlan, I would say that certainly the demand was broad based. If you look across our product lines, we've got 65 to 70 different product lines, and the demand was very strong across those as well as strong across the region. So we had revenue up in three of the four regions year on year in Europe, Asia and the U.S., and it was about even in Japan.","And again, I just always remind that when we give regional color, that's where we ship the product. That's what we can measure. Where that product actually ends up from a regional standpoint, we really don't have visibility into. Do you have a follow-on?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks for the color there. On the OpEx front, great operating leverage. You drove 12% sequential growth in sales, but your OpEx declined by 3%. So you guys are driving some serious leverage here. The OpEx as a percent of sales is actually just below your target range, and so I guess the question is, what drove the sequential decline in the OpEx. And how should we think about the OpEx profile just over the next few quarters?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, I'll take that. For OpEx, we think of that in terms of, from a model standpoint, we think of it as a percent of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and for the last couple years, we've actually been running at about 23%. And in the current trailing 12-months, we're about 22% of revenue. So we have said that in a stable environment, which we are, we can run in the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%. So we've been running at about 22%, so that's well within that.","Of course to us, OpEx are investments, and obviously that goes for R&D, but even inside of G&A we think of a large portion there as investment. So in R&D of course we're focusing on industrial and automotive, because those are the best markets. where semiconductor growth is happening. But in the G&A front, we have many investments there on ti.com and demand creation just to continue building on our reach of channels, reach of markets, competitive advantage that we have talked about.","Before we go to the next caller, I'd like to just make a comment on the previous question on working capital. I want to stress that while our accounts receivables increased in that last comparison, the delta days sales outstanding actually decreased by 1 day. So it's at 34. So that just goes to show you how healthy the account receivable balance is. I wanted just to clarify that.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay, great. Thank you, Harlan, and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, Ross Seymore.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. This is Jerrell (17:41) on behalf of Ross. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Just asking about the general end markets here, could you provide some end market detail in terms of how they trended quarter on quarter in addition to year on year?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Sure, Jerrell (17:54). If you look at industrial, it increased with most sectors growing. And again, we've got 14 sectors there, so fairly broad based. Automotive increased with most sectors growing. Personal electronics increased, as one would expect, as you move into the holiday builds with most sectors growing there. Comms equipment was even, and enterprise systems grew due to both servers and projectors. Do you have a follow-on?","Unknown Speaker","Yes. Just a question on the report here. So your September quarter revenues exceeded the high end of your prior guidance, and it's the first time in about a year that happened. However, gross margins expanded just 20 basis points. I think we were expecting more. So given the magnitude of the revenue beat, why didn't higher revenues result in more than 20 basis points of gross margin fall through?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. What I would tell you is that generally what we suggest and what we recommend to analysts and investors to think about our fall through \u2013 in the 70% to 75% range. But that is over the long haul, over a relatively long amount of time. In any one quarter, that fall through can be a little different.","Now for example, in the comparison versus a year ago, which arguably, I would argue is more relevant as it has more time obviously in between, that was close to an 85% fall through, right. The increase in gross margin was 240 basis points, just as an example of a comparison to the sequential basis.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. Thank you, Jerrell (19:38). And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. I guess my first question, I'm just kind of curious. When you look at year over year growth now for the core business, Analog and Embedded, you've had very healthy sort of double digit year over year growth. I'm wondering if you could kind of comment to what extent you think that's share gains, to what extent you think that is just easy compares, to what extent you think that might be a little bit of overheating relative to customer order activity. And you did a fantastic job on your own balance sheet, kind of managing inventories. I'm wondering if you could give us some color around customer inventory levels.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. So, John, I think that if you look at general market conditions, they're similar to 90 days ago and certainly continue to remain strong. However, I think it's still yet to be seen how long that will extend over how long of a period of time. So we've got no indications of inventories growing or double ordering. And like I pointed out last quarter, history suggests we never really see that, those types of things ahead of time.","But I think again, it's important to qualify what we can see. So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory, and that remains at about four weeks. It's even both sequentially and year on year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet, and we don't see any unusual signals or other things like expedites that would suggest that there's issues inside of that. And our visibility of course into inventory beyond that and down our customers' channels, we just can't see that of course.","So we just remain focused, as we have for a long time, focusing on both our internal manufacturing and internal inventory strategies. And we're focused on trying to keep lead time steady, which they have. Delivery metrics really high because that's what gives customers confidence that they can get the product when they need it.","So you have a follow-on, John?","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. I do for Rafael. As I think Harlan mentioned, you guys did a fantastic job on operating leverage in the quarter. When you look at absolute operating profits though, there's still a pretty meaningful gap between the Embedded business and the Analog business. And I think you've commented in the past that, theoretically, there's no reason why that gap can't close over time. I'm kind of curious. When I look sequentially, the operating leverage in the Embedded business was particularly high. I think the fall through was almost 86% Q on Q. I'm just kind of curious. Have we reached a scale point in that business where we would expect fall through to be higher from here on out and that gap to close more quickly? Any comments around that would be helpful.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Sure. Well, to your point, the profitability of that business has in fact improved significantly. On a year on year basis, profit from operation is up 673 basis points. But at the end of the day, the main objective here is to grow free cash flow. We think that is \u2013 we believe that is what really drives value for the owners of the company, so and then return all that free cash flow to the owners.","So we're not particularly focused on any one of those percentages because there are many ways to drive that free cash flow and one of them is expanding the margins. But then the other one is just growing the top line at the same margin, right. So that's the key message that the core objective that we're trying to achieve.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","And that'll come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, there. This is James Limz (23:52) and Shirley Hu on for Stacy. Sorry if we missed it, but we were just wondering what book-to-bill was for the quarter.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Book-to-bill was, it was 1.0.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","1.0. Yes.","Unknown Speaker","1.0.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","So.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","And again, we always, we give that number. I would say that always be cautious with it because we've got 60% of our revenue that's on consignment that we don't carry any backlog or don't get any orders in advance. So that's part of the reason why we don't focus on it. Do you have a follow-on?","Unknown Speaker","Yes. I guess so. We were just hoping for some more color on the OpEx and why it was a bit light and just how you see that trajectory going forward.","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Well, it came in about as expected. So I wouldn't characterize it as a bit light. And as I mentioned earlier on an earlier question, on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how we think is appropriate to look at, is, came in at 22%. I think in the last couple years it's been at 23%. So it's trended a little down over the last few years, but it is well within the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%, which is our expectations when things are stable, which they are now.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Okay. Thank you. We'll go to our next caller, please.","Operator","C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, forward look outlook on gross margins. Can you talk about what you're expecting mix wise and whether that fits in with an incremental gross margin around 70%? Or are there kind of puts and takes around that?","Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated","On gross margins, what we have said before, and we'll continue to say, really hasn't changed our guidance on that is that our general expectation is revenue to pull through at about 70% to 75%. And that's over the long haul, right, not in any one quarter. So you should think about it that way. And as we continue to grow the top line, driven by our investments in analog and embedded from a product standpoint, and industrial, automotive from an end market standpoint, we expect to continue gaining share and that additional revenue to fall through at about those rates.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Do you have a follow on, C.J.?","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yes, please. Could you provide an update on where you are on the 300-millimeter? Interested in terms of utilization rates as well as some of the work you're doing on the back end and other fronts to drive even higher incremental margins. Thanks.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes, you bet. I think, as C.J. asked that question, there are probably callers on the line and listening that aren't familiar. But we've got four competitive advantages, the first of which is our manufacturing and technology. And I think the 300-millimeter is a good example of that strength.","The other three, just quickly, are the breadth of the product portfolio; our channel advantages, which includes the size of our sales force and ti.com; and then just the diversity and longevity across markets and sectors and customers and products, which I think leads for investors a high confidence and a high terminal value of that product portfolio.","But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that. And most chips in the industry are built on 200-millimeter. So we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially most of the analog growth this year, and as we have seen for several years, is supported by 300-millimeter.","We'll actually give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are, but that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter, and we continue to see the benefit.","So thank you for that question, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please.","Operator","William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. You've had for several quarters strength in automotive and industrial, and that continued in the quarter you just reported. In the outlook, I'm wondering if there's any change in terms of the relative strengths of your expected results by end market?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes \u2013 well as you know, we don't provide color below the top line, but certainly if there was anything significant there, we'd call out. And I can tell you there isn't anything significant. And I think if you look at that strength inside of industrial and automotive, I think as we look at third quarter, as it has for some time, that strength has been very broad based.","So, we've got 14 sectors inside of industrial. Most of those have been growing double digits for some time. We continue to direct our investments across those 14, so it's a very intentional investment and return. Same thing in automotive. So we've got diversity across five different sectors. All five of those are contributing to growth. And that diversity is across the product lines, it's across geographies. So we feel really good about that strength. Do you have a follow-on?","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. I do. One more. We're aware that there's been a change in compensation to distributors. It's been pretty well publicized, I think, relative to paying them for demand \u2013 so-called demand creation. I'm wondering if there are still benefits to be made by TI, if there was anything squeezed out in the quarter just reported or anything that's still on the come, either in December or beyond from that change in sort of how you work with distribution. Thank you.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yes. So again, we don't \u2013 we no longer do pay for demand creation. As you indicated, distributors of course will continue to play a role in order fulfillment for our customers. So those relationships have been evolving, especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So as I mentioned earlier, even in this call, that is a unique advantage and includes both ti.com and the size and skill of our sales and apps team.","So those changes began implementation three years ago, for any accounts where we had direct TI resources. That represented about 80% of the TAM. And then later last year, we implemented changes with the remaining 20%. So I'd say a good portion of that is worked through, and it's not significant enough that it's going to make any of these earnings conference calls. So we just continue to invest in our demand creation activities, and we feel really good about the results that that is producing.","So with that, I think we've got time for one more call. Operator?","Operator","And that'll come from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Great.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Hi, Romit.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Hey, Dave. How are you?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Great.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","I just wanted to ask about the revenue growth, if you look at sort of growth over the last 12 months. I mean semiconductor demand, it just seems like there's a resurgence here. We certainly see that looking at the performance of your Analog and Embedded businesses. And that it's more than just \u2013 it's coming from more than just consumer confidence and how they're managing inventories. And I'm just curious, if you look at the performance of Analog and Embedded over the last 12 months, has it changed your outlook for the long-term growth of the company?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yeah, I don't think so, Romit. I think that we're fortunate that we've got investments in capacity and we've got a product portfolio that is very, very diverse. It's rich in automotive and industrial, which are the best growing parts of the market. And I don't think that that changes our outlook over the long term. And the best signal that we get from customers are orders, so we're able to respond to those if things continue to strengthen and strengthen from here. And if they go the other way, we've got a playbook ready to go if that were to happen. So do you have a follow-on?","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Yeah. I mean you talked about automotive, and one of the things that we see is that this shift to electric vehicles has a lot of momentum and that with electric powertrains, we could see demand for power semiconductors accelerate. And I was just curious how you guys think about the opportunity in electric vehicles. Is that a sub-segment that TI is uniquely positioned for?","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","Yeah. I think that our investments in automotive are really directed across five different sectors. So powertrain is one of them, which is primarily EV. So, but if you look at the other spaces like infotainment cluster, passive safety, ADAS or advanced driver assist systems, and body electronics and lighting, we're very intentionally directing our investments across those areas.","So certainly as EVs become a higher mix of units that are sold on an annual basis, we'll benefit from that, but we're not dependent on it. And I think if I bring you back to our four competitive advantages, just that diversity and longevity. We'll benefit from ADAS systems being deployed and as the industry marches forward to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs.","Those are things we'll benefit from, but our business model isn't dependent on them. So we're real excited with the diversity of design wins that we have there, and we think we've got a lot of runway there as well as inside of industrial.","David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated","So with that, we'll wrap up tonight's call, and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. And we do thank everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect."]}}
