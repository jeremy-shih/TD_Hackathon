At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will begin with prepared remarks, followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes, and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com Investor Relations section.","Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call is Blake Nordstrom, Co-President, who will discuss the company's first quarter performance and the outlook for fiscal year 2017. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents; Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores; and Jim Howell, Executive Vice President of Finance and Treasurer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading.","Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store business to one that is more diversified, with multiple ways for customers to shop with us. During this time, we've invested in capabilities to better serve our customers and gain market share. This fueled our e-commerce growth, increased our customer base, and enabled us to expand into new markets.","Through these efforts, we've added nearly $6 billion to our top-line. In keeping our customers at the forefront of everything we do, our business looks very different today. Nearly one-quarter of our sales are from online purchases compared to roughly 5% from 10 years ago. We've added more ways to serve customers through our acquisitions of Trunk Club and HauteLook.","Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to be our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. We offer a variety of services that support our customers' needs around convenience, such as buy online, pick up in store, curbside pick up, and same-day delivery. We continue to invest in critical talent and capabilities around technology, mobile, data analytics, and supply chain.","Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, product and services, represent the core of our brand. We're fortunate to have a high-quality portfolio of 122 full-line stores, with all of our comp stores generating positive cash flow. Furthermore, our stores play an important role in attracting and retaining customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our full-line or Rack stores.","We have strategically grown our off-price business, which represents roughly 30% of sales. It's positioned as our largest source of new customers, with the average age skewing younger than our overall business. About one-third of customers who start shopping at the Rack will also cross-shop in our full-price business. We believe this is a unique competitive advantage in the market.","Because our customers' shopping experience may be influenced by multiple touch points, it's important that we view our business from the perspective of the markets in which we serve them. We're finding that measuring our outcomes through discrete channel metrics, such as store comps, are becoming less relevant. As we continue to head in this direction, we're increasingly looking at our business as full-price and off-price, inclusive of stores and online, to better capture the synergies of having a physical and digital presence.","Now I'd like to discuss our first quarter results. Our earnings were in line with our expectations. We reported earnings per diluted share of $0.37, which included a one-time charge of $0.06 associated with a $650 million debt refinancing in the first quarter. Last year, earnings per share of $0.26 included a $0.10 charge, primarily related to higher credit chargebacks as we transitioned to a change in industry liability rules. When excluding these charges, our first quarter earnings increased 19% on a comparable basis.","While we're pleased with our inventory and expense execution, we're not satisfied with our top-line results. Total sales increased 2.7%, while comps decreased 0.8%. This was generally consistent with the trends we've experienced over the past year.","In our full-price business, total sales decreased 1.7% and comps decreased 2.8%. From a merchandise perspective, we had strength in our Men's and Women's Apparel, while accessories remain soft. Our expansion in full-price gross margin reflected the continued strength of our regular-price sales. Our focus on expanding product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most sought-after brands, while mitigating our business from the promotional environment. These efforts contributed to 100-basis-point increase in the mix of regular-price sales and our full-price business.","In our off-price business, total sales increased 8.7% and comps increased 2.3%. We took additional markdowns on slower-moving items, which impacted gross margins. Overall, our gross profit rate was slightly up from last year. We ended the quarter with inventory growth in line with sales growth.","Moving to our 2017 outlook, our plan is grounded in the sales trends we've experienced over the past year. We are reiterating our earnings per share range of $2.75 to $3, total sales growth of 3% to 4%, and approximately flat comps. As we look ahead, we have a number of opportunities to drive growth. From a merchandising perspective, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness through a greater emphasis on limited distribution and relevant product. Our long-term ambition is for continued double-digit online growth. We've been able to increase the speed and agility with which we roll out enhancements to our product pages, navigation, and content.","Mobile is integral for the customers' shopping experience and accounts for more than half of our online traffic. We're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital experiences. As an example, we're expanding reserve online and try on in stores from 50 to 60 stores this year. This fall, we have our sixth full-line store opening in Canada at Sherway Gardens in Toronto and two full-line store relocations in California, at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla. We have opened six Racks so far in 2017 and have 11 more opening in the fall. Additionally, we're excited about our Manhattan flagship, which is on track to be completed in 2019. We've recently announced a phased approach with the Men's store opening first in spring 2018.","Finally, I'd like to share that we're looking forward to having Anne Bramman join our team as CFO on June 2. She brings extensive retail experience with demonstrated success as a business partner and a steward of capital.","Anne is succeeding Mike Koppel, who retired at the beginning of this month. Over the past 16 years, Mike has provided insight to the leadership team into how we can best utilize the company's resources to produce the outcomes we aspire to achieve. Our financial standing and overall reputation have been greatly enhanced by his leadership. I'd personally like to thank Mike for his many contributions.","I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you, Blake. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We will now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So my question is, can you talk a little bit about the Rack? So total off-price comps in the quarter slowed to, I think, the worst trend in around three years. Was this a result of lower traffic, any changes in competition? And then on the higher off-price markdowns, how much did this actually pressure the gross margin in the quarter?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Matthew, hi. This is Blake. Let's talk about our off-price business. In terms of the Rack, we had a 0.9% decrease. Our plans were to be flat. So we were really close to that. But to be clear, our plan is to beat that. Our goal is to be ahead of our plans, and so we recognized that we had some opportunities. There were a number of things that our team is working on, but there isn't any one thing that I would call out. It's not dissimilar to the performance we had in Q4, where we were down 0.8%. So we have seen a little bit of a softening, but it is close to our plan and we are encouraged by the opportunities and initiatives we have for the balance of this year.","In terms of the online off-price portion of it, it also just missed our plans. We're anniversarying from a year ago the strongest numbers we had. We had a 42% increase a year ago in Q1 in online off-price. We had a 19% performance for Q1 of 2017, and that just missed our plan. And you'll see, as the balance of the year goes on, much stronger numbers with our plan, because we have a plan for the year that is stronger weighted towards the balance end of the year.","In terms of your specifics have we seen anything from competition or other factors, we don't have anything material that we would point out; only that we recognize this falls short of our goals and we've got work to do to improve upon that.","You had, I think, a question on the margin, too. Regarding Q1 margins, I did call out in my remarks that we took higher markdowns in our Rack business predominantly due to some seasonal underperforming merchandise. We had some more boots and coats and other things that we felt necessitated some more markdowns. That had an impact to the overall. The overall margin was relatively flat. Full-price had an improvement in margin, with off-price bringing it down slightly.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please state your question.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the SG&A side. Can you just give us a sense of where you're having the most success bending the cost curve there? Any timing issues impacting the results for this quarter? And just more broadly, how you're thinking about your SG&A growth outlook for the remainder of the year? Thank you.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Well, this is Blake, and I'll start, and I might have Jim weigh in if I miss some things. Again, we made some comments in both the slide, I believe, and then in my comments that technology was a little bit higher, and that was planned. That will level out throughout the year. So that had an impact from a timing point of view for Q1. There have been, throughout last year, a number of initiatives to get our SG&A in line with the business performance. We've been working really hard on that model, and we think that's starting to bear some fruit and that showed both in the Q3, Q4 and this earnings, where we're seeing improved SG&A expense management. So, Jim, is there any other things that you'd call out?","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","No.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So with 23% of your business online, I know that you guys have kind of re-architected your investment in the full-price stores to focus on some of the higher volume doors. I appreciate the comment you gave about the cash flow of all stores. But how do you think about the profitability of some of the lower volume full-line stores and how has that changed over time? Thanks.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take that. Hey, Ed, it's Jamie. Yeah, I would say, we've transitioned our practice of investing in remodels from \u2013 historically it was a pretty democratic approach, where after 10 or 12 years we remodeled a store, kind of regardless of the volume level or performance. And over the last couple years it's transitioned to making more strategic investments in our highest volume stores, those stores that we think play a bigger role in creating our brand. When it comes to our smaller volume stores, yes, they do generate cash. As Blake said, all of our stores are cash flow positive and we make money there.","Obviously, if you do put a bunch of capital into it, that can change that picture. We think we've got a lot of opportunities in the middle, frankly. It's not so much the smallest volume stores. We think those will be fine. It's a lot of the stores in the middle that we have an opportunity to upgrade them, and so we're looking a lot of different alternatives. We're working with our partners on the real estate side of the big mall developers out there that we're partners with are as motivated as we are to upgrade those stores. So we're starting to work on that and we think we'll start to see some progress later this year.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, Ed, let me jump in. This is Erik. What I'd add to that is, increasingly what's most appropriate for us is to look at the business just as one channel, which means for store reinvestment, looking at the online impact that a store has and really viewing our stores as local assets that we can leverage. So as we get better data on the influences that go into customer behavior, that includes both digital experiences and physical store experiences, that better informs decisions like how much capital to put into stores as opposed to just looking at the four-wall contribution of that one store.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon. My question is on sort of the real estate backdrop and things that we're seeing. Can you talk about what you think the ideal footprint for the full-line, and then Nordstrom Rack is perhaps in the next three to five-year horizon? And then secondarily, it would seem that Men's and Women's Apparel kind of the leading categories. I'm wondering if you could talk about the fashion backdrop, and whether \u2013 I know we don't talk about that much these days, but the fashion cycle is kind of in there in the background and it seems to be heightening in early spring. Wonder if you could talk about merchandising there and whether you think that has legs to drive some of the business in the fall season. Thank you very much.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Adrienne, it's Jamie. I'll take the first part around the stores. Full-in stores, we have roughly 120 stores today. It's a healthy fleet, and as Erik pointed out, we're really looking at how those stores help to drive our sales in every given market. While there may be opportunities to close underperforming stores, that's not really part of our strategy. We don't have a closure strategy. We have a market share strategy.","So, as we look at any given market, there might be an opportunity to move from a C location to an A location, as an example. There might be opportunities to look at the numbers of stores we have in a given market. But what we're not going to look at is just simply the four-wall economics of that store. We're going to look at how good of a job we're doing using and leveraging those stores to drive the overall market (18:01) sales. Do you want to take the Rack one?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","You bet. This is Blake, and I just would add before I talk about the Rack. In addition to that footprint, I've mentioned that we're opening in Sherway in Toronto. We've got two relocations. We've got Manhattan coming up, and there are one or two other tentative ones. We're not looking at other store locations within full-line stores outside of what Jamie said in terms of enhancing what we have or maybe a relocation. We think we have the right footprint to best serve the country, so we're pleased with our store locations.","In terms of the Rack, we ended last year with 215 stores. We've talked about in the past that we could, over time, have approximately 300. I think the important thing there, too, is also the digital side of it. We ended last year with Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook with $700 million in sales. I made reference in my comments that this is the fastest growing part of our business in the history of this company moving towards $1 billion. So we're particularly excited, from an off-price point of view, of what's possible in digital. Very similar to what's happening in full-price.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","And this is Pete. I'll take the part about the fashion cycle. I think the themes that are generally true across all classifications is that there's a continuing trend around casualization that we need to be mindful of really kind of across the board. And that we've had good success I think, where we've focused on that appropriately. Newness is always a theme that we talk about and for us to have our inventories in line and be able to bring new goods in always helps stimulate the business. Also, athletic and fitness type brands, and that's kind of part of that casualization lifestyle part that we talked about a bit over the years, that's a strong trend.","As I look at our top brands, it's interesting. We have several that are super healthy and growing double digits, then we have some big legacy brands we've done business with that are not, that are shrinking quite precipitously. So I guess that's always been true to a degree, but the good news for us is that with how some of the brands are falling off, it creates open-to-buy for us. And so if you look at it from the buyer's point of view and our whole merchandising team, I think they feel pretty energized about the opportunity to go out and either apply more resources to some of these positive trends or find new brands. So I think generally our team feels \u2013 maybe it's the nature of our business, but feels kind of optimistic about the future and our ability to be able to find great product.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Could we go back to the gross margin line for a second? Just curious on the merch margin specifically. What did full-price look like year-over-year just relative to itself? Same question for Rack. And I'm just curious if you can provide any more detail about what happened in 1Q at Rack. Was there any change in terms of the percentage of inventory that it was taking from full-price? Did that have any impact on anything? If you could add any color there, that'd be great. Thanks.","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","Okay. This is Jim. On the margin side, I think you have to remember last year first quarter sales were pretty tough, and we were a little bit out of line with our inventories and we talked about that last year. And so we did see improvement in the full-price margins, just by virtue of the tougher comparison. I think the back half of this year will be more normalized, because, if you recall, last year in the back half we did a nice job and we're still holding inventories pretty well. On the off-price side, I think Blake's comments covered it. I think there were some pockets of goods that we had to take markdowns on. But I don't know that there's anything broad that we're seeing that concerns us.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, there's one other thing on the off-price, which I think speaks to the dynamic of how the multiple channels work together. So we've had such great growth in the online part of our off-price business. The resulting action of that, kind of the unintended consequence, it creates more returns into a physical Rack store. Stuff that someone had bought online, customers often choose \u2013 actually most often choose to want to return that in store.","So, we've got more inventory back into the store than we had originally planned, and that's, again, because of the large growth that we've had there on the online part of the business and our off-price part of the segment. So we can adjust to that as it goes forward, but we're playing catch-up on that a little bit. And I think we understand the further along that we get, how to anticipate those inventory conditions, and so that we can do it more efficiently.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. Can you quantify the increase in full-price merch margin and the decrease in Rack?","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","No, we don't go into that level of detail, but our expectations are unchanged for the year.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you share your view of where you'd expect the promotional levels across the channel to head going forward? Maybe any thoughts on the brand health and approach vendors are taking to their own inventories across the channel? And then I know you talk about the third of Rack customers that shop full-price. How large is the demographic differential between the non-overlapping shoppers? And would you expect that one-third number to grow over time as off-price continues to gain prominence? Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hi. This is Erik. I'll certainly take the first one. The promo level, we saw a reduction in promo level for us, which was mainly two factors. One is fewer promo events that we had to match. And the second being, of those events, more and more of the product we carry is on the exclusion list of our competitors, so for us that's a good thing.","As far as the second question was, the Rack customers that migrate over to full price, we have \u2013 a lot of that is \u2013 for us opportunity there is in data. As our models become more diverse, as off-price has become a bigger chunk of our business, as online becomes a bigger chunk of our business, we have more ways to serve the customer and gets us out of being an almost \u2013 predominantly, as our history has been, a mall-based physical store model. And one of the great aspects of that is around customer acquisition and customer data. The Rack is a tremendous place for us to acquire customers.","We're very early innings of capturing the customer information and leveraging that to serve customers better. Our launch last year of our loyalty program to include non-cardholders was a big step in the right direction. But we have a lot of opportunity going forward to continue to leverage customer information better, and that migration that you bring up is one of the benefits we would see from that.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Pete. The only other thing I would add to that is the customers between the Rack and the full-price, they look very similar in terms of their household incomes and what have you. Where they tend to differ, the least of which you can quantify on paper, is they're younger. So we work pretty hard to try to find a way that the off-price part of what we do and on-price part complement each other, and you can see with the way that physically where we put stores.","The most successful Racks are ones that are right next to a full-price store. So there is some synergy that goes with that. It doesn't necessarily cannibalize. There is share. There is acquisition that happens. But, again, generally there are some younger people that enter our brand through the Rack and that they end up migrating up to full-price over time. It's a good thing.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Next is Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess my question is on the retail EBIT dollar guidance. The range of $780 million to $840 million, could you just talk about what's assumed from a comp perspective at the high end versus the low end of that range? And then just staying with EBIT dollar trends, I know last quarter you talked about brick-and-mortar margins dipping below that of e-comm margins. Is that relationship still through in this quarter? And then longer term, how do you think about working to improve the brick-and-mortar margins, if we stay in this kind of sluggish top-line environment? Thanks.","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","So this is Jim. I'll take the first. I think, from a sales perspective, we guided flat comps for the year, total sales increase of 3% to 4%. So I think from how that plays out in terms of retail EBIT, we're right where we would expect to be in that zone, so really nothing to really talk about there. I think in terms of what you're seeing with the brick-and-mortar margins versus the online margins, I think Mike talked about it a little bit last quarter, is you've got a high fixed cost business, where sales are decelerating, and you've got a high variable cost business, where sales are accelerating, and so we're still dealing with that phenomenon as more sales are shifting to online. And so that would play out with EBIT margins as well. I don't think anything has changed in the first quarter from where we were or where we expect it to be.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","(27:58)","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah. I would just add. Again, going forward, we split out for these reporting reasons our online and store business, but we really don't use it much internally, because it's \u2013 increasingly the unlocks in our model is from \u2013 by looking across our businesses and looking at the business as through our two brands. So we have the Nordstrom brand and we have Nordstrom Rack brand. So you think about things like filling the top of the funnel. How do we get more engagement with our brand? That could be a marketing lens through our online business of, say, affiliates or banner ads or search words. But it can also be our salespeople in our stores of getting them engaged with our digital tools we have, and we need to look at those levers equally and not miss opportunities by putting our businesses in silos.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess two questions on the tech side. I guess, one, on the tech spending you've done the last couple of years, can you maybe talk about some of the e-comm functionality that you've added in the more recent time that you think could be the most impactful on the business? And then, secondarily, as you guys are already investors in Bonobos, I was just curious, it sounds like Walmart is going to buy them. So I was curious, on your growth initiatives between Trunk Club or HauteLook, are you guys out of the market to look for additional e-commerce acquisition vehicles?","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Erik, I'll take that, and you can chime in on the second one in particular. But our e-commerce functionality, for the first quarter, in general, I think you've heard us talk about it for a while now. We had addressed the underlying architecture to our website and modernized that, and that's different parts of our website have come online as being modernized at different times. We're about 80% modernized right now is our websites. We're not all the way there. But as we're able to modernize portions of our site, we're able to greatly, greatly enhance the speed with which we're able to roll out functionality and features to our customers.","In the last quarter, both our homepage and content pages became fully modernized and we were able to do a lot of A\/B testing on all sorts of features there. We had a number of enhancements in search and browse. We are right now in the process of launching a new My Account feature, which is a significant enhancement for \u2013 that's very visible to customers. That really allows customers to get a much cleaner, quicker view of their order history.","And the other part that I'd really call out that we're in the early innings of, but we did make measurable progress, is in our site performance, and that's not as sexy as a subject I'd talk about as customer features. But just the speed with which our site performs has improved measurably over the last quarter, and we are seeing measurable improvements in both conversion and sales from that.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","The last part of your question, you referenced Bonobos and industry discussion that Walmart's been speaking with them and may have a transaction with them. Your question was geared in towards our strategy of the investments that we may or may not make. Our strategy is based in the customer and trying to provide the capabilities and functionality that customer expects from us, and whether we can do that within our own team and resources, or it's helpful to partner with someone or, in some isolated cases, it might warrant an acquisition.","We're really sensitive of how we deploy the shareholders' capital along those lines. We're not predominantly very acquisitive, but we have done some things over the years and some partnerships that have been really helpful to improve that customer experience. We have had an investment with Bonobos, and we sell their product as well, and it sounds like there's some \u2013 maybe some exciting opportunities for them and we'll see how that plays out.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","I would just add on the Bonobos, we've had \u2013 some of our folks have had good relationships with the Jet.com folks, and have been in communication with them since that acquisition got announced. And we've \u2013 Bonobos experience has been good one for us. So what we're hearing is Jet.com bought them, not Walmart, and they're looking to keep those brands. So for right now, we don't see any change in our Bonobos relationship. And in general, I think there is an overarching trend for us of needing to be more externally aware and looking for more strategic partnerships, just as you've seen in all the limited distribution product that we've carried. We're \u2013 our world is changing fast, and so we're curious to what's going on that other companies are approaching the retail challenges, and if there's something to be learned out there and something that can help our business by partnering up, we're willing to do that.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. The name of your press release was that the first quarter was in line with expectations. I just wanted to circle back to the P&L and get your gauge. Was that inclusive specifically of the overall consolidated comps in line with your view, as well as gross margins? And then also just to follow-up on that, you have added some commentary to the guidance for considerations. And you specifically outlined that there are increased occupancy expenses along with higher fulfillment and technology costs. Could you just elaborate on how we should be thinking about that impact to the P&L? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Paul, this is Blake. What we were trying to convey in that release is that the earnings were in line with our expectations, but the top line wasn't. And I tried to make that clear in my comments as well. So I want to be really clear about that. So we fell short of our expectations from a top-line, a very consistent trend we had last year. So we continue to deal with, in a businesslike way, that. But we are making good progress with the bottom-line results in the financial model, and there's more to do and we're encouraged by that. We have a lot of initiatives that give us cautious optimism for the balance of this year. And, again, we try to be clear that there's no change in our annual guidance. Some of the reporting that you referred to is we're just trying to give some clarity about the nuances for the year and the quarter, because we don't give quarterly guidance, and that was the thought behind that.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. Blake, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on categories. We heard from one of your peers today that the margins in the cosmetics business are under a little bit of pressure. I'm wondering if you're seeing either any pressure on sales in the category or margins in that category. And then if you could comment on handbags, how they performed in the quarter, and shoes as well, that would be very helpful. Thank you so much.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hi. This is Pete. I will take those questions. With regards to the beauty business, it's not dissimilar from what I mentioned earlier. We have some brands that have grown extremely well, but we also have some large legacy type brands that have been off for us. But where we've had our best success in beauty is in the limited distribution brands, the more prestige kinds of brands, we've had big growth there. It's given us a lot of confidence on how we can invest going forward.","With regards to the gross margins specifically, we don't really have anything to report about that. There's nothing demonstrably that we can think of there. Then you wanted to know about handbags and shoes, is that correct?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","I think that's correct.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","So handbags, the strongest part of our handbag business, and this has been going on for a while, is the designer part. That has continued to be very healthy. There are some large brands, again, that participate at a lower price point than designer that have been big businesses that have been challenged. And so we're \u2013 it's created some open-to-buy for us to try some new things. So we've got some catch-up to play there. So, in total on handbags, including everything, it's down more than the average would be of everything else we're doing.","Shoes, it's a big business for us. So we'd have to go speak to something pretty specific. Generally, again, the designer part of our shoe business has been strong. The part that's been the weakest for us is our BP. Shoes department in Women's, which generally represents more of an entry kind of price point, typically a little bit younger and more casual in styling. We've got to dig into that a little bit more and find out. I don't think that's necessarily reflective exactly of what's going on in the industry, because you already heard me say earlier that things like athletic and casualization has done well. So I think that really is mostly on us and stuff that we can fix and solve for, so that doesn't seem to be a secular issue that we can't solve for. But generally, our shoe business continues to be very healthy.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. It sounds like you're making a lot of progress on the exclusive product mix. Can you share any metrics around the percentage of products that is exclusive to you, and also maybe trends in customer price matching?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, this is Pete. We don't really measure it so much in terms of exact percentage of business that we have. It's a little bit difficult to do that. So we don't have that number. I can tell you that it's growing, though. We've been able to identify opportunities with a lot of vendors that are anxious to try to grow a full-price business, and I think they like our capabilities in terms of omni-channel that we present to them. So increasingly, we have more kind of limited distribution product with important vendors. So that's working well. I'm sorry, what's the second part of your question?","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Any trends in customer price matching, are you seeing that come down as the industry gets a little less promotional?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, it's a little less promotional, but the part that is \u2013 I think that we should be aware of, it's a little misleading that we don't quantify quite as much is just because they've moved from a literal markdown of everything, some of our competitors do a buy more, save more program. While that's something we don't match, when those things are going on, it impacts our business, and more online than it does in a store. That customer is kind of searching through based on price in the comfort of their home or on their phone or what have you. That'll be a determining factor on how they buy things. So there still is a promotional environment out there. It's just how it's done exactly has changed a little bit. And again, we don't compete as directly with that, but we do feel some of the ill effects of it.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And, Pete, you talked about how, again, this more limited distribution is outside of some of that more promotional environment. So the actual cadence of the promotional environment at our competition might still be the same, but the content of the inventory is evolving and changing and creating less exposure for us, and we think it's reflective in the full-price business improving as well.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. You've been real leaders in the customer-centricity and the question I have is, as customers expect so much, what do you think about the overall margin profile of the business and the need to materially step margins down, just as you see the variable costs rise and also as you look across at competitors who function in a very different margin structure? And it just feels like the speed to which customers expect product and the convenience factors will continue to pressure the need for you to address what consumers need.","So I'm curious about the multiyear perspective on that since you are at the cutting-edge with a lot of programs that you're implementing. And then I didn't know if I understood; so your lowest productivity full-line stores, like should those be closed, or do you feel like they're brand-appropriate even though they're four-wall profitable? Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Erik. In terms of the margin impacts of more speed and convenience, there is a whole list of win-win initiatives for us; wins for the customer that are also wins for our business. And you said we're on the cutting-edge; I don't know about that. What we focus on is, what are the assets we have that we can bring to bear to serve customers better. And one of the assets we, obviously, have is the 122 full-line stores to take care of our Nordstrom customers. And specifically, it's a place customers can go. It's also got people in there that can do things to serve customers better, and there's inventory. We've got a lot of inventory that's sitting out close to customers. So things like buy online and pick up in store is a great service. We have that in all our stores. It's growing about 50% year-over-year. And all our stores also have curbside pick up, if customers want it.","That's something that's a huge win for customers. It's also a win for us, for a customer to come in and pick up in the store. So we're focused on what are the assets we can have before we get into kind of the race to the bottom of what are the things that just cost more. There is some of that, but boy, we see an enormous amount of opportunity to do things that bolster the customer better and serve our business better.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Oliver, I'll take the second one. In terms of our smaller stores, when we look at those stores, I think we have to ask ourselves, how would we feel about that store if we had to make a big investment in it? And given the amount of sales those stores drive in a given market, the answers are different. If it's a store that's the only store in a market, we have very measurable online sales that those stores drive, and so we look at that. It might be the fifth or sixth store in a market, and that will give us a different answer.","And if you look at what we've done over the last few years, where we have closed a number of stores that might have been the fifth or sixth store in that market and where we've invested in better locations in that market, we'd rather the customers shop there. So I understand the spirit of the question, and we look at that a lot. We think there will be some opportunities over time, but we really want to look at holistically with how we're serving customers in a given market, the role that those stores play, the role that online play and how we can best serve them long-term. And that will drive our decisions around our store fleet.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on the model really quickly. The other revenue line slowed quite a bit in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just point us to what was moving in now, and I know it's a small revenue line, but it was a little bit of a different move than we thought.","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, you're talking about in the table towards the back of the earnings release?","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","The $126 million and the other line I think includes...","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes. Okay.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Trunk Club, Canada, yeah.","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, that's Trunk Club and Canada. I would just \u2013 I don't think there's anything unusual there from our expectations again. Everything was pretty much as we expected, and there's nothing in that line I would point out.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. You mentioned that sales were maybe a little bit off from what you thought, but you did say your expectation at this point the Rack comps can accelerate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more color there. I wanted to \u2013 obviously, there's a little bit of noise in there with some more promotions and lower sales. But is there something you're tweaking or would you tell me just go do some math on why the Rack comps will accelerate, or is there something strategically you're tweaking or an inventory opportunity that led to that comment?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Blake. In all of our businesses we've got a number of initiatives that we're working on, and they're rolling out throughout the year. I would tell you that we planned the Rack business for the trend that's been the last, let's say, 18 months, and that's approximately flat in the comps in the stores. For Q1, we missed it by 0.9%. We're confident that we can get back on top of that, meet that plan, and hopefully exceed it for the balance of the year.","So we think we have grounded plans in trend that enable us to be more agile and flexible, to move forward as the business responds. What's happened in years past is that we tend to get optimistic that tomorrow's going to be better, and we get over our SKUs on expense or inventory. And it doesn't allow us to be fluid and react to the business.","So, as Pete said, the whole subject about newness and a reason why the customer should buy something new really gets grounded in our merchants' ability to be able to keep that routine very open and fluid. And so we have that with the Rack. Our inventories are in line and I think we have some good initiatives this year. But we look at the Rack not just \u2013 and it's been said throughout this call, from the bricks and mortar point of view. We look at it as an off-price business with \u2013 in our Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. And when you put that together, we think we're gaining market share, and we have facts that show that, but we're falling short of our plan.","So we're trying to be clear with all of you on this call that we're not satisfied with these top-line numbers, and we're working hard on that. And we believe that we can make some progress on that. And we have to show you that through the facts each quarter as the year plays out.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","If I could add one last one.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, good. I'd like to ask one last one, if it's okay.","James A. Howell - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hey, Michael, that's fine.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","So the full-line stores down 6.4% on the comp. As we sat here today and listened to some traffic numbers from some of your competitors that are \u2013 that have a lot more exposure being at C malls that are \u2013 the traffic levels are, obviously, fairly sobering across the space right now. But we've always looked at you guys and your full-line stores as a proxy for the A malls more across the country. And some of the numbers that we see come by through external data sources through the quarter suggests that traffic shouldn't be quite as bad in the A malls. And I wanted to just get your thoughts on how \u2013 I know you guys don't speak about ASPs or AURs in the month, but what do you think you need in the full price stores at this point to say we can really get \u2013 we can make a shot at getting these traffic numbers up in these stores if maybe there's some AUR pressure that continues in the industry?","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. This is Jamie. We look at \u2013 we don't have great traffic numbers. We see a lot of the same numbers that you do. We look at transactions as a proxy for traffic, and it's been down. And the trends around that have been really consistent for the last year-plus, and so we do think that there are less visits to the mall. What we see, though, is that lot of those visits are now going to our website. People shop for things lots of different ways, depending on what their need state happens to be that day. Some of those trips in the past have converted to trips to Nordstrom.com, and we're thrilled about that. And so it's our job to continue to focus on investing in our business and the experiences we can provide customers across all the channels to make for a great shopping experience. And if that means they replace what used to be a trip to the mall with a trip to our website, it's our job to serve them well and our entire team is focused on doing that all the time.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom.

I'd like to mention that we'll be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section.

Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry as it includes brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our customers look forward to our Anniversary Sale every year, and its one-of-a-kind element attracts new customers as well.","This is our biggest event, consistently generating significant volume that rivals the holiday period. Our Anniversary results outperformed our recent sales trends as customers responded favorably to newness and the ability to shop the way they prefer, in stores, with a mobile device and online.","Our event continues to generate a strong call to action for our customers, and we increasingly see a higher penetration of digital sales. We delivered online growth of more than 20% compared to last year's sale. We also grew Buy Online, Pick Up in Store sales by roughly 50%.","Our results demonstrated our progress in offering customers a differentiated selection of the best brands and products. In addition to a strong sell-through rate of our Anniversary product, we had increases in our regular price sales over last year. Beauty and Women's Apparel led our results, and three of our Nordstrom proprietary labels were among our top five selling brands.","Our Nordstrom cardholders, who are among our most loyal customers, highly value the rewards benefit of shopping the sale early. Unfortunately, we had some website performance issues on the first day of early access. Our teams responded and resolved these issues within hours. Because our customers are our top priority, we subsequently offered Nordstrom cardholders 10 points per dollar spent on purchases made during the start of early access. Our customers appreciated this approach, and we saw a substantial recovery in sales throughout the remainder of the day. In fact, we had the biggest day of online volume in our company's history.","Turning now to our overall sales results, we ended the second quarter with a total sales increase of 3.5% and comp increase of 1.7%. This growth was driven by our digital businesses with Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook up 27% and Nordstrom.com up 20%.","In our full-price business, the Anniversary Sale contributed to positive gains with total sales increasing 2.4% and comp sales increasing 1.4% in the second quarter. While our full-line stores improved during the sale, the underlying trends outside of this event were consistent with our recent trends.","Keep in mind that our Anniversary results won't necessarily inform our second half performance. Recall that last year, after a strong Anniversary Sale, our second half was more reflective of the trends prior to the event.","In our off-price business, total sales increased 9.8%, and comp sales increased 3.1%. This represented an improvement of roughly 100 basis points from last quarter, but fell slightly below our expectation.","Looking to the rest of the year, we continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience and reaching new customers by leveraging our digital capabilities and investing in our top markets. As part of our customer strategy, we're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital shopping experiences.","We're expanding our Reserve Online & Try in Store service from six stores in the Seattle area to four more in the Chicago market. We plan to offer this feature in roughly 50 stores by the end of the year. We've been encouraged to find that around 80% of customers, who try this service, choose to shop this way again.","We're executing on our digital strategy to meet our ambition for continued double-digit online growth. Through our ongoing efforts to elevate the digital experience, we expect our online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year. We've modernized our platform, enabling us to increase the speed and agility of enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content.","In our efforts to gain market share, we continue to prioritize our investments in the top North American markets. In September, we'll complete our planned full-line store expansion into Canada with a sixth store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto, and in October, we will relocate two full-line stores in California, one from Westside Pavilion to Century City in Los Angeles and the other into a new space at University Town Center in La Jolla.","Our Rack business is an important way to attract new customers to Nordstrom. We opened six stores this spring with 11 more opening this fall, which will bring our total Rack store count to 232 at year end. These stores incorporate our latest store designs with improvements to the layout and fitting room experience.","Additionally, we're further integrating the digital and store functionalities to improve speed and convenience for the customer. For example, we enhanced our mobile app so that customers scan an item in store and buy it online if they want a different color or size.","Through strategic partnerships with our vendors, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness and relevant product. Our efforts to expand product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most relevant brands while strengthening our regular price business.","In closing, we view our business through our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands rather than through discrete store and online channels. The combination of our physical and digital assets represents a competitive advantage. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, product and services, are the core of our brand and play an important role in engaging with our customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began in our stores.","With our customers at the center of everything we do, we're appreciative of the ongoing efforts by our team to better serve them in more ways, which has contributed positively to our second quarter results.","I'd now like to introduce Anne Bramman, who joined our team as Chief Financial Officer on June 2. She is a tremendous addition to our executive team and the company as a whole and has hit the ground running in supporting our various initiatives.","Anne, I'll now turn it over to you.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. So, before we get started on our results, I'd like to say how excited I am to be part of this company. I've long admired the Nordstrom brand and the management team. Since being in the role for the last couple of months, my appreciation of the company's unique culture and customer-centric philosophy has only grown.","During a time of transformative change in the industry, I consider Nordstrom a leader in strategically investing for the future. In supporting the company's commitment to operating excellence, I am focusing on evolving our business model to better serve customers and improve our performance.","Moving on to our second quarter results, our earnings per share of $0.65 achieved our expectations. This reflected our positive Anniversary results, ongoing inventory and expense discipline and continued strength of our financial position.","Now, some additional color on the drivers of our earnings. Beginning with merchandise margins, we had an improvement over last year, driven by the strength of our regular price selling. This exemplifies our ongoing progress with finding customers with newness and limited distribution product. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position with sales growth of 3.5% outpacing inventory growth of 2.2%.","Our merchandise performance was more than offset by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores, in addition to the unplanned 10-point loyalty accommodation that Blake mentioned. We believe this offer contributed to our top line performance, but impacted gross profit by $7 million or 20 basis points.","From an EBIT perspective, we estimate the overall impact was roughly breakeven for the quarter, with potential future upside if customers redeem their points. The net impact of all these factors was a 25 basis point decline in gross profit from last year.","Moving to our expense performance, we've made meaningful improvement to our operating model. As we've accelerated our investment to fuel growth over the past several years, our technology, supply chain and marketing expenses grew 20% on an annualized basis from 2010 to 2015.","Last year, we made a significant step change by making a number of adjustments to increase our efficiencies. As a result, the expense growth of our enterprise capabilities was cut in half to 10%. Throughout this year, we continue to maintain this moderated expense rate for these areas.","For the second quarter, SG&A expense increased 5% from last year or approximately 45 basis points, driven by a couple of items. As we've shared at the beginning of the year, we planned a total technology investment on a cash basis of $540 million, or 3.5% of sales. This all-in view captures the changing nature of our investment as we continue to shift to a cloud-based platform. This transition resulted in an immediate expense impact rather than capitalization.","In the first half of the year, we stayed on track with our plan as we continued to focus on improving our technology productivity. In addition, there was a mix impact from higher supply chain costs associated with the growth of our online businesses, which accounted for 25% of our sales in the second quarter.","In terms of our underlying supply chain performance, on average, cost per unit came in better than planned. Our credit EBIT increased $23 million over last year, driven by a 30% increase in credit card revenues. This was attributable to our successful partnership with TD Bank, which continues to exceed our expectations.","Turning to our financial position, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, essentially flat to a year ago. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $574 million and free cash flow of $115 million.","Our debt leverage remained consistent with our expectations at 2.4 times on adjusted debt to EBITDAR basis. These metrics reflect our strong financial position, which is supported by a robust e-commerce platform and high quality store portfolio.","Even through this current retail environment, we've demonstrated industry-leading growth, increasing sales by 6% on an annualized basis over the past three years. Since 2009, we've consistently generated annual operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion, while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.","We are well-positioned in the market, with our stores generating positive cash flow. As Blake mentioned, we are disproportionately investing in the top markets in which we serve customers. Our omnichannel business model provides favorable economics related to the cost of serving customers and strengthening our brand. As we continue to refine our approach, we'll keep you updated on how we're aligning our metrics to better reflect the underlying performance of our business.","Turning now to our full year outlook, we've narrowed EPS to the high end of our range, which represents $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our second quarter performance, while holding our assumptions for the second half of the year. Our top line expectations are consistent and reflect the trends we've seen over the past 1.5 years. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 4%, including $200 million for the 53rd-week, while we expect comp sales to be roughly flat to last year.","Retail gross profit assumes higher new store occupancy expenses and the mix impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins for the year should be relatively stable. Our SG&A outlook remains consistent and incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives, offset by our continued progress in productivity improvements. Our second quarter income tax rate of roughly 42% was impacted by timing. We expect to end the year with a tax rate of approximately 40%.","In closing, we remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. This enable us to continue creating value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers and employees.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. And as a reminder, we will not be commenting on the June 8 announcement.","And we'll now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eddie Yruma with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Obviously, some really strong results in e-commerce. How much of that is due to kind of a desire for an Anniversary Sale customer to purchase something online because of out-of-stock in store versus what you would view as kind of an organic e-commerce growth rate? Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","I'll take it. This is Erik. Well, a couple of comments on it. Number one, we came out of the gate super strong online, so it wasn't that customers were going to stores and not finding their size and going to online. That being said, our online business has grown faster than our normal regular trends during Anniversary for the last several years.","Anniversary does seem to lend itself more and more to customers' desires on how to shop that event. And I think having real hot product at great price that is limited in quantity does for many customers, they prefer to search for those online. So it's been a continuation of a multiyear trend we've seen.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. It was interesting to hear how strong Beauty is, and it's one of the best performers in your full-price stores. What do you think you guys are doing differently than the rest of the department store sector in this space, which seems to be struggling and losing share to some of the newer channels out there? Your company seems to be doing quite well, which is unique in the space. Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hi. This is Pete. I'm not exactly sure what the other guys are doing, so it's hard for me to tell you. But I could tell you where we've had success, and I think that's just with the ongoing work that we do shoulder to shoulder with our key vendor partners, and we've got a really good team in Beauty that's been doing this for a while, and we've got good relationships there.","I think, particularly, when you look at more of the premium sector of that part of the business, we've demonstrated over several years that we have customers that they like. So we're able, I think, to work on programs that are unique to us and it's paid off great. And it happened the same way with the Anniversary Sale. So we've got a good thing going there, and we've had consistent strength in Beauty for a while.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Congratulations on the nice quarter. You'd indicated earlier in the year that you're expecting your e-commerce business to have a higher margin rate than your full-line stores. Could you provide us an update there?","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. This is Erik. We don't split that out precisely. So we're not going to share specific numbers on that, but I will say the EBIT performance of our online business is growing nicely.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great to hear. Could you provide some color on the shift away from the capitalized model for your software? What are the learnings as you implement these new structures and agreements with your technology providers?","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","So, I think part of what you're seeing is that we're still, we're modernizing our platform and it's allowing us to become very agile in making changes that are customer-facing. Clearly, we're not quite at that inflection point yet when we look at what's going through operating expense versus what's going through capitalization and depreciation. At some point in the future we expect that inflection point, but right now, we're kind of, so to speak, are seeing both pieces to it. But it is allowing us to become much more agile in how we deal with the customer-facing software.","Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you so much, and best of luck.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Blake, I think you mentioned that the performance for the quarter was driven by the Anniversary event. And underlying results, let's say, excluding the Anniversary Sale, showed no change from recent trends. So would we assume, outside of the Anniversary Sale, that would've \u2013 that the same-store sales result would've been, let's say, similar to the first quarter? And then secondarily, if you could just give us, if you have any color available and care to comment, any sort of range of performance from the Anniversary Sale event? That would be helpful.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Well, Kimberly, your first question would be correct; yes, separate of Anniversary, the overall business was in keepings with my comments with our trends of late. I'm sorry. I wasn't clear on your second question. One more time?","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I was wondering if you care to comment on the comp results during the Anniversary period, if they were positive mid-single digits or maybe even double digits?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","We don't break out those numbers, but, obviously, for the trend of the last year or two to be the way they are for us to have a positive full in-store event means that we had a good solid Anniversary Sale. So we don't break out those figures, but what we're trying to convey to you is that we're very pleased with our teams' efforts and most importantly, how the customer responded to our offering.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next is Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about off-price. This is, I think, the third quarter in a row where you've had some deceleration in the Rack stores. Just hoping you could update us on your thoughts there. It sounds like you've rolled out some tools that allow the customers to more seamlessly shop in Rack stores but buy online. So, curious if just the negative store comp is more the new normal? Or how you're thinking about the channel shift dynamics versus the broader competitive dynamics that may be pressuring the Rack store business? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Blake. I'll take that. In one of the slides, in my remarks, it shows both the full-price and off-price business, and if you look for the last six quarters, it's been fairly consistent, ranging from on the high 8% to about 11.8% to 12% from a total business and the comps are pretty similar. We had, in hindsight now, maybe, too aggressive of a plan for the year. So for this year, we've been running about 200 basis points below our plan, and that's put a little pressure on our business, and so that's why I made the comment that it was running a little bit below our expectations.","But the main thing that I've tried to convey in three or four of these calls now is both for the full-price business and the off-price business, we look at it as the customer looks at it, both digitally and in the stores. And so though, as merchants, we're aware of the nuances in each channel, the most important thing is how are we doing from a multichannel point of view in off-price. And we're really pleased with our results and we think there's a lot of positives taking place, whether that's attracting new customers, whether it's the productivity, the return on that investment, it's still a very strong part of our business and we're encouraged about the opportunities.","We have some opportunities with that plan to manage the inventory a little bit tighter. So overall, the company had good inventory control and off-price was slightly over given those plans, so it put a little margin pressure on it. But we think that's one of our strengths, we're making those changes and we hope to demonstrate that for you the balance of this year.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes, I would just like to add that even though we saw a little \u2013 it was a little bit below our plan for the year, we actually saw our merch margins grow year-over-year in off-price.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Hey. Thanks. Guys, wondering with your proprietary labels working so well during the Anniversary Sale, does it change how you think about the role that that part of the assortment can play for you guys in the future? Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes, this is Pete. I think it really fits with the narrative that we've been sharing around here for quite some time, is that when done right, the proprietary brands can be a real asset for us. And we've had a lot of good success over the years. So I think it's nice to have that play itself out. I think particularly as time goes on, it's pretty clear that we have to find ways to distinguish ourselves and our offer.","It's important that we have strong brands, but the brands aren't here to save us. That's not their job. So it's important that we can do what's within our control, and we've got a really strong team in terms of product development, and it's definitely part of our plans going forward that we'll find ways to leverage that and grow it.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","So should we expect that to increase as a percentage of the assortment as we look out to the second half or into next year?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Well, it takes a while for it to increase much, but I think it is true that it's planned to increase. But you don't see that in very short bursts. I mean, that kind of happens over time. But yes, part of our plan is to increase our own label penetration.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Okay. Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Brian Tunick with RBC.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was curious, maybe Anne could comment, you know, as you look at the investment impact on the P&L from I guess Trunk Club or the new stores in Canada and pre-opening in New York City and HauteLook, can you maybe talk about are there opportunities to find additional ways to stem those losses? Anything you bring from your prior companies? And then secondarily, can you maybe talk about where the leverage point is for sales on occupancy in the model going forward? Thanks very much.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for your question. So I think it's really important to have that balance of not only investing in our key markets and leveraging both our digital and our physical assets but also finding that right blend, and that right prioritization between serving the customer and the way they want to shop us as well as driving productivity.","So we're continuing to focus on both. There's sometimes some trade-offs along the way, but it's certainly a focus as far as \u2013 from a business model perspective as far as following the customer but also making sure we're being as productive as possible in order to help our business model. So it's not a short-term, like I say, it's not a sprint, it's a marathon and it's not a short-term fix. It's something that you continue to evolve.","And as far as the inflection point, we do have some things coming online and we've talked about that as far as the generational investments. We would expect to see that flow through especially with some of these large generational investments coming online in the future, but we're not giving guidance beyond this year.","Operator","Next is Dylan Carden with William Blair.","Dylan Carden - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi. Just on the higher merch margin, can you speak to the promotional environment and particularly what you're seeing on price matching out there?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes, this is Pete. Our percentage of promotional business is down a little bit from previous years, but a lot of that is not so much what's happening out there in the industry, because I think it's been pretty consistent with the promotional activity, but it's our efforts, whether it's through our own label or some of these brands that we've been partnering with to try to find a way to insulate ourselves from some of that.","As we talk about pretty much every single quarter, I mean, what really drives our business is newness and regular price flow. And even if you looked at an Anniversary Sale, we did well with Anniversary product, but we did particularly well with regular price product and sale too. So it's just an ongoing effort for us to be able to collaborate in ways that ensures full-price business.","Dylan Carden - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. Can you discuss your online return rates and the trends there, and whether you see those returns mostly coming back to the fulfillment center or do they result in store visits? And if so, how can you recapture kind of the incremental sales when they come back? Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure, Adrienne. This is Erik. Our online return rate, we don't break out specifically. It's come down a bit in the last \u2013 it's been over a year now that we've made some progress there. But it's high. Our online business' a high return rate. We get over \u2013 for full-price, over 60% of our online purchase returns do come to stores. For off-price, it's over 80%, which is a real positive for us. It's an example we use a lot internally, especially on full-price, because it is free for customers to mail back their returns, yet over 60% of our customers choose to do their returns in a store. And it's because that's what they want to do. It's good for the customer, and by the way, it's good for us. It's more economical for us to take a return that way, and also, as you can imagine, having a customer in the store is beneficial.","And we really don't focus on trying to turn around that return and make it fail immediately with it. What we've learned is a customer comes with a return, that's their errand they have to do, and the more efficient, the faster we are in doing that, the more free time we're giving back to the customer. And oftentimes, they take that free time and start shopping. So we're really looking to take care of the customer on their terms, and if they have a great experience in our store with a return, we certainly believe that ends up in good news for us.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about \u2013 Blake, I think you said, we think about these, rather than stores and online, as omnichannel brands. So in that context, are you guys generally comfortable with the idea that store comps could be sort of declining ongoing? And if that's the case, how do you think about managing investments into the store fleet? And also, you talked about some really big, bold online initiatives to drive digital. What do you consider your biggest store-facing initiatives to drive productivity there? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","So, Lindsay, this is Blake. I'll take part of that, and then I might at the end on what's happening in the full-line stores' productivity have Jamie comment a little bit about that. But yes, your opening comment, we do look at it in total like that, and we're mindful of, as Anne talked about earlier, how we're deploying the shareholders' capital. And it needs to be balanced in stores and digitally, and our board works closely with us on that.","And that's a very fluid subject. You can't starve the stores. You need to maintain them. And so we have a fleet of 123 stores, and we think we're in good locations. All of our stores contribute and are profitable. And so when we think about that investment, it's gone from a very democratic approach to all stores being the same to being more strategic and targeted.","And so as we think about from a DMA (31:00) point of view, the top markets are getting more of those funds and we think that's appropriate. And then we think balanced with the digital offering, that's how the customer is shopping. So where we have success is looking at it by the customer, by the community, by the market, how they want to shop, whether it's online or in store and it's up to us to make sure we're deploying those resources, talent and capital appropriately. In terms of some of the things we're doing in the store, I think maybe, Jamie, you could give a couple of examples there.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. I think a lot of it falls under the umbrella of further integrating the store and digital experience. We've been talking for a while now about our store reserve launch, which I think just this week, we've rolled out to \u2013 we're now in 50 stores across the company. That's purely a mobile experience for customers. It can only be done through the app on our phone.","And it's really, really encouraging, mostly because about 80% of the customers who try it do it again. The repeat rate is really high, which means customers like it. Customers like having more ability to shop on their terms. The store plays a huge role in that, and they're really important. And they're going to be the hub of a lot of the things that we do over time, which is why we want to continue investing in our most important markets.","But a lot of the advancements in our service is going to be the things that we allow customers to do mostly via their phones to be able to shop those stores in a more efficient and in a more, frankly, enjoyable manner, which we believe is the best service. Our focus is on improving service, and this is one of the chief ways that we're going to be delivering on that in years to come.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Miles Rocklankum (33:01) with Cowen.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thanks for taking our question. Can you update us on handbags? How did this category perform during the quarter? And what are your expectations for back half of the year? Thank you.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes, this is Pete. Handbags for us has improved some. And particularly look over the last \u2013 is it year and a half, where it's had some challenges. We've made good progress there, and the momentum is going the right way. And, in particular, the strongest part of our handbag has been the designer part of it. And so, I think, we're on a good track there, and we anticipate that that will continue to improve. There's a little bit of a cycle to these things, but we do have some pocket of success and I think we're investing in the right ways going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Kevin Patrick Heenan - Guggenheim Partners Investment Management LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob. I was just wondering if you could comment on how the active segment performed in the quarter, and sort of any margin or discounting trends to be mindful of (34:15) in particular? Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Pete again. The active part of our business is very good, and that's been that way for a while, as well. I mean, it's not unique, because I think that's just in terms of the sensibility of how people shop, the casualization of America and how active is really a driving force in fashion and trend. It's a big part of it, so that's been really good.","There is some promotional activity, but we do a big business, for example, with our ZOE label in women's active. It's a big part of it, and that's proprietary label and we don't have price conversion pressure there, so that's really helpful. I think it's a foundational brand.","On the sales, in particular, it was very successful, very successful, we're very pleased with that. And then, back to the things I've said earlier, even with the big brands that you may find in other places, we're finding ways to differentiate ourselves through the offer, and we've got good relationships there. So, yes, there's some promotional pressure, but I think we're moving in the right direction.","Kevin Patrick Heenan - Guggenheim Partners Investment Management LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Next is Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So at brick and mortar, outside of the Anniversary Sale, was it traffic or was it average unit retail that you saw continuing to impact the comp? And then, just larger picture, as you think about the competition online in apparel and some new players, what do you see is separating the Nordstrom experience today and any changes to think about?","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","I'll take the first part of that. This is Jamie. It's because of traffic. We actually don't measure traffic. We use transactions as a proxy for traffic. And it was slightly improved in the second quarter relative to the trend over the last few quarters, which is to say roughly in line with our comp sales, and probably pretty aligned with what we all see in terms of the reported mall traffic numbers that are out there. So a slight improvement, but nothing real material.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Erik. I'll take the online question. What we're focused on, which we've talked about for the last number of quarters, a couple parallel paths we need to go down. One is around taking friction out and being convenient in a more transactional way. Having our site perform faster, page load, how many clicks to check out, those things, and a lot of that goes to the underlying architecture of our site. We've been investing to modernize our site. It's almost completely modernized.","The other part that enables, which is the other path we have to go down is differentiating our online experience, which, for us, we think the right place is, in addition to being a convenient friction-free transaction, is for it to be a richer experience, a place for discovery. As Pete talked about, long been the driver of our business has been newness and we think we should have the fashion authority, the curated assortment with customers to be a place where they come for something new and update their wardrobes.","We've been investing, as you know, for quite some time and some of those investments are starting to mature and some are in early stages. But I'd point out around technology data where we're investing in particular around supply chain, marketing and personalization. And we're starting to see progress in all those areas and Anniversary was part of that. And supply chain, there's a reference that our cost per unit delivering was reduced year-over-year, but just from a customer experience, we delivered package faster at a lower cost this Anniversary while also reducing the number of orders that were canceled due to inventory latency in the system. So there has been good progress there that we think is really important to customers.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. I was hoping to get an update on the New York stores. Any change to the timing of openings? And then where are we on both expense and capital outlay for the group of stores?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hi. This is Pete. Regarding the timing of our opening in New York, we are on track. It's what we've been talking about for a while. So we're opening in March of 2018, our Men's store. We're opening up in fall of 2019 the main tower, which will house Women's. That is on track.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","And as far as the investment, I think we gave guidance that there was a ramp up this year of around $30 million. We're still on track with that for this year as well.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the Rack and also the full-line, what did you see in terms of traffic trends, full-price versus the Rack? And with some new assortments coming in the Rack like the MAC Cosmetics, what else should we be looking forward to as you expand the assortment there? Thank you.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Well, Dana, hi. This is Blake. I'll start with that. You're very astute. You've been out in our stores and have seen the MAC in there...","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yes.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","...and it's just a great example of a terrific vendor partnership. And they had a unique opportunity, and our team was able to partner with MAC here not too long ago. And obviously, it's been really well received by the customer.","That is the nature of that business, is being able to be opportunistic, to work with our key vendors and to be able to take advantage of things like that, and obviously we want to keep doing more of things along those lines. It's why we're very sensitive to the inventory management because it's really important in that business, even maybe more so than the full price business, that we're opportunistic in our buys and that we have open to buy and can be aggressive in that. To date, I can't think of something material we've had to pass on, but we just want to stay in that mode.","In terms of foot traffic between the stores, Jamie talked earlier, we don't have traffic counters. We look at transactions. We are seeing \u2013 continues to be a very healthy movement of customers between the channels. And in many cases their first experience is in the Rack and in off-price and online, and they migrate into a full-price offering. And it's a great way for us to attract an aspirational customer that we're anxious to have part of our portfolio.","So I don't know, Jamie, was there anything you would add on full-price?","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes. You heard what I said earlier about full-price traffic. One way to think about it, and certainly the way we think about it, is that our most profitable customers shop in multiple channels. And the better job we do for our customers in the Rack store, the more loyal they are to us across our entire fleet.","So our ability to have flow of new product in those stores is directly commensurate with the smiles on people's faces when they're walking out of those stores. If we do a good job of that, we start seeing them in our full-line stores pretty soon. And so we've got a long track record of seeing that work, and our entire team's really focused on doing that in the future.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next is Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess my question for you guys is on your loyalty comment that you made. 56% of your sales are now made up from loyalty members in the second quarter. That's up pretty substantially from last year and from the first quarter. So I'm curious now that you've lapped the broadening of your loyalty rewards criterion, how much more room do you see to run on this metric? And then, Anne, just if I can on the retail SG&A, because that's I think $60 million-ish year-over-year, a little bit higher than the trailing average of like $30 million. Just what's driving that? Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Well, I'll take the first one. You're right. We've anniversaried our non-tender launch from last year. Our Fashion Rewards program continues to be very important to us and show a lot of strength. We're encouraged that the addition of the non-tender portion of the loyalty program did not erode our tender base. Our tender base has stayed very flat there, and we've been able to add 5 million new net members to the non-tender part.","So we think there is more growth there. The onus is on us to put value into the program. It's not something to set up and then forget about it. We've got to continue to find ways to make it compelling for customers. And there's a number of ideas that we think are worth exploring. And again, I would say we should grow that.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","As far as your question on SG&A, if you go back to the opening comments that I had, there were really two big drivers of that. First is the fact that our technology spend is in line with our plan on cash, but the mix between what's capitalized versus what's going through the operating expense has shifted. That's driven a little bit of an increase year-over-year. And then the other big piece of it is the fact that we have higher penetration of online, which drove our supply chain costs.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Next is Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hi. Thanks. Could you guys touch on the complexion of gross profit margins going forward in light of the, you moving towards more full-price selling along with more proprietary labels? And could you remind us the penetration of both of those in the most recent quarter? Thanks.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes. So I'll just give you some broad commentary on gross margin, and we've laid out in the guidance for the year that we really believe this to be pretty comparable or pretty stable throughout the year. I think if you think about, we're exiting the quarter with a very good inventory position and we're continuing to be very disciplined on that going forward in the second half. When you think about gross margin in general, just keep in mind that the higher mix of off-price does impact the overall margins.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Great.

We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section.","Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President; and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's fourth quarter performance and the outlook for fiscal year 2017. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. With customer expectations changing faster than ever, it's important that we remain focused on the customer. Our strong financial position has enabled us to make significant investments over the past five years. Through these investments, we've been able to strengthen our foundation and grow our business. And as we move forward, this gives us a platform for enhanced capabilities to better serve customers and increase market share.","While we're mindful of the ever-changing and challenging retail environment, it also presents us with many opportunities. Our focus in 2016 was to improve both the customer experience and our productivity. We've been pleased with our team's efforts to adjust our operating model to meet the changing needs of customers. These efforts, particularly around inventory management and operating efficiencies, have contributed positively to our results.","Our fourth quarter comp sales decreased 0.9%. While this was consistent with recent trends, it was below our plan, particularly for our full-line store business. Early in the year, our team took aggressive steps to realign inventory in response to changes in customer demand. As a result of these efforts, fourth quarter sales growth outpaced inventory growth by nearly 500 basis points. This enabled the flow of newness and resulted in fewer markdowns, which contributed to our gross profit increase of more than 100 basis points.","For our Nordstrom brand, inclusive of our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, and Trunk Club, comp sales decreased 2.7%. While we are not satisfied with these results, it's worth noting that we continued to see a greater share of our business shifting to regular-price. Promotional sales in response to the competitive environment lessened relative to last year, demonstrating our momentum with growing relevant brands including limited distribution product.","For our Nordstrom Rack business, inclusive of online, comp sales increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter. For the year, our increase of 4.5% exceeded our plan.","As we look ahead, we are focused on speed, convenience, and personalization, culminating to our most important goal of improving service. We currently offer a number of ways to serve customers on their terms, wherever and however they shop.","As an example, we began offering buy online, pick-up in store back in 2008. To make this a more convenient experience, we added curbside delivery in all of our U.S. full-line stores and enhanced the overall experience. In 2016, we had an encouraging increase in buy online, pick-up in store sales volume of 45%.","In 2017, we are implementing several initiatives that are focused on our strategic pillars of product as well as service and experience. From a merchandising perspective, we strive to offer a curated selection of the best brands. This includes limited distribution names such as IVY PARK, J.Crew, Good American, as well as our Nordstrom exclusive brands. As we look for new opportunities through our vendor partnerships, we will continue to be purposeful in editing our assortment to facilitate newness and discovery.","In our full-price business, we completed a successful pilot of a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try on in our stores. Since the launch last fall in six Seattle area stores, we had over 10,000 customer reservations. Based on this strong response, we are planning to expand to 50 full-line stores this year.","We will also continue to enhance our digital selling tools to support new ways of serving customers seamlessly across all channels.","In our off-price business, we are further integrating the digital and store experience. For example, we recently added a feature in the mobile app that allows customers to scan an item and buy it online if the color or size is not available in the store. In addition, last October, we tested a new store design at the Rack with improvements to the store layout and fitting room experience. This format will be incorporated in most of our 17 new stores planned this year.","Looking over the longer-term, we know that changes in retail and customer expectations will continue at an accelerated pace. We have a high-quality store portfolio, which gives us an opportunity to fully leverage our local assets, our people, product and place, to solve customers' unmet needs.","In that regard, last month, we asked one of our top leaders, Geevy Thomas, to head up our efforts to re-imagine the customer experience. He brings over 30 years of experience in many areas of Nordstrom, including full-line stores, merchandising, and most recently at the Rack. He and his team will have the ability to move quickly and boldly to find and test new solutions for serving customers into the future.","In closing, we have good momentum in place and we will continue to make changes to ensure we are best serving customers and improving our business now and into the future.","I'd like to now turn it over to Mike to give additional color on our current performance and outlook for 2017.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Blake. Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model.","Throughout the year, we took aggressive actions to prioritize our resources and optimize inventory turns. These efforts have translated into stabilized retail operating margins over the past three quarters combined. We also generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the year, well surpassing our five-year historical average of $1.2 billion when excluding the sale of our credit card portfolio. This reflected working capital improvements largely driven by a 2.5% reduction in inventory.","We also delivered free cash flow of $550 million for the year, which also benefited from a 20% reduction in CapEx from last year.","Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, reflecting continued momentum in our inventory and expense execution. As Blake mentioned, our gross profit expansion of over 100 basis points had a meaningful positive impact on earnings. This reflects our strategies around product differentiation, which includes our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands and private label. We believe that over the long run, these strategies support a sustainable regular-price selling business which mitigates the impact of promotional activity in the marketplace.","We are encouraged that even through this current environment, we achieved record sales of $14.5 billion for the year. As we evolve with customers' changing expectations, we've made investments to fuel multiple growth areas.","Starting with our expansion into Canada, our five full-line stores, including two which opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 million in 2016. As we previously shared, we believe this market represents a $1 billion opportunity consisting of six full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores.","Second, our total online business reached over $3 billion, growing roughly 30% on an annualized basis since 2010.","Third, our off-price business reached $4.5 billion, and continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining around 6 million in 2016.","And finally, we had a strong customer response to our expanded loyalty program with 3.7 million customers joining through our non-tender offer. We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of over 55% from last year.","Looking forward, I'd like to spend some time discussing the evolution of our business model. As we evolve with changing customer expectations, our business has shifted from a four-wall model to one that supports multiple channels. This reflected significant investments to fuel growth over the past five years in both e-commerce and new markets. E-commerce now represents nearly one-quarter of our business compared to 8% in 2010.","While we improved profitability in our core business during this time, this accelerated shift to e-commerce has impacted our overall profitability. This dynamic requires us to make fundamental changes in the way we operate.","In 2016, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around technology, supply chain, and marketing capabilities. Over the past five years, spending in these areas grew by 20% on average. In 2016, we were able to bend that trajectory, cutting the growth in half. This is just the beginning of our progress.","As we head into 2017 and beyond, we will continue our efforts to reshape our business model to support long-term profitable growth.","The other element impacting our near-term profitability is our investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, Canada, and Trunk Club. We are beginning to realize benefits from these investments.","In 2016, they collectively contributed $1.2 billion to our top-line. Going forward, we expect improved operating performance as they begin to scale. In addition, 2017 includes pre-opening costs of roughly $30 million related to our Manhattan flagship store.","Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. Starting with the capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next five years. This is approximately 4% of sales, lower than the five-year historical average of 5%, due to moderating store investments.","With technology and supply chain as a key enabler of delivering customer experiences, roughly 40% of our plan is allocated towards modernizing our tech platform, delivering digital and mobile enhancements, and expanding our fulfillment network.","Also, as we shift to a cloud-based platform, the nature of our tech spending is transitioning from a build to a rent model. To get a holistic perspective on technology, we plan to incur in total a cash spend of roughly $540 million in 2017, or 3.5% of sales. While this is generally consistent with our run-rate over the past couple of years, our goal is to continually increase our productivity to support accelerated delivery of customer-facing features.","In 2016, we were able to roll-out features three to four times faster versus a couple years ago with further opportunity for improvement.","Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 financial outlook. We expect earnings per diluted share of $2.75 to $3.00, which incorporates total sales growth of 3% to 4% and flat comp sales. This assumes a continuation of negative trends in our full-line stores offset by outsized online growth.","Our outlook incorporates relatively stable gross margins while taking into account the negative mix impact from Rack's growth. As we head into 2017, we are in a clean inventory position with plans to maintain inventory growth in-line with sales trends. Additionally, our focus on product differentiation, which includes limited distribution brands and our private label, supports our ongoing efforts to strengthen our regular-price selling business.","From an SG&A rate perspective, our outlook includes continued technology and fulfillment investments supporting multi-channel growth in addition to incremental costs related to Manhattan. Please also refer to our slides for further assumptions regarding our outlook.","We're pleased with our progress in prioritizing resources, improving our productivity, and increasing our speed of execution. As we position our organization for future success, we still have work to do as we realign our resources and capabilities to better serve new and existing customers, consistent with their evolving expectation of the Nordstrom brand.","One more thing; as this is my last quarterly earnings call with Nordstrom, I'd like to thank both the research and investment community for their support and curiosity for our business. We have always strived to provide a differentiated experience for our customers, which also means evolving our business. The underlying value to both customers and shareholders is the brand that has been built by our customers and supported by company leadership. As customers' expectations continue to evolve, I'm very confident that the leadership and strategy will continue to elevate the Nordstrom brand.","Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started on Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We will now move to Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Mike, congrats on your last call, first off.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, so my question is on the flat same-store sales guide, anything for us to consider in terms of the front end versus the back half of the year? Just on the retail EBIT guide, it implies I think 80 basis points of contraction on a flat comp in terms of margin. If comps were to come in negative this year as opposed to that flat, just what level of expense flexibility do you guys have to hold, to hold margins?","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Well, Matt, let me take the first part of your question and that's the pace of sales over the year. While we don't give quarterly guidance, clearly, last year in the first quarter was pretty disappointing and that was a period of time when a lot of us change expectations for the year. So I would expect going up against softer numbers at the beginning of the year might be a little bit helpful. But generally speaking, there's no other material change other than that the Anniversary Sale will go back to its normal cadence between Q2 and Q3.","As far as the retail EBIT being down, I think that's a reflection of the soft business we continue to see in our full-line stores that's causing contraction there. Interestingly enough, in 2017, we're starting to see the profitability of the online business cross over to a higher margin than the store base business, and as that continues to scale, we expect to see improvement. In addition to that, there's the investments that continue to keep a little pressure on that. In terms of the impact of any other reduced sales, most of that comp sales reduction has been coming from the full-line stores, and clearly with the commission-based model, we tend to see some positive leverage that comes from that, and I think in addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to look for ways to readjust our operating model to make it more efficient.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Mike, best of luck and congratulations and thanks for everything over the years.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure, Bob. Thank you.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I guess just to follow Matt's question, around the full-line stores, when you look at the comp results in the full-line store, what are the biggest initiatives to manage the expense piece in that area of the business right now?","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hey, Bob, this is Jamie. I'll take that one. Our full-line stores for a long time have been really productive stores and our focus on productivity isn't changing. What is changing, and it's being driven by customers, is how they want to shop and the kinds of experiences that they want to have. And so we've got opportunities to adjust our service model in our stores that both are more tailored to how customers want to shop, both the speed at which they want to have an experience or the type of experience they want to have as well as be more efficient with our staffing model.","And so, we see opportunities. We've been testing that this year. In fact, in 2016, we implemented our very first labor scheduling tool, and we'll be getting mature on that this year. But also things that Blake and Mike mentioned around buy online, pick-up in store growing at around 50%, rolling out to store reserve.","These are low-touch experiences where a customer come in and have a great experience, buy a whole bunch of stuff in really a few minutes without as much labor being needed. So we see opportunity in both the near- and longer-terms around being more efficient with our labor dollars in the stores as a percent of sales and continuing to drive productivity out of them.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I wanted to ask on Rack stores, on the new stores. Could you talk about what you're seeing as far as new store productivity goes for the ones you've recently opened? And what the maturity curve looks like today? And maybe if you're seeing any difference in the store comp trend by vintage \u2013 or you called out region for the company, so maybe just by vintage?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Lindsay, this is Blake. On the newer stores, it's meeting and exceeding our expectations. There is a little bit of transfer business as we fill in some markets with our comp stores. I think where we've seen some variability in the last couple of years is what we call non-comps, so stores that are moving from a new store to a fully comp store basis that they're in between.","And so, there is a maturity curve as you just alluded to. But overall, the sales productivity for our Racks have held fairly consistent. We haven't seen a decline in that as we've added new stores. They're very productive, and it's still a real good use of the shareholders' investment dollars.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And maybe the differential by vintage? If you're seeing any difference in comp trend?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","We really don't break that out publicly, so I think my comments would just give you the general overtone of how we look at it.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I'm wondering if you can just talk about how over the last three to four years as your business has evolved to be more of a multi-channel business \u2013 I would assume that means that you're getting to scale in e-commerce and the margins there are improving, at the same time the stores perhaps seem to be seeing a bit of slippage in the margin rate. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how the margin performance in each of those channels has evolved? And do you think we're likely to see some level of stabilization, let's say, in 2017, 2018? The guidance would seem to suggest you're still expecting some deterioration here, so I'm just wondering how we should think about it, let's say, on a three-year outlook? Thank you so much.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure, Kimberly. This is Mike. The first part of your question on where we are with the margins, I mentioned a few minutes ago that we're definitely seeing those two lines crossing. The margins in the e-commerce business are starting to surpass the margins in the store business, and that, to your point, has been about scale.","The challenge with the whole model has been having an accelerating business that has a high variable growth component and a decelerating business that has a high fixed cost component, which both work against you. I think we've made great progress in figuring out how to be more efficient on the e-commerce side, and we're starting to see that.","And as Jamie mentioned, we're making some good progress on the store side, which leads us to the second part of your question, and that is when you see stabilization? And it's tough to answer that until you reach equilibrium, and I don't think we've reached equilibrium in terms of where store sales and e-commerce sales start to level out. And so until we reach that, I think you're going to be experiencing some of this.","Now fortunately, that's just a portion of our model. We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth. So as we continue to make those adjustments going forward and the investments we've made, we continue to believe that all those collectively will put us in a position that we can grow earnings.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure, Kim.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Oh, thank you. I wanted to get you guys to dive in a little bit on the full-line comps. I know it's \u2013 the trends there are what they are, and it's not dissimilar to what other kind of mall-based players are seeing, but how are you thinking about evolving that channel and the importance of that channel and strategies to kind of get that traffic back up in the positive range again?","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure, Omar. This is Jamie. I'll take that one. Yeah, clearly we've got some headwinds that we've been experiencing for the last couple years, and it's been well documented and reported on around other people that do what we do, and mall traffic, and I think our overall category.","What we're encouraged by particularly in our most recent results is a move away from a promotional stance. Our industry has been really promotional for the last couple years, it's been driven by higher inventories. And that's not our business. And of course, we have to compete with that, but as that's cleaned up, that's impacted our results pretty positively. Our inventories are in good shape. The industry has gotten less promotional. And as a result, we're selling a larger percentage of our sales at regular-price. And that's when we're the healthiest.","When we can be bringing in a consistent flow of new merchandise for people to see, keep that merchandise churning and selling things at full-price, good things happen. And we definitely felt we've turned the corner on that over the last quarter.","So next step is to get transactions going, transactions is a proxy for traffic, and it's been declining for the last couple years. We see opportunities to drive traffic through new experiences. I mentioned some of the digital experiences that we've already rolled out. We've got a number of initiatives we'll be rolling out in the next year or two.","Store reserve is a good example where we can use our stores to really connect our online experiences and our store businesses in a pretty profound way. So there's blending of the digital experience across the customers' entire shopping journey. It's a place we've been investing in for some time, and we think we're in the early innings on being able to maximize the foundation and the capabilities that we have there. So we don't want to get into a lot of specifics about things we're going to be rolling out this year, but we look forward to over the next few quarters to be able to share you some results.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's really helpful. And I'm sorry I have to ask, did you see any change in trend in your business at all around the President's tweets, whether it's helped you or hurt you at all? Is there something you can comment on?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Pete. No, that would be negligible. I think it's not really discernible one way or the other.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. I was curious.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Omar.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.\/Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, best of luck always for all the help.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","You're welcome, Ed.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.\/Pacific Crest Securities","Just obviously you guys have talked a lot about the full-line comp, but to kind of further explore, do you think that these are kind of transitory issues that are causing the difficulty of traffic or the full-line business? Or are you of the thought that these are more permanent shifts, and that this is the kind of comp level that you think you're going to have to manage against kind of going forward? And if so, how do you think about the size of the overall store footprint? Thanks.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Ed, this is Jamie. Good question. I'll take the second part first around the footprints. We have roughly 120 full-line stores today. All of them make money; they're all cash flow positive. And we have overall a very healthy fleet of stores. We have, over the last couple of years, closed a few. We've announced one closure this year. That's probably a pretty good pace as we look out over the next five to 10 years that there's some stores in older centers that we think we can close that store and consolidate that business into stores nearby that we're investing in.","So the way that we're looking at our fleets, it has evolved for sure. For one thing, we look at stores that are the only store in a market and they have a huge impact on our overall ability to gain market share in that market. Because it's not just the business we do in the four walls of that store, it's also the online component. And so we look at a city we've got one store, that may only be 50%, 60%, 70% of the business we do in that city once you add in the online component. So we think that we'll be looking at those stores differently in terms of how we invest in those stores.","On the flipside, the fourth or fifth or sixth store in a market, we might look at differently today than we did in the past in terms of the role that it plays in driving business. So you've got two sides of the coin there. We think we have an opportunity to invest in those best stores in those malls that the developers are investing in and are creating better experiences, they're doing great. In the malls that are not being invested in, are not, and those are some of the stores that you might see close.","But overall, to the first part of your question, yeah, people said there's a shift away from buying things to experiences, and I think you can see that around a lot of different parts of our industry and it's debatable whether that's a secular thing or a cyclical thing. We're focused on having something new for the customer that they didn't know they wanted to buy. And if we think we can stick to our knitting and focus on being that place of discovery, being that place where you come to find something new that that's a winning strategy over the long-term.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.\/Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next is Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you, on for Lorraine Hutchinson. I just wanted to ask, first, where are you in the process of replacing promotional brands? Are there still brands that you want to exit or reduce? And then on a different note, are you seeing any \u2013 you've talked about seeing changes in how the customer shops and what she wants. But are you seeing changes in terms of when she shops? There's been some retailers who have come out and talked about even the high-end consumer is waiting for the newest fashions, and at the same time appointment shopping is becoming more prevalent. Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Pete. I'll try to answer those. The promotional brand thing is an ongoing dynamic that we look at. I think the arc of a brand's viability and desirability by our customer maybe has been shortened, and so there is a quick ascension for brands that are a really hot brand but they can fall off rather quickly too. And I think it had a lot to do with the brand's decisions around distribution and how ubiquitous they are out there, and in what channel.","So this is something that we look at all the time. We look at the level of promotional business being done at each brand. And we use that to kind of get to the average. It's a big, big lever for us to not have to be taking unnecessary promotional markdowns. So we are definitely interested in doing less promotional business and, in some cases, that means we're going to not be doing business with some vendor. So that's an ongoing thing. It's a big one for us. And I think the encouraging part of that is for as many brands there may be that become over-promotional online, there's still new ones that come along that are super viable, and have a big interest to customers, and we've got a lot of positive examples to be applying energy towards. So I guess I would say that our merchandising group is feeling pretty optimistic about knowing where to pour on the gas, so to speak.","In terms of when she shops, I don't know if I understand that question exactly. You mentioned something about appointments. Can you elaborate what you mean about that?","Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Sorry. I guess we're hearing \u2013 well, there's two things. One, that the high-end consumer who used to buy, like, a coat in the summer is now waiting until the weather turns colder. Which seems to be new, the high-end consumer tended to buy earlier in the season. And then the other part of it is in terms of appointment shopping, more shopping around events, like a Mother's Day or maybe a sale or that sort of thing.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's true that customers are much more interested in buying now, wearing now. The idea that they would buy something and then put it in their closet for a couple months until the weather changed is not \u2013 I mean that's changed a lot over the years. That's just not a great scenario for us. So we talk a lot about making sure we got the product in the store at the right time for customers. I would also say that there is more a movement around season-less kinds of product, things that can be worn all year long. And we find \u2013 particularly since we do a lot of business in southern states with warmer climates that that's where you see that happen to a greater degree. I mean you still have \u2013 weather drives a lot of business in colder-weather markets around coats and what have you, and that's fairly predictable.","In terms of the shopping happening at specific times of the year, that is true. Events, holidays, what have you, drive a lot of business. And I would say most recent example of holiday \u2013 and we've seen this for the last several years \u2013 it continues to get more and more contracted where we still do a lot of business over a six-week timeframe. It gets concentrated increasingly into that last week. And so, we might feel like, well, the holiday season isn't going very well. Then that last few days, it's amazing, kind of how we make up for it. So the net of all that is we're still doing the business; it's just happening in a more concentrated timeframe.","So I think along the lines of what Jamie's talking about and how to service customers, it's important that we become increasingly efficient and super purposeful about how we allocate inventory, when and where. And so, the supply chain logistics, all that becomes a very important part of what we're doing. And we've gotten better at that over the years, too.","Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Tracy Kogan with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I was wondering what you guys are seeing on the competitive landscape for Rack, I guess both competition for compelling product and also just competition for customers. I was wondering if there's any competitive factor hurting the store comps there. Or do you think it's really just the online business cannibalizing the stores? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Tracy, this is Blake. It is, like all areas of the business, a competitive area and there's been quite a bit growth. So there is more choices for the customer in off-price and in the value segments. We don't situate or compete as much in some of the outlet malls. We find where our best success is closer to our full-line stores. There's a real synergy with our customer back and forth. So in many cases, we're not in location-wise right next to some of those competitors that you traditionally might think about.","We think the challenges we've had, if there's any, been \u2013 of any softening in comps over the years has been opportunities on our end with our execution. And in cases with our accelerated growth where we are \u2013 we have very productive stores and we're opening in another store in that market trade area. And so it's a win for Nordstrom, Inc. and JWN, but that individual store might see a slight, in the short-term, a reduction in some of their key metrics. So overall, you have competitive landscape, but we're still very encouraged by our strategy within the off-price industry, both online and within the stores. And we are very optimistic about the future prospects.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Is there...","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Tracy, I would just add one thing to Blake's comments is that, keep in mind, we've grown the online portion of that business to almost 20%. It's roughly 20% of our off-price business now. We don't believe there's anybody else out there in that space that has that kind of penetration online and off-price. So I think when you look at the combined businesses, which has been averaging 4% to 5% growth, I think we're right up there in terms of taking market share.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Next is Bilun Boyner with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Bilun Boyner - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask about the growth investments. Looks like you're guiding for HauteLook Canada and Trunk Club investments to decrease by about $45 million in 2017. I just wanted to see how that compares to your maybe internal plans a year ago; and if there's one of the growth area that is approaching profitability or lowering expenses faster than you planned or, alternatively, any one of those lagging? I just wanted to see how those growth investments are tracking.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. Sure. Well, this is Mike. In terms of what's driving that, I mean clearly \u2013 I'll start with the HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com \u2013 that business over the last several years we've seen some great growth that was really accelerated when we started to integrate it with the Rack stores and we started taking returns in the stores and we started to bring those two brands together. That business has moved from being an operating loss, and it's moving into 2017 slightly beyond break-even where we're starting to make some operating profit there. So we're making very good progress in that area.","In terms of Trunk Club, we're a little bit disappointed in our sales pace there. Our earnings were better than planned for 2016 as we've made some adjustments there. So I would say, in general, those businesses are roughly operating as expected.","Canada \u2013 I think, generally speaking, sales \u2013 or there's plus or minuses by stores, but it's generally operating as expected. So what you're seeing in the improvement is not so much that we're being surprised or things are outperforming what we thought but that they're starting to scale up to where they need to be and will continue to improve over time.","Bilun Boyner - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. Mike, my best to you.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I wanted to just ask about the credit EBIT guidance and just what you're seeing there. It actually was a bit higher than I was forecasting for 2017, and just want to understand the puts and takes there. And then second, you all had a big increase in your active customers, your Rewards customers. Maybe just walk us through what the spending levels are for that Rewards customers versus non-Reward customers and really what you've learned from that non-tender loyalty program, and what you plan to do with it in 2017? Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. Well, Paul, I'll take those. First as far as the credit EBIT, there's two components that are driving that growth. One was that in 2016, there were some non-cash amortization due to the sale of those credit receivables. And without getting into the complexity of accounting, there are certain assets we needed to recognize when we sold, and those got amortized over a relatively short period of time. We don't have that level of amortization in 2017. So that's one piece.","The second piece is now that we're less capital constrained and we have a great partner in TD Bank, we're able to do more things to grow that portfolio, and so what you're starting to see is some benefit of us changing that operating model and having more capital available to grow that business. And so we would expect not only in 2017, but going forward, to see continued growth there.","In terms of the loyalty program, you may recall we launched that non-tender program back in May. It's been really successful. It definitely taught us that there's a lot of folks out there that would like to have a relationship with us, but don't want another credit card in their wallet, and I think that was really important to extend our relationship with our customers.","Generally speaking, loyalty customers spend three to four times more than non-loyalty customers. That is definitely true on the tender side. I think in the non-tender, we still need to learn more about that, but I think as we go forward some of the more significant things that we're going to be able to do is we need to integrate those two models on one platform. That will allow us to continue to offer more seamless experience and also continue to see some of those customers who are on the non-tender gain greater benefit moving to tender.","So we're excited about that. We're less than a year into it, and I think our plan is to continue to try new things to test to see how customers respond and to certainly further improve the experience for those customers.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Dan Stroller with Nomura-Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Stroller - Nomura Instinet LLC","Hi, guys. It's Dan on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. I think you've mentioned before that 15% of Rack merchandise comes from full-price stores, and that's been taken down a couple points over time. So we're wondering if it's still at that level or where you see it shaking out over time. And then just secondly, quickly, with transactions being down, I'm wondering any update on transaction value or units? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Dan, this is Blake. That number's been fairly consistent of late in that zone. But I think I would emphasize that our model is a little different than many of our competitors because we start with hopefully a very good partnership and relationship with the key vendors from a full-price point of view, and if we do this right we're accretive or positive to the brand if the vendors believe that whether brick-and-mortar or online off-price is something that they would like to do, and we become their first choice. And so, we believe we're able to offer our customers a trend-right product at terrific values at an advantage of many of our competitors. And I think that plays out with the results.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","And this is Jamie. Your question about traffic versus ticket or item transaction numbers, transactions are down, average selling price is up, which I think is reflective of the reduction in the promotional environment over the last quarter.","Daniel Stroller - Nomura Instinet LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Just a quick housekeeping on the fourth quarter. Were you able to isolate or compute any of the comp impact you potentially felt in the Neiman Marcus Friends and Family Event during the quarter? And then I guess my big question was just around Geevy's role as Chief Innovation Officer. I'd love to hear more about what he's focused on and how you're allocating resources towards him, and then who is backfilling his former role as President of the Rack? Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Nordstrom, Inc.","Erinn, this is Mike. I take the first part. In terms of the Neiman event, no, I don't think there was anything that was measurable from that. As far as the Geevy's role, I'll ask Erik to comment on that.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, we view that role as really an addition to the efforts we have going on in full-price, and we've talked to you a lot about investments in not only growing our e-commerce business and how we're addressing our stores, but really core to our strategy of how we leverage those assets across, and to serve customers better. There's a lot of digital tools being rolled out to our stores, there's a lot more options of getting product for their customer, be it buy online, pick-up in store, store reserve, same-day delivery, curbside pickup that's been the channels.","And we're continuing with those. But we felt, given the fast pace of change in particular on the store side, that we need additional efforts around that and Geevy's assignment really is to take a much more future back view of the role of stores in this digitally-connected world. And we certainly view our local assets, and those assets of people, product, and place as being hugely important and giving us a lot of options to serve our customers better. But Geevy's assignment is really to look at regardless of channels to be super customer-focused, and really looking at by market how can we leverage the assets we have, digital and physical, to serve the customer really where she's going as opposed to how do we make what we do today a little better incrementally.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Erinn, this is Blake. Your last question was who's taking Geevy's spot. We took one of our top leaders and someone who has been very successful in many different assignments with us, Karen McKibbin, and gave her that assignment. Most recently, Karen has been focused the last couple of years as President of Canada. She's done a terrific job of getting that region open from scratch. Now that it's up and running, it's more in keeping with the regions. And so, Jamie Nordstrom promoted one of his regional managers, Michelle Haggard, to take Canada, and now we're very excited about Karen both as an executive team member and Head of Nordstrom Rack.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you for that.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

You may begin, sir.","Rob Campbell ","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include about 30 minutes for your questions. As we get started, I'd like to refer you to the slide showing our Safe Harbor Language regarding forward-looking statements.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom, Inc.; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the Company's first quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2014."," ","Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; Erik Nordstrom, President of Stores; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Direct.","Before we begin, I want to mention that Blake and Mike will be using Slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations tab.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake Nordstrom ","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter earnings performance was above our expectations. Comparable sales improved in each month of the quarter, highlighted by the continued outside growth for our online business and accelerating sales trend in the Rack. This was partly offset by ongoing softness in full-line store sales, consistent with what we've experienced in 2013. Mike\u2019s upcoming comments on this call will provide additional detail on the quarter. Along with those we'd like to show a broader perspective of our business, including a current example of the progress we're making that\u2019s indicative of our strategic direction. And then conclude with a few comments on our announcement regarding our credit receivables.","We continue to focus on the execution of our customer strategy with our in-store or online, full price of off-price. At its core, it\u2019s about providing a superior customer experience with our investments and efforts directed toward one Nordstrom approach, that creates synergies and leverages shared assets and capabilities across all channels. An example of this is our launch last week of the Nordstrom Rack e-commerce site and the associated mobile app. We've stated for some time our desire to be wherever our customers want us to be. Our multi-year expansion of Rack stores, which included 10 openings in the first quarter, is giving us increasing relevance with more customers looking for great fashion at great prices. ","Our HauteLook acquisition several years ago, which now has over 17 million members has enhanced our e-commerce capabilities. Now we're combining forces to provide a powerful platform for elevating the customer experience in the online off-price segment. Nostrumrack.com built on the strength of both HauteLook and the Rack. It involves the integration of talent, combining the e-commerce expertise of HauteLook which developed the platform for the site and the merchant expertise of the Rack. It includes one of the largest merchandize offerings in the online off-price segment that encourages shopping a limited time flash sale event, side-by-side, with the persistent selection of off-price product.","It allows merchandize to be shipped faster than most off-price competitors, enabled by our new fulfilment center shared by Rack and HauteLook. Finally, it accommodates easy returns through the mail or at any Rack location, a capability we added in 2013. Concurrent with this is the launch of the associated nordstromrack.com app; its functionality which enables a single login shared shopping cart and streamlined checkout process, reflects of strategic focus on mobile enhancing the customer experience that we will continue to build on as we go forward. As you can imagine we\u2019re excited about nordstromrack.com and its ability to serve customers on their terms. ","Leveraging the many assets and capabilities within our company, in this case, things like people, product, technology, stores and supply chain to provide a superior seamless shopping experience, is something you'll see more from us in the future. Again, we are only a week old here and there is a lot of learning in front of us. We are committed to expanding the merchandise offering as we learn more about what our customers want online and transitioning overtime to a more consistent offering relative to our Rack stores. We're off to a good start and we\u2019ll keep you informed of our progress. Now I'd like to discuss the announcement of our earnings release related to our credit card receivables. ","As we've commented on in the past, our credit program is an extension of our brand and an intrical part of the customer experience. Because of this, it\u2019s critically important that we are able to manage all key aspects of this part of our business. In addition, we have an outstanding team of Nordstrom employees that manage and execute our credit business extremely well. That said, the credit environment has evolved, such that today we believe we can pursue an arrangement that allows us to maintain and enhance our customer focus while gaining greater financial flexibility to the potential sale of our credit receivables. We anticipate any partnership to have a minimal impact on existing operations and jobs.","In conclusion, we feel encouraged by the progress we are making. We are strong in our convictions as ever about our customer strategy and the investments we're making to support it. And we look forward to continued progress throughout the year. ","With that I\u2019ll turn over the call to Mike.","Mike Koppel","Thanks Blake. Before commenting on our first quarter\u2019s performance, I'd like to reinforce Blake\u2019s comments by emphasizing the importance we place on the subject of relevance and our ability to evolve with our customer. In today\u2019s rapidly changing environment, we are uniquely positioned to serve customers to multiple touch points, whether it\u2019s in-store or online, full price, or off-price. This is enabled through ongoing investments in all of our channels and more importantly through the synergies across channels. Through these synergies we are differentiated in our ability to better serve our existing customers and to attract new customers by creating a seamless shopping experience.","The launch of nordstromrack.com, which is integrated with HauteLook\u2019s online and mobile experience is a great example of this. We are encouraged with the opportunities ahead, to further maximize our customers' experience through the synergies created by your ongoing investments in stores, technology, marketing and supply chain.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our financial performance for the first quarter. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.72 were above our outlook of $0.60 to $0.70 that we provided at the beginning of the year. We delivered total sales growth of 6.8% over last year with comparable sales increase of 3.9%. ","We continue to be pleased with our inventory performance and in the quarter with inventory that is current and on plan. On a square-footage basis ending inventory growth of 10% over last year outpaced sales growth of roughly 4%, primarily due to increased pack and hold inventory to fuel Racks growth, planned increases in well performing merchandize categories and the buildup of inventory related to the nordstromrack.com launch.","Gross profit decreased by 124 basis points over last year, in part due to increased competitive markdowns. In keeping with our long-standing practice of not being undersold on like items, we took additional markdowns in response to the heightened promotional environment. More than half of the decrease in gross profit was associated with planned growth related to Nordstrom Rack\u2019s accelerated expansion and our Nordstrom Rewards program. We continued to be encouraged with the momentum in our Nordstrom Rewards program, with over 275,000 accounts opened this quarter, an increase of roughly 25% over last year.","On the expense side, we demonstrated consistent execution, driving an improvement of 40 basis points in SG&A rate over last year. This improvement reflected lower variable costs in addition to overhead expense leverage on higher sales volume. ","Next, I'd like to add some color on our long-term growth strategy. As we previously shared with you, we plan to invest $3.9 billion in capital over the next five years as we focus on serving more customers through store and online growth. An important element is our technology investments, which represent $1.2 billion or 30% of our capital plan. Approximately 40% of our technology capital relates to infrastructure to support our growth plans and to facilitate enterprise-wide synergies. ","This encompasses systems to support merchandizing, Canada Rack store growth and marketing. Another 40% is planned in support of our online growth, including expansion of our fulfillment network to increase speed of delivery and furthering our customers' mobile and personalization experience. The remaining 20% is focused on increasing our relevance in stores with enhanced tools for our salespeople, such as our new texting platform and point-of-sales solutions.","Over the last several months we've made meaningful progress in our investments. Highlights include delivery of the inventory system to support our upcoming entry into Canada. In addition, our new fulfillment center in San Bernardino is now supporting our integrated off-price online offer of nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. ","Finally, our tools to produce better customer data analytics are providing greater insights into the acquisition and retention of customers, their migration between channels and their shopping preferences, all of which we are incorporating into our efforts to create a better customer experience. These investments contribute to us achieving long-term profitable growth. Our confidence remains high in our customer strategy, which we believe will generate top quartile shareholder returns to high single digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. ","Now, I'd like to add to Blake\u2019s comments regarding our announcement on our credit card receivables. Our credit business represents a core component and how we serve customers. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our credit portfolio, as demonstrated through continued improvement in credit metrics, including delinquency and write-off rates which are near a five-year low. Due to a variety of factors, we believe the time is right to explore a potential partnership that could enable us to gain greater financial flexibility while retaining our control over the customer experience. ","As there's been the case with others who have gone through this process, we expect the final outcome to take 12 months to 18 months to complete. During this time, we will refine our plan for the use of proceeds, consistent with our capital structure framework and balanced approach to capital allocation. To assist us, we have retained Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities to serve as financial advisors. We will provide additional communication once this exploration process is concluded.","I'd like to wrap up by providing a few comments on our 2014 outlook. We reiterate our earnings per diluted share outlook of $3.75 to $3.90 per share, which incorporates our first quarter results including the full-year impact of share repurchases. Our topline expectations are unchanged, with total sales growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and a comparable sales increase of 2% to 4%. ","Gross profit rate is expected to decrease 30 basis points to 50 basis points over last year, compared with prior outlooks decrease of 10 basis points to 30 basis points. This adjustment reflects current performance and assumptions around the promotional environment in the near term. As always we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout this year. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob.","Rob Campbell","","Thank you, Mike. Before taking the first question we want to ask that each person ask one question and if necessary one follow up in order to give as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question. If you have additional questions please return to the queue. With that in line we\u2019ll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Oliver Chen from Citi Research. Oliver, your line is open. Please check your mute feature.","Prashant Rao - Citi Research","","Hi, this is Prashant Rao in for Oliver Chen. How are you guys doing?","Mike Koppel","Good. How are you?","Prashant Rao - Citi Research","Good. I had a couple of questions, first one on the inventory guidance, if you could talk about going forward, how you are thinking about inventory and sort of the nature of your current inventory and what you\u2019re thinking in terms of the next couple of quarters?","Mike Koppel","Sure. Well, in terms of inventory guidance, we don\u2019t normally guide specifically as it relates to inventory, but that being said, we continue to monitor the aging of our inventory very well and balance improving our turns with the fact that we\u2019re funding growth businesses. So, I think you should see similar relationships as we go through the year and certainly as we start to comp some of the growth you\u2019ll see the inventory line up more closely with sales.","Prashant Rao - Citi Research","Okay, great. And then if I could, I'm curious about the Rack -- the 6.4 comp. I was wondering how much of that was traffic led?","Blake Nordstrom","We don\u2019t measure, this is Blake. We don\u2019t measure traffic per se, but we\u2019ve been really pleased with the conversion and receptance from the customer on the product offering. And so, it is an improvement from the trend over 2013 and we\u2019re really encouraged by a number of things that have been focused on by the Rack team and how the customer is responding to it. So we\u2019re hopeful that will continue throughout this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited","","Hi, everyone. Good job in a tough environment. Could you talk about the crossover from -- any crossover from Rack and HauteLook over the past year with the full-line stores? And then also could you quantify the 17,000 customers -- can you give us the last year number?","Mike Koppel","Sure, in terms of the crossover -- Jamie do you want to?","Jamie Nordstrom","","Sure, are you asking about crossover between customers who shop in HauteLook and Rack and full-line store?","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited","Yes.","Jamie Nordstrom","So we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we have numbers that we share on that but I think it\u2019s safe to say that what we feel that we can create lot of value and particularly relevant customer experiences when we can do things for customers that create those seamless experiences between those channels. So an example of that is something we\u2019ve been doing for long time where you can buy something on nordstrom.com, you can return it in one of our full-line stores, last year we enabled that, to be able to return HauteLook items into our Rack stores. And we know that when we do that customers appreciate because they appreciate the convenience and the speed of making that return easier. So, we got a number of things that we do -- the breakdown those seams between those channels and as we make further progress on that, we see more customer migration between them.","Mike Koppel","","Barbara, this is Mike and the second part I think you were referring to the 17 million members at HauteLook?","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited","Right, 17 million. Yes.","","Mike Koppel","And that number last year was roughly in the 14 million range.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited","Okay, thanks.","Mike Koppel","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","","Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Congratulations on the results and also on the rack.com launch. Just wondering on the full-line stores, it seems like the comp there was a little bit better. And I know you\u2019ve made a lot of progress in terms of the women\u2019s apparel offering, changes to the Savvy assortment and Topshop introductions. I'm just wondering how you\u2019re feeling about that segment of the business obviously accessories has been strong kind of everywhere, but wondering how you\u2019re feeling about women\u2019s apparel at this point?","Pete Nordstrom","","This is Pete, women\u2019s apparel -- it's a story we\u2019ve been talking about here for the last gosh 18 months or so where we've improved to the point where we've been at par outpacing the average growth that we\u2019re having amongst all divisions in this -- this last quarter we were right pretty much on line with the average. So it\u2019s gone pretty well, I think that it\u2019s fair to say that the things that we tried to do to evolve the departments to be more relevant and gain more customers has worked, but that journey is not ended and we have to keep going. I think probably the part of that equation when you look at women\u2019s apparel in totality is we've got to figure out a way of improving the juniors\u2019 part of the business. It\u2019s a big business for us and it serves more than just the teenage customer, it serves young women as well. And I think that we\u2019ve got to make that better and when we do I think it'll benefit the entire women\u2019s results. ","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","And then just any changes, any update on what you are doing with Topshop? If you're planning on expanding that further?","Pete Nordstrom","Right, it's been good for us. We've learned a lot together. We've had good growth and it's doing exactly what we hoped it would. It's bringing in new customer, it's making the customer we have happy. It's kind of enabled the entire women's business to grow, it's lifted all boats, so we've got in 41 stores I believe now and we were just in London recently and talking about how we can continue to expand, to be in more stores and I'm not sure what that ultimate number is. So we'd like to be able to add more in the fall, say 20 more stores in the fall. We haven't nailed all those plans down specifically, but the spirit of intense has aligned and we're going to continue to grow that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","Congrats on a good quarter in a tough environment. I have two questions, one just a follow-up to the question you just answered. Would you think to shrink the square footage for BP? Because there seems to be a lot of overlap. And then I just wondered if you thought you would have BP changed for the anniversary sale, because you talked about that a little bit on the last call? And then I have one other question.","Blake Nordstrom","In terms of shrinking square footage, I think the answer is probably no in that regard. But if you look at what we've done in women's apparel and the way that we've laid out stores and then to renovations in new stores, we've created way more flexibility so that we can find the appropriate amount of space to chase the business that's really working for us. And I think anything that we can do to make that space more flexible, more dynamic, is probably going to be a good thing for us. But I think in terms of being able to serve that customer segment, we need to make that investment for a space and in inventory I think to do a good job serving that customer segment, which is an important segment for us. Now the second part, I don't know if you could repeat that question, Jennifer?","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","Well, do you think that you'll have the BP merchandise teams in time for anniversary sale?","Blake Nordstrom","Well, we'd like to think we've made all the necessary corrections to have it work super well. But the good news about that business is it turns pretty fast and we have the ability to react and so we're on it. We have a team that feels like we would address the issues and we've learnt from some of the shortcomings we've had in the last year. So I think you should expect that business to improve and it has relatively, but we have ways to go still. So we're cautiously optimistic there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thank you so much. It looks like you had a nice sort of resurgence in sales here in the first quarter with the $180 million increase year-over-year. It doesn't seem to be translating into net income growth, I'm wondering if maybe you could just bucket for us the biggest reason for that differential? And then if you look at the year, do you think that we could actually start seeing some net income growth as we get into the back half of the year? Thank you so much.","Mike Koppel","Kimberly, this is Mike. Our performance in the first quarter as it relates to that is very consistent with our plans and what we shared last quarter. In that -- we are incurring costs to prepare for the launching in Canada. We add those costs that are not accompanied by any sales right now, so that's putting some pressure on the P&L. We also have had some significant amount of technology investments from an infrastructure standpoint that are playing out in the P&L, and we also have a large Rack growth planned this year. And as we bring those leases online, we're incurring the lease expense for that before the store is open. So, all those things are very consistent with what we've been talking about, so nothing has changed materially from our plans and the performance that's reflected this quarter. In terms of the back half for the year, some of that should normalize just a slight bit as those stores start to open and you start to see the anniversary of that. But clearly the commitments we've made to grow our business and to invest in the future is what's impacting the P&L this year.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Mike Koppel","","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. My question is around the new Rack app that you guys just launched with HauteLook. Just first off, I really commend the team for the checkout path. I would completely agree with your assessment, that is very slick, very much on par with straight up e-commerce guys out there, so well done. But, Mike I'm wondering a little bit here on financially, as it relates to how these sales are going to roll into the P&L. Are we going to see some more restatements as to how you guys are going to be reporting the Direct sales? Will the Rack division sales go in Direct, or will it be its own Rack Direct or HauteLook? I mean, could you give us some sense as what you're doing? Thanks.","Mike Koppel","Thanks Neely. Well, you know something that's a great question, because clearly how we, how the customer looks at it and how the customer experience isn't necessarily always the way it gets reported. But in this particular case, the whole online experience for Rack will be reported under the HauteLook numbers. All that activity is being supported by the HauteLook technology platform and the controls all exist there. And so currently that's how we're looking at it.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks.","Mike Koppel","","Thanks Neely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joan Payson from Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarter. I have a question about Canada and I guess any updated thoughts you have, now that you've started developing, maybe what you've learned about the market in terms of how it's differentiated from the U.S. And then any updated plans around your operating loss expectations?","Erik Nordstrom","I'll take that, this is Erik. We're up to our eyeballs right now preparing for our Calgary launch in September, and it's going real well. It's a lot of work, there is a lot of business process changes to go through. And as you know, our strategy has been to open one store at a time and we're even more encouraged about that than ever. We'll go in with one store and we have the five others planned out. But no doubt, we'll learn a lot. The nice thing of going with one store is we're going to be able to scramble around and I think make those adjustments very, very quickly to what we learn from the customer. So, your question, have we learned more? We think we have, but I hesitate in saying too much about it, because we really won't know until we open. We go in with a lot of humility, it's not easy to go to another country and we have to win with the customer. So we're going in with an underdog mentality. And we've hired a department manager at this point. We're really encouraged with the quality of those folks, but they are on a hard track right now to get up to speed. The merchandise, we're encouraged about, we've had great reception from our vendor partners. But again, we're going to go in very humble and see how it works, and I think we're positioned very well to respond quickly and be very nimble.","Mike Koppel","John, this is Mike. The second part of the question was on the operating loss related to Canada this year. And I think last quarter we talked about roughly $35 million, and we're on track, we incurred roughly, I guess a quarter of that in the first quarter. So, no changes to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc.","Edward Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first, you guys have managed your credit card business extraordinarily well through the tough parts of the credit cycle. I guess is there anything strategically that's causing you to rethink keeping those receivables on balance sheet, is it a financing environment issue or is it? And how should we think about the longer term return profile of the business ex-credit?","Mike Koppel","Sure. Well, Ed, I'll take that, this is Mike. We've been pretty consistent over a long period of time emphasizing how important it is to serve our customers in a brand consistent way with our tender of products. And we always felt that that was so important that we were willing to carry that asset and basically earn a return that was noticeably lower than the rest of our business, because we felt there was great synergy there. But that being said, we've seen a lot of changes in the industry over the last several years, and we believe there could be an opportunity for us to monetize those receivables and at the same time continuing to retain control over the customer experience. So, we finally have reached the point where we're going to explore that and I'll underscore the word explore, because it's something we don't necessarily have to do. It's something that we believe if we can successfully execute, then it'll be a win-win. So, that's how we're thinking. In terms of the impact to the return on the business -- if you do the simple math on it, it's a multiple hundred basis point impact to return on capital post some execution and deployment of the capital that we would get out of that.","Edward Yruma \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Great. And a follow-up if I may. On the promotional environment, I know you've been -- you've always had the mantra that you will not be undersold in the full-line stores and clearly competitors are using promotions more aggressively. Is there anything you could do from a merchandising perspective or a relationship with vendor perspective to alleviate some of this pressure that you see in the marketplace? Thanks.","Pete Nordstrom","This is Pete. Yes, the competitive issue has been, it's been made more dramatic by the fact that the online business has really made things much more transparent and really better for customers if all the choices are out there. And so, the game is changing a little bit in terms of exactly how we compete, but we want to stick with this idea that we want to have integrity and transparency with our customers and to having the best prices for the stuff that we sell. ","I think information is always helpful in terms of finding a path forward in terms of when we work with vendors, what have you. So we're talking to each other about the impacts of what all these competitive decisions mean and how we can grow our business together. But it's hard to say much really beyond that, other than they have a stake in this as well and we have to be dynamic in terms of the way we look at it, make sure that we're making decisions that are in the best interest of the customer and that's the path we're on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking all the questions. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the inventory. I think you alluded to that it was mostly pack and hold and that's in the Rack. Is that primarily pack and hold from your own goods or is that just extra good deals that you got from vendors and besides you couldn't pass it up?","Mike Koppel","Paul, this is Mike. The pack and hold refers to the product that we're purchasing directly from vendors, and yes it's usually great opportunistic buys that we have that usually come at the -- towards the end of the season that we can get some significant units at a great value for the following season.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc","So, when you say following season, you mean year-over-year?","Mike Koppel","Yes, year-over-year season. Thank you.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc","Yes. And then, so eventually with that reverser, or do you see that as sort of an ongoing strategy that would have just more inventory in general?","Mike Koppel","Yes well, we've seen it grow pretty substantially over the last several years for a couple of reasons. Number one is, we've made it a key strategic lever for us to get the best product and best brands. But the second is with the growth of the Rack. The Rack is growing at such a pace, we not have the impact of that core strategy, but we have the impact of a significant growth in the business, which as you can see is -- grew 20% last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Good afternoon. Great quarter guys. Just starting with the credit card, just a follow up on that. Is the best way to think about the portfolio Mike still -- kind of make an assumption that 80% of the receivables is backed by debt. So in a scenario in which you did receive proceeds and have a transaction, you would probably primarily use the proceeds to pay that corresponding debt down?","Mike Koppel","Well, I think on a more theoretical basis that's how some may view our balance sheet. In fact, we only have a little over 300 million that securitized against those receivables. And as I said in my comments, if this should happen we will go back and re-evaluate our capital structure. We've always said we want to be 1.5 to 2.5 adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. We'll go back and look at that and see what makes sense for us, if in fact we don't have those receivables on the books.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Understood. And then just on full year guidance, the 6.8% sales growth in 1Q was pretty close to the middle of your full year guidance. And obviously, you're opening up a number of stores as the year goes on including three full-line stores, one in Canada in 3Q. I'm just trying to get some color on why the sales view was not adjusted? Higher perhaps. Is there anything that we need to keep in mind? And on a similar front, the gross profit performance obviously in 1Q is well below what you're modeling for the full year. I'm just wondering why that dynamic will change so dramatically over the next few quarters on the final gross margins? ","Mike Koppel","Well, starting with the sales -- first to make sure we have clarity, the full year total sales guidance was 3.5% to 5.5%, I'm sorry, 5.5% to 7.5%. And yes, we did reach the high end of that. One quarter in our mind doesn't give us enough certainty and clarity that that's the trend for the entire year. So, we believe it's prudent at this point in time to stay with our initial sales guidance. There's not enough material difference between baking that in and what the future could bring to make any adjustments. So, we're stuck with that. ","In terms of gross profit, clearly the first quarter, we felt was pretty significant from a promotional standpoint. I think there's some that believe there is an element of that that related to a very tough weather pattern that created some excess inventory in the system that was cleared. We have accounted for some level of promotion going forward, but certainly not to the same extent that we experienced in the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good afternoon. Just as a follow-up, the gross margin guidance maybe a little bit lighter, you also changed your SG&A guidance, and I was just curious as to what's changing on that line item for the year?","Mike Koppel","Lorraine, this is Mike. Well, a big part of that was, some of the efforts in the first quarter allowed us some pretty good leverage and we see some of that continuing. The most significant is we've made some really good progress in some of our fulfilment efforts which is a pretty significant variable cost. And we see those activities somewhat continuing as the year goes on. But it was mostly about first quarter performance.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just to clarify on the gross margin, do you expect the competitive pressures to abate as the year goes on?","Mike Koppel","Well, as I just stated, we don't believe it's going to be as significant as it was in the first quarter, because of the seasonal transition in the weather patterns. But I think, frankly it's as good as guess as any as to whether or not that's going to continue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter. I know we've beat you to death on the gross margin question at this point, but as you think about it, Mike if you do see the competitive environment getting more promotional, which we are seeing in some of the more mid-tier retailers. Would your preference be to go after the share and the traffic at the expense of gross margins or would you try to protect margins?","Mike Koppel","Well, I would start with our basic principle, and that is, we've always said that on any like item, we're not going to be undersold. And that's how we're going to operate. We've been very consistent, our customers expect that from us and that's how we'll move forward. Now that being said, we would hope that our product offering is substantially differentiated from some of those mid-tiers that you stated. So hopefully that gives us a little bit more strength in pricing.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay. And then I guess at a higher level, as you think about moving into the Rack.com business -- what kind of things do you think about as far measuring the incrementality of that business versus the risks that come up when you think about, perhaps somebody switching from a higher price point item on your full-price Nordstrom, even like more expensive shirt for the same brand, I can find a less expensive version on Rack. How do you think about protecting yourself from that? We've certainly seen the retailers who've had less good luck trying to isolate the channels like that.","Mike Koppel","Well, I'll start by saying we're not interested in isolating the channels. The reason we've invested the way we have is because we want to have a complete offering online, in-store, regular price and off-pricing. We believe that that's going to allow us to engage with more customers and we also believe particularly in the online and off-price segment that it's a great vehicle for us to acquire new customers. And we find that a lot of those customers do migrate to a regular price offering as time goes on, and we also have regular price customers that periodically look to shop at the Rack. And as long as we can continue to offer that more robust offering, we believe we're going to create more lifelong customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Tracy Kogan - Wells Fargo","Hey, thanks. It's Tracy filling in for Paul. Just had another question on more aggressive promotions. Was that primarily at the full-line stores or did you find that at the Rack you also needed to be a little more aggressive on pricing? And secondly, does Rack.com, does that change your view of the ultimate potential number of stores you could have for the Rack business? Thanks.","Pete Nordstrom","This is Pete. In terms of the promotional pricing, it was really largely full-line stores. Full price business where we, not just stores, but online too. But the full price part of our business where that was an issue.","Blake Nordstrom","This is Blake, regarding your question on Rack.com and how it may or may not impact our aspiration for opening the stores. We think it's a key component of complementing the customer experience for that store growth, and that they go hand in hand, just like over the last 10 years with the full-line store customer having the corresponding e-commerce experience, it's important in off-price online.","Tracy Kogan - Wells Fargo","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Research","Hi, let me add my congratulations on a great quarter. I guess in looking at your business in the first quarter, I guess it would probably be fair to say that weather impacted you on the topline less than the rest of the retail space given your geographic concentration, that's a question although I stated it as a comment. And if that's the case, did you not see the sort of improvement that other people are talking about in April and May? Thanks.","Mike Koppel","Liz, this is Mike. I guess to the extent that the math as a percent of total would suggest that we have less business in the areas most hit the hardest, I guess the answer to that would be, yes. I mean those that were more concentrated in the Northeast corridor, and certainly others in Midwest would probably be hit harder. But that said, out stores in those regions did experience some very difficult business during that period. And I'm sorry, the second...","Pete Nordstrom","(Indiscernible) Our business did get better as the quarter went on. First month was, February was the toughest month of the quarter for us and last month was the best.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay great. And then just one on the credit, if I may, is the time period to get this deal done really in part influenced by your desire to just really get the right service agreement in place because it seems like a little bit of a longer time period and then what are we to assume that you'll do with the cash?","Mike Koppel","First part of your question, the answer is yes. We are going to be very focused on insuring that we have an agreement that enables us to serve our customers at the highest level. And the second part in terms of the cash, you know at this point in time, we would evaluate that consistently with the way we've done every other use of capital and that is, we have a pretty balanced approach to our structure as well as our allocation. And should this happen, and we realize that cash, we'll be in a position to talk more about that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Wilson from Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group","Thanks for taking my question. Mike, is it fair to say in your gross profit margin guidance that you're expecting a year-over-year improvement by the end of maybe Q3 or Q4?","Mike Koppel","I don't believe so. I think when you look at our guidance for the year, it's down over the last year.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group","Your guidance says negative 30 to negative 50, but it was now...","Mike Koppel","So you're saying the math on the back half of the year?","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group","Yes.","Mike Koppel","The math on the back half of the year is -- there is some volatility in there, but it's relatively flat. What you're seeing is just a mix that impacted the back half quarters being better than the first quarter.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group","If I could ask one follow-up, do you have a completely separate infrastructure in Canada?","Erik Nordstrom","It's Erik. No, we have a President of Canada, Karen McKibbin. We certainly have a dedicated team, but for the most part we are leveraging our company assets across the organization to support that store.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today is from Mark Altschwager from Robert Baird.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Company","Thank you and good afternoon. Could you talk about your inventory strategy with Rack e-commerce business and how much integration exists between the physical and online offering? And obviously you're a company that's very focused on the customer experience, but with off-price inventory availability and breath of sizes can sometimes be a source of customer frustration. So, just wanted to know how if the lines between flash sale and off-price online merge, how you're thinking about ensuring that positive customer experience?","Blake Nordstrom","","Jamie, you want to take that one or you want me to take it? This is Blake.","Jamie Nordstrom","I'll take a stab at it. I think you nailed it. It's not exactly obvious how to create a great customer experience on that. I think one thing that we're excited about is the experience that our HauteLook team has in that space over the last five years of serving those customers, working with those brands, managing those inventories. They've learned a lot and they've done some pretty innovative things. You combine with our Rack team, our Rack merchants who've been running that business pretty darn well for a number of years now and have a lot of experience with, a lot of the same vendors in how to manage inventories of a lot of units, when you don't have a lot of depth and you don't have a lot of consolidation of cleaned sizements or those kinds of things. So, it's I think a lot of people who have tried this have been running lot of those challenges over the years. ","Again, what we're excited about is, as you take those two really talented teams, you're putting together. They've come up with what we think is a pretty compelling suite of offerings and experiences for customers in the off-price world, that's really differentiated. And I know, Neely mentioned the app earlier -- we're really proud of what that team has built and we think it's going to resonate with customer so far so good. And we're going to learn a lot and it's going to evolve over time and we think it's going to be a big business for us.","Blake Nordstrom","Mark, this is Blake. To add to Jamie's comments on the selection, I made a brief comment to that, that we feel compared to what's currently out there with some of our competitors that this is a superior offering. But we're in early days and a lot of this inventory is from the HauteLook side of the equation and our Rack merchants now are overtime now going to be adding the selection that we have on the Rack side. So, the selection, the amount of skills that we have will continue to build. And so we're really encouraged about what that means over the next couple of quarters.","Bob Campbell","Thank you for joining us today.

Nordstrom","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared in the earnings release, our first quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, with strong top line performance across all channels. The consistent execution in our core business, combined with our healthy financial position, has given us the flexibility to more aggressively pursue growth opportunities, particularly in e-commerce. Having already established a solid foundation of multichannel capabilities, which we continue to benefit from, we're accelerating our efforts to further enhance the customer experience and increase our relevance with existing and new customers. Selection, speed and convenience have always been important to our customers, but they are becoming even more critical going forward. ","Here are a few highlights. In e-commerce, we made enhancements to our websites to improve things such as navigation, graphics and making the checkout process faster and easier. We increased the selection of merchandise in a number of online departments and added to the functionality of our mobile apps. We increased the speed of fulfillment and delivery while making returns easier. These types of initiatives are ongoing, and the benefits of these efforts are reflected in the continuing strong, top line growth we're seeing in our Direct channel. ","In April, we announced our partnership with online men's retailer, Bonobos. Established in 2007, Bonobos quickly earned a reputation for making great-fitting pants and offering a convenient shopping experience. It's a fast-moving online retailer that has been successful in connecting and gaining relevance with the contemporary customer. We value the opportunity to expand our capabilities through an upclose view of its Web-driven brand, while gaining access to a great-fitting, energetic clothing line to add to our men's assortment.","Recent store openings also offer example of how we're evolving in response to our customers' want to shop. In March, we reentered the Salt Lake City market with the successful opening of our store at City Center Creek. We provided this store with roughly 150 mobile point-of-sale devices to help make shopping faster and more convenient. This was the largest rollout to date, with the store carrying 3x as many of these devices as cash registers. We've been adding to both the functionality and number of these devices based on what we've learned since our initial rollout during the first half of 2011. And we'll continue to build in new features that make them even more helpful to our customers. ","In March, we also relocated our downtown Seattle Rack store and had a strong reopening at its new location across the street from our Nordstrom flagship store. This store, 1 of 5 Racks opened during the quarter, includes 16 mobile point-of-sale devices. In the first 2 months of operation, we've seen a significant increase in the speed of point-of-sale, which translates into a better service experience in the Rack. Our learnings in this store will be applied to a broader rollout of these devices in all Rack locations later this year.","During the quarter, we saw a favorable response from our customers to the enhancements we made to our Fashion Rewards program. You might recall that the changes we made essentially were about convenience, giving our customers greater control over how and when to use their benefits and to make more of the benefits more easily accessible. It's still early, but in the first quarter, we've seen new Fashion Reward accounts increase by nearly 50% from a year ago. We are pleased with this program that allows us to build and strengthen our relationships with customers. ","Again, these are just a few examples of the meaningful growth opportunities to improve upon the customer experience in all channels. We believe strongly in our strategic direction of elevating the customer experience, both in-store and online.","Over the past 12 months, we've made substantial progress through our efforts in undertaking multiple initiatives, including the acquisition of HauteLook, rollout of mobile point-of-sale devices, free shipping and returns, enhanced Fashion Rewards, our partnership with Bonobos, growing our e-commerce capabilities, continuing expansion of the Rack, and there will be more. We are moving more quickly, we're accelerating our learning and we're acting on our commitment to improve the customer experience.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. Our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive top line performance through our aggressive growth strategy. As we've shared previously, we are undergoing a step change in terms of the level of investments we are making to significantly enhance the customer experience, particularly in e-commerce. We're continuing our expansion of Nordstrom Racks and remain focused on increasing productivity in our full-line stores. We are firmly convinced that our strategic direction is sound, and we feel confident that the strength of our business will continue. ","We are moving at a fast pace. Although our operating model is evolving, we remain disciplined in our approach to the investments we're making and in our focus on execution. Even with these additional investments, we anticipate achieving in 2012 the highest EBIT dollar performance in the history of the company, driven by the strong sales momentum we're experiencing. And as we view the longer-term outlook, we are squarely on track with our overarching goals of achieving high single-digit top line growth and mid-teens return on invested capital.","For the first quarter, our earnings per diluted share of $0.70 represented an increase of 8% from last year. Our earnings before interest and income taxes totaled $280 million, an increase of 2.9% from last year. Total sales increased 13.7% while same-store sales increased 8.5%. Nordstrom same-store sales, which include our full-line and Direct businesses, were up 9.3%, with Handbags, Women's Shoes and Men's Shoes as our top-performing merchandise categories. Same-store sales at full-line increased 5.6%, with the South and Midwest as our top-performing regions. Direct continues to be our fastest-growing business, delivering sales growth of 44.2% over last year. Nordstrom Rack total net sales grew 19.6%, with same-store sales up 6.8%.","First quarter gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 31 basis points to 37.5%, which is mostly due to our enhanced customer loyalty program and the reduction of shipping revenue associated with free shipping and return introduced last fall.  Total sales per square foot increased 10.1%, while our ending inventory per square foot increased 16%. Our inventory levels are aligned with our merchandise plans. The gap is indicative of the accelerated growth we are seeing both online and in-store. Our inventory turn of 5.4x, down slightly from Q1 of 2011, was in line with our expectations, that anticipate a year-over-year improvement for the full year. The percentage of regular price sales continued to increase compared to last year, which is attributable to the ongoing benefits from our multichannel capabilities.","Retail SG&A expense increased $110 million during the quarter. Roughly half was related to our e-commerce growth strategy, focused on building capabilities to improve selection, convenience and the overall service experience online. In total, they are fueling the outside sales increases we're achieving in this channel. The majority of the remaining increase in SG&A was attributable to the sales growth in existing and new stores. While we're accelerating the growth in e-commerce because of the rich opportunity we believe it represents, our in-store business continues to deliver incremental profits on incremental sales that are in line with our expectations and with our recent historical performance. ","Next, we will turn to our performance in credit, where the positive trends continued. In addition to the early indicators Blake mentioned with respect to the enhanced Fashion Rewards program and the growth in the number of new accounts, we again saw improving trends in our credit metrics. It was notable that the write-off rate declined to 4.7% from 7% a year ago. Combined with the review of our overall credit portfolio performance and economic outlook, we have reduced the reserve for bad debt by $10 million. We ended the quarter with bad debt reserves as a percent of ending credit card receivables of 5.2%, down from 6.7% last year.","Our financial position remains strong, with $1.6 billion of cash and total liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.1x is well within the range of investment-grade. In April, we retired $500 million in securitized notes at maturity. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares at an average price of $50.79 for a total of $40 million. We have $1.1 billion remaining under our current authorizations. ","Our EPS outlook for fiscal year 2012 is unchanged. We increased retail SG&A guidance by $10 million to reflect additional e-commerce opportunities that we are moving forward with. This is offset by a $10 million reduction in credit SG&A guidance as a result of the Q1 reduction in the reserve for bad debt. ","We are pleased with the strength of our sales. However, we believe it makes sense at this point to maintain our existing view of 2012 earnings, given that we are only one quarter into the fiscal year.  This year's Anniversary Sale, our largest sale event of the year, begins 1 week later in July this year versus last year. As a result, an additional week of this year's event occurs in August, which is in our third quarter. To better understand the estimated impact on our financial performance, we provided directional comments in the earnings release on the timing of sales, gross profit and SG&A over the remaining quarters of 2012.","In closing, our first quarter's performance is on track with our long-term growth plan. We are excited about the momentum in our business, the strength of our financial position and the multiple opportunities we see to drive growth and enhance the customer experience.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So in terms of expense side of things, Mike, with 50% of the deleverage you attributed to the stores, was that basically technology-related? Can dive into that a little bit deeper?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Sure, Deborah. I didn't say that we were delevering. I said that half of the $110 million in expense dollars increase was due to the stores. Now of that, we did get a percent of sales leverage on a store performance. Where we saw the deleverage from a percent of sales is from the accelerated investment in the e-commerce and technology space.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the credit card penetration, can you talk about where that is now? And how are your new Fashion Reward customers shopping you differently?","Michael G. Koppel","In terms of the credit card penetration, can you give me a little bit more clarity on that?","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just where are you in terms of your Nordstrom customer -- yes, your Nordstrom card...","Michael G. Koppel","Okay. Yes. We are roughly 1\/3 plus of our overall volume is done on our various tenders, including our debit card and our private label Retail and the cobranded Visa. We continue to see really accelerated growth as a result of Fashion Rewards. And one of the things that we did start this year is offering rewards in the Rack. And so we continue to see a lot of growth there of which over half of those are debit cards. And of course, the Rack continues to attract a relatively younger customer, and so we like that pipeline. But the overall health of folks being able to get in the program earlier, move up the various levels faster and be able to enjoy the benefits quicker are paying off.","Operator","Our next question is from Michelle Clark from Morgan Stanley.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The first question is your gross margin guidance for the year implies that back half gross margin performance will be better than the first half. And I'm just trying to figure out why that would be, given my guess is the rewards program will continue to offer the benefits it does today. And then I'm guessing that you would expect that the e-commerce business would continue its strength.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Michelle, this is Mike. One of the primary reasons is that we'll be lapping over when we give free shipping and returns, which I believe started sometime in September last year. And so the impact to that will be neutralized after we cross that.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then my second question was what was e-commerce growth in the first quarter of last year? So if it was up 44% this year, how much was it last year in the first quarter?","Michael G. Koppel","I don't we believe we disclosed it last year first quarter. But needless to say, it was a strong double-digit comp increase.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just, Mike, if I look at the 1Q performance and if I layer in the guidance that you guys gave by quarter and then the full year, it looks like your front half margin flowthrough is negative, maybe roughly 3%. And it looks like your second half guidance implies a flowthrough much higher, maybe like 18%. I'm just wondering if that math is correct. And should we interpret that most of your investment spend is front end-loaded here in 2012?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Charles. In terms of the math you did, I'm not going to comment on the exact math. But I think it's fair to say what we're seeing is the continuation of the accelerated investment which began in the back half of last year and will continue through the front half of this year. And in addition, the fact that we had some additional expense last year due to the free shipping, free returns. So we definitely believe that our back half performance is going to be stronger from an earnings standpoint.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a little bit of confusion still on the Street with regards to that slide you guys did in February. Can you flesh out for us a little bit kind of how you think the investment pattern is going to flow as you move from this year to 2013 and beyond?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, I think I would just clarify that the purpose of the slide was to directionally give you a sense of how we were thinking about the overall growth opportunities in front of us. And keep in mind that it was what we thought at that point in time, and we're going to continue to take advantage of every opportunity we see to grow this business in a profitable way. I think what we were trying to depict here is the fact that 2012 saw a step change at an accelerating moment of investment. And that we would expect that, that would fuel future sales and achieve the mid-teens ROIC that we've been talking about for a while. So the idea there was not to be an absolute depiction of exactly where we're going to be. But I think directionally, that we expect that these investments are going to help us achieve our long-term goals.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","My first question is about the women's business. I wondered if you had given any thought to adjusting the allocation of space but with your underperforming departments or if you're thinking of adding any new departments. And then I wondered where you are in hiring a GMM.","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. Yes. I think it's appropriate for us to always be looking at space and how we could be most effective. If you look over the last 5 to 10 years, we've had really good growth in our accessory division, in the shoe division and the cosmetic division. And you know those are all in the first floor typically so this puts a squeeze a little bit on that floor. Women's typically is on 2 or 3. So it isn't super easy to adjust the space that way. But we continue to find ways to add more energy and productivity to our second and third floors. And you may have noticed that one of the things that we've done is we've started a trend accessory department over the last year or 2, and we've got those in and amongst the women apparel departments, and those have been successful. We've also had pretty good growth in active apparel recently and in lingerie. And in many cases, that's taking up some more space. So it's just an ongoing balancing act for us to try to reconcile the space to be most efficient. And so it's nothing really new, but I think to answer your question is yes, we're continuing to work on that. And what was the second part, Jennifer?","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","Where are you in hiring somebody as far as to head up women's?","Peter E. Nordstrom","We're still working on that. That's been going on for a while. We've been obviously vetting the internal candidates that we have, and we have some really good ones. But since that the job was open, it seemed like the practical thing to do for us to consider who else might be out there. And that's been really a positive experience for us, that we've met a lot of interesting people that have an interest in Nordstrom. And so we're still going through that process. But certainly, by our next call, we will have named a leader there. I'm confident in that.","Operator","Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Could you give us some color on the HauteLook business, where you're looking for the sales to be this year? And then could you comment on the Brooks Brothers partnership? And then just lastly, quantify the impact of the 53rd week again.","Michael G. Koppel","Okay. Barbara, this is Mike. I'll answer the first and third one, and then I think, Pete, you can get the second one. In terms of HauteLook, our expectations is that we have a plan to do a 50%, 60% sales increase this year. And the company currently is on plan and continues at very, very good momentum. And we continue to be very excited about the opportunities. I will add just another piece of information there. Just recently, the company's been able to surpass the 8 million mark in terms of the number of members to the business. And so we continue to be really excited. In terms of the 53rd week impact, it's roughly a $0.03 to $0.05 impact for that period. And then I think the second question was on Brooks Brothers.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes. That's going well. They're good partners. I think we're still in the early part of that relationship. And I think a big part of that is them understanding more about our customer and what's going to work for us and us having appreciation of the things that have made their brand successful over the years. So we started someplace, and I think obviously, what that has shown us is that we have more to learn from each other. But it's a good collaborative partnership. I think we have every reason to be hopeful about where it's going to take us. And I would say the early read has been promising.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I don't know if I missed this, but did we talk about why we moved the Anniversary Sale? I'm just wondering what the strategic decision was behind that, kind of shifting it. And maybe related to that, too, would just be how are you planning on maybe focusing on that Fashion Rewards opportunity maybe a little bit more intentionally than we even saw last year to kind of build on the momentum that you guys have already gained in success there?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Erik, you want to comment on the timing of the anniversary?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Sure. It's actually not anything unusual. Because we always want to start on a Friday, each year, it gets 1 day or 2 days earlier, depending on leap year. So we have had this timing before. Eventually, we have to drop it back a week, and we did that this year. So it causes some problems with the quarter, but it is something we've done before.","Michael G. Koppel","Okay. And Neely, in terms of Fashion Rewards, we still have the same program as we had last year as it relates to anniversary in that Fashion Rewards customers have that exclusive opportunity to shop earlier. We're going to continue to find ways to expand that. So more customers can shop earlier that are rewards customers and the benefits that go along with that. So we continue to be excited about that program. And also the fact that it is now attached to the Rack allows it to even impact more customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the question on the women's business. We've heard a couple of your competitors mention that traditional or classic women's is starting to pick back up. Can you just talk about how that business is going for you and any initiatives you have to turn it positive?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. Yes, our women's performance on the whole has been kind of challenging. But there's always been some pockets that have worked pretty well. For us, what's tending to do better is kind of more of the modern casual side of our offer. But I guess, obviously that's relative to where we've been in the past as well. I think there's some good pockets of success in more of the classic part. But I wouldn't characterize it as some kind of a shift in the customer preference. That's not what we're seeing as much. I think most of the momentum for us is kind of pushing us more towards modern.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the gross margin guidance for the second quarter, I assume there's some moving around, given the Anniversary Sale. X those shifts, would it be similar to 2Q?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Real quick on your prepared remarks, I think you said that turns slowed slightly but would pick up in the back half of the year. I guess, with the strong pull-forward and the good weather, I thought maybe turns would even pick up a little. Could you just give us a little more color on why they maybe slowed and why they would pick up at the back half of the year?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, Paul, this is Mike. That was built into our plans as it relates to the expansion, both we're seeing with the new stores that we've opened in the Rack as well as the expansion we're experiencing in Direct. And last year, at this time, as we came out of the end of the previous year and to the first quarter, we were slightly under, and we recognized that. And so the combination of our position last year and the accelerating growth we're seeing right now, that was built into our plans. But our goal is for the year, as we get through this period, that we will be ahead of last year's turn by the end of the year.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just on a unit basis, are you actually a little lighter on units but maybe up on the dollar inventory a little more?","Michael G. Koppel","No, I don't think that's the case.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then real quick, I know you guys disclosed return on capital. As you do all this new investment in technology, obviously more of it is expensed than capitalized or a portion of it is expensed. Is that maybe affecting your return on capital? And should we be, in fact, thinking about some of those as assets instead of expenses?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, actually in the short run, it's affecting more of our P&L than our return. It affects the return on capital in the sense that it depresses the P&L. But long run, you'll actually see capital on a comparative to what we used to do. On building stores, the capital will grow at a slower rate but the P&L won't to be as rich because more of that money goes through the P&L.","Operator","Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Caris & Company.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask if you could give a little bit more color on the kinds of things you're doing with the mobile units to increase functionality. And whether for before anniversary, as you did last year, there'd be a significant increase in the number of them out there, or in the new functionality that you're offering. Or is that something we should see more towards year end?","Michael G. Koppel","Erik, do you want to...","Erik B. Nordstrom","Sure, I'll take that. We are continuing to add functionality to the year. We're at about 75% of the functionality of a register is on our mobile devices right now. By the end of year, we will be at 100%. And next year, we'll actually have additional functionality that we don't even have on the registers. So we are not adding a big chunk of the mobile devices before anniversary this year. We look to test some more -- I mean, not really test, but to roll out more in the fourth quarter. And then once we hit full functionality, we will plan on having a big rollout at that time.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","So that would be next year.","Erik B. Nordstrom","First quarter of '13, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Just first point of clarification on the guidance for credit SG&A, so the $44 million in Q1, that was just because you had the $10 million sort of reversal. Is that correct in terms of bad debt?","Michael G. Koppel","That's correct.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the balance of the year, a little bit higher than the run rate x that reversal. But just some conservatism or...","Michael G. Koppel","It's consistent with the -- the only difference between what we shared last quarter and this quarter is the $10 million change in the reserve. There's no real change in the pattern of spending there than what we thought a quarter ago.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my other question is just I'm sure you saw this article in The New York Times the other day about Amazon's big push into fashion and mentioned a bunch of things like they're going to hire 3 people to just try on size 8 shoes so they can give customer reviews, that kind of thing. Obviously, they've got a huge amount of cash so that they can do some of these things. What do you really think, as you look at yourself versus Amazon, what are your -- what are the things that you have that they don't have in this category, the ways that you feel like as a brick-and-mortar retailer, you can kind of shine, that they can't?","James F. Nordstrom","This is Jamie. That's a good question. I'm hesitant to talk about what competitors are doing. But I'll tell you that we're really focused on serving customers on their terms. We've been focused for a long time on our goal of improving customer service and we realize that now and going forward that how customers define service is changing, and a lot of that is going online, it's mobile. It's about, as Mike said, speed and convenience. So we're making a lot of investments as you see in our capabilities around those areas. And we think that we've got a good opportunity with our team here to build some capabilities to be able to serve customers in the kind of ways that they want to be served. And we want to be known as a place that gives great service. And that's pretty important to us.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez from Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just thinking back to Chuck's question, and sorry if I missed the answer or if it was asked this way. But should we be thinking any differently about the guidance that you gave last quarter for F'13 EBIT dollars to grow faster than sales?","Michael G. Koppel","No.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","That's still the plan.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got you. And also, can you just maybe talk a little bit about the profitability of the Rack division year-over-year in the first quarter?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, we don't normally break out the profitability of the Rack. But what I will say is the Rack continues to be a terrific opportunity for us to deploy capital. We're continuing to grow at roughly 15 stores a year. We have not seen a marginal or any kind of deterioration in the incremental stores that we're opening in terms of their performance. So we continue to be very excited about that.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if I look at the e-commerce growth at 44% this quarter, I have to assume that's faster than what you guys expected even in the quarter, that's a strong result. And even after the big step-up that you gave us on spending to fuel the e-commerce side of the business, if you see the e-commerce business keep growing at this pace, would anything stop you from increasing the SG&A further in 2013 or beyond to maintain this pace of growth there?","James F. Nordstrom","Yes, in terms of what our expectations are, I think we've shared with you -- this is Jamie, by the way -- that we have big ambitions for our online business. And so we think we're in the very early innings of this channel still, even though we've been doing this for a while. We think that there's a lot of opportunity to capture a lot more customers and grow a lot more. So well, yes, the number is big. We think we should be growing in that general area. In terms of SG&A, as we've talked about, we are ramping up right now. Going back to fourth quarter, as we've shared, we're acquiring a lot of talent. A lot of the capabilities that we want to add to be better in e-commerce, sometimes boils down to just having people, the right people, more of them. We are adding a lot more people to the team. That's happening now. That will end. And so SG&A beyond the first half of this year should definitely be a slower growth rate than we're currently experiencing.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I'm kind of reflecting back on the $1 billion in e-commerce in multiyear, 5-year. Does that -- do you envision that as eventually including a separate Rack website, online flash sales through there, like some other soft lines have been doing?","James F. Nordstrom","There's a lot of potential there. We're really focused on listening to our customers, and they're telling us where we're going to go. I think as we've gotten better at testing and trying things, we're learning a lot faster about what customers like and what they don't. And that's going to lead us where we go, both in terms of our stores and e-commerce. So hard to speculate on what it looks like 5 years from now, but we think the potential's pretty darn big.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Drbul from Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Joan Payson standing in for Bob today. So just in terms of your gross margin in the first quarter, down 30 basis points, what was the contribution from the merchandise margins embedded in that?","Michael G. Koppel","Merchandise margin was roughly flat to last year. As I said in the remarks, it was predominantly related from Fashion Rewards and from free shipping, free returns.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then also in terms of your second quarter comp store sales guidance, that low double-digit increase, what do you expect directionally on a monthly basis, just given the shifts in Mother's Day and Anniversary Sale?","Michael G. Koppel","We normally don't guide on a monthly basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Jacob Zitter from Robert W. Baird.","Jacob Zitter - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you discuss the drivers behind the strength in comps at Rack this quarter? Have you been able to improve your buy into that channel? I know you're thinking about trying to leverage your full-line relationships a little more. Or is that acceleration more a function of the customer service enhancements?","Michael G. Koppel","Blake, you want to take that, please?","Blake W. Nordstrom","I'm sorry, one more time, I didn't hear the question.","Jacob Zitter - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just the drivers behind the strength in comps at Rack, have you been able to leverage some of your full-line relationships? Or is it more customer service enhancements at the store level?","Blake W. Nordstrom","That's a good question. There really is a synergy between the 2. And that really was from our inception way back in the early '70s, when we had a Rack in the basement of our downtown Seattle store. And since then, we have just continued to see a really healthy relationship. The closer we can have a Rack to successful full-line store is really beneficial for both. And when we opened that down -- or relocated that downtown Seattle Rack, in addition to the reopening figures, across the street, the downtown Seattle full-line store enjoyed some really healthy gains. And so there is customer movement back and forth. There's an acquisition subject. That's also true with employees from a career path. So at this point, as Mike said earlier, we're really pleased with the Rack and its growth plans and continue to support it.","Operator","Our next question is from David Glick from Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a follow-up on the Rack and then a merchandise question for Pete. In the past, before you started to expand the Rack a little more significantly, you used to talk about a maximum number of stores that you might consider. Now that the number of Rack stores is going to end up a bit greater than the number of full-line stores at the end of this year, as you look out at your multiyear plans, is there kind of a maximum number of stores that you envision? Do you reach a point where you risk cannibalization? Second question, Pete, do you still see enough innovation and strong enough trends in center core to continue those really strong trends, which have been a huge driver for you and others in the industry? Or do you have to count on some other areas to drive the same kind of comps you've been driving overall?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, this is Blake. On the Rack question, we have over the years kind of evolved our thinking about that balance of our merchandise offering. And we're very sensitive to the integrity of our pricing and to those goods. We've been very pleased with the relationship that we have with our vendors to get terrific access to our top vendors and top items. And so what I think is important to note, though we may at the end of this year be crossing from a physical store count, our e-commerce business is so robust that when you put the 2 together from a percentage-wise, the Rack is staying pretty constant. So the big driver, and it's not dissimilar to what Jamie said earlier about our e-commerce, is the customer is dictating this growth and they are very supportive. And that's reflected in the results with our execution in the Rack. And so if we're able to continue to get great product from our vendors in great locations, we're going to continue to grow this way.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And on the merchandise classification question, Pete?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes. You know what, it's actually one of the great things about working in our industry is that hope springs eternal. So regardless of what merchandise division you're talking to at any given time, they're always excited about what's coming next. And the vendors obviously start that and our buying people, they're part of that as well. So it's usually an issue about trying to reel them in, in terms of how much they want to spend rather than are there good things to go out there and buy. So I think if you were to take a general assessment of our confidence in finding great things for our customers going forward, I think it's high. There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to deliver compelling fashion for our customers.","Operator","And our final question today is from Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Quick question on inventory on hand and the inventory build we should anticipate for the summer sale, the Anniversary Sale. You seem a little heavy today. Just numerically, I'm wondering, do we need to get through that to reposition the inventories for the holiday sale? Or are you already shipping some of the anniversary product early?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, I think, Richard, the point we indicated earlier, there was a couple of factors there. One was just the overall acceleration of the pace of the business on the whole in the aggregate and within the channels. And the second was the fact that last year, we're a little light in the first quarter. So this isn't really, I don't think, a reaction or a response to the upcoming sale in terms of anything that would be out of the ordinary cadence. And you should see actually, coming out of the second quarter, inventories will be slightly higher because of the fact that we have 1 more week of Anniversary Sale going into the third quarter. But in terms of our overall business, other than those fiscal cutoffs, it's pretty much in line as to where it should be.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And I guess, a follow-on to the e-commerce business, the opportunity obviously to accelerate the Rack business to reflect the growth at the full-line stores or the growth you've talked about for HauteLook, any thoughts about an off-price venue online, a more robust off-price venue?","James F. Nordstrom","Sure. Well, this is Jamie. We do have an off-price online business, it's HauteLook. And as Mike mentioned earlier, it's grown about 60% this year and we're ahead of plan there. So we're feeling pretty good about our positioning there. We do get asked a lot, is there a more traditional off-price model that works online? And we're looking for one. And if you look across the industry of the people we compete directly with in our Rack business, there's not a lot of e-commerce going on there. And there's a reason for that. It's not obvious how you would do that. The flash sale business has gone from 0 to almost $2 billion now in just a few years. And we're competing there. And so far, we're pretty pleased with our growth.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call.

As we take a moment to reflect on 2013, it was a year in which customers clearly demonstrated their increasing desire for speed and convenience, whether online or in stores.","It also was a year in which the impact of e-commerce became more apparent in terms of customers' broader acceptance and usage to research, to transact and to facilitate purchases across channels.","If anything, the pace of change is accelerating faster than we anticipated a year ago.","For example, with estimates of nearly 200 million mobile devices in the U.S. today, they rapidly have become an integral part of consumers' everyday lives. It strongly validates the strategic path we embarked on nearly a decade ago in laying the foundation by making investments to provide a differentiated customer experience in a multichannel environment.","We believe there is tremendous value in having a platform for serving customers that encompasses full price and off-price, in-store and online. Each of these channels represents substantial opportunity individually. There also is significant potential in the way they can work together in creating a unique customer experience, with enablers such as product, loyalty, technology and personalization that we are utilizing across channels.","We made substantial progress in many ways during the year. Our Direct business finished its third consecutive year of at least 30% top line growth. A key driver was increased merchandise selection, which grew 30% this year, after expanding by 50% a year ago.","1 million new customers were acquired via our online business, similar to 2012. We saw mobile and tablet usage continue to grow. We offered more recommendations based on purchase history, and we increased the speed of fulfillment and delivery.","As our online business expands, we're increasing our capacity to enable a greater service experience. Last fall, we doubled our daily fulfillment capacity to 300,000 units. More recently, we opened a fulfillment center in San Bernardino to serve HauteLook and the Rack. And last month, we announced plans for a fulfillment center on the East Coast. By 2015, we'll have 3x the capacity we had in 2012.","In the Rack, we're serving more customers in existing stores and in the 22 stores that opened during the year, which contributed to a 12% increase in total sales. Collectively, our new store performance is in line with our expectations, and our total Rack sales productivity remains strong at $550 per square foot.","Our integration with HauteLook has increased, an example of which is the ability to return HauteLook merchandise to any of our Rack locations.","Today, a good portion of HauteLook returns come to a Rack store. This drives thousands of customers to the Rack each week. And of those making a return, many leave with a Rack purchase.","In addition, as of a few months ago, the Rack can fulfill the demand in one store through the inventory in another and deliver it to the customer. This feature mirrors the service we've offered in our full-line stores for a number of years.","Our full-line store sales fell short of expectations, but we have ongoing initiatives around product, service and the store environment to elevate the customer experience.","Our plan to enhance our relevance with existing and new customers in part was demonstrated in our Women's Apparel business, which continued to experience positive momentum during the year.","We expanded Topshop to 41 stores from 14 at the start of the year and repositioned our Savvy department to offer on-trend fashion at more accessible price points. Both have attracted new and younger customers, while reflecting newness in fashion that have a halo effect across the entire offering.","Recent remodels have created energy through a more clean and updated look. They've established more flexible floor space that enable us to respond more quickly to emerging trends while allowing for more continuous shopping between departments.","The ongoing evolution of retail is exciting, with the accelerated growth of e-commerce, the continuing importance of stores and the increasing customer interaction between channels. As this unfolds, we're taking steps to ensure that our allocation of capital is aligned with our growth.","We're also making adjustments to better support our multichannel growth strategy and achieve greater execution.","As we turn to 2014, we anticipate considerable progress across multiple fronts: first, enhance the full-line store experience with ongoing efforts around product, service and store environment; open 3 full-line stores including Calgary, our first store in Canada, which will open in September, along with Jacksonville and a second store in Houston; offer even greater selection online with an increased level of personalization; open 27 Rack stores and continue to find opportunities for further integration with HauteLook; finally, apply greater focus on building synergies in our multichannel platform through leveraging our shared assets such as loyalty, technology and marketing.","We strongly believe in the customer strategy we're in the midst of executing. We're focused squarely on improving the customer experience and the sustainable platform for long-term profitable growth that it's enabling.","We're encouraged by the progress we've achieved to date and the multiple opportunities ahead of us. We look forward to keeping you updated as we go throughout the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. Before commenting on our financial performance, I'd like to reinforce comments Blake made around the accelerated pace of change.","It's very clear that advancements in technology, and specifically in e-commerce, are redefining the customer experience across all channels. It's happening at a pace that's even faster than we anticipated a year ago.","In one sense, it increases our confidence in the strategic path forward and validates our efforts to provide our customers a best-in-class experience, both in-store and online and through our full-price and off-price channels.","It also reminds us that speed is important while being flexible enough to make adjustments as we respond to customers' heightened expectations.","Turning to our financial performance. Our full year earnings per diluted share of $3.71 exceeded our prior outlook of $3.65 to $3.70 and fell within the range of our initial annual guidance of $3.65 to $3.80 that we provided a year ago. These results included a nonrecurring charge of $14 million or $0.04 in earnings per diluted share related to our recent debt transaction that lowered our overall cost of borrowing and extended maturity.","Additionally, we delivered return on invested capital of 13.6%, while increasing our capital investments by over 50% this year. We achieved a milestone with over $12 billion in sales, representing an increase of 4.9% over last year when adjusting for the 53rd week in 2012.","Same-store sales increased 2.5% for the year, which was consistent with our prior outlook but below our annual plan. The impact of softer top line trends was mitigated by consistent execution throughout the year in inventory and expenses.","As we exit the year, our inventory is at an appropriate level, reflecting planned investments to fuel growth in stores and online.","Next, I'd like to talk about our path forward. We believe strongly in the customer strategy we're currently implementing and its ability to generate long-term, top-quartile shareholder returns. We've stated that as a result of our planned growth, with anticipated double-digit increases in depreciation and rent in the near term, we don't expect EBIT margin expansion over the next several years. However, EBITDAR, which excludes these components, is expected to grow roughly in line with sales. This provides a clear indication of our underlying performance, and together with total sales growth and ROIC, are markers for continued value creation.","In our efforts to serve existing and new customers, we expect roughly half of our sales to come from our online and Rack businesses over the next several years compared to 38% today. As our business model evolves with growing volume across a number of channels, our financial model needs to evolve as well. There are dynamics associated with our growth in each channel that I'd like to touch on briefly.","First, we expect our online business to remain our fastest-growing channel, generating high EBIT growth and returns. The outside sales growth demonstrated over the past several years in part reflects benefits from the investments we've been making. We plan to continue elevating the customer experience online and able through investments in our technology platform, fulfillment capabilities and personalization.","With the Rack, which achieved high sales productivity, EBIT margins and returns, we plan to grow this business from 140 stores today to roughly 230 stores by 2016.","During this time, approximately 40% of the Rack store base will have opened in the past 3 years. In the near term, this accelerated pace of store expansion will result in higher occupancy expenses as a percent of sales in addition to the impact of greater preopening rent expense.","With full-line stores, we anticipate moderating sales trends with fewer store openings. In response, we are focusing on opportunities to improve our 4-Wall productivity, as well as making adjustments to our remodel strategy.","And finally, with respect to Canada, we are beginning with 6 full-line stores. We believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion sales opportunity with value-creating returns. Achieving this requires meaningful infrastructural investments. As a result, we expect this business to remain EPS dilutive for several years until we reach necessary scale.","While these channels present various operating dynamics, we believe our enterprise assets, such as our loyalty program, marketing and technology, will serve to create a customer experience that leverages all channels.","Our financial position remains strong. For 5 consecutive years, we've generated cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion while maintaining a balance of reinvesting in the business and returning value to shareholders.","Part of the financial model evolution includes revising the allocation of capital investments to more closely align with our growth.","Our capital plan of $3.9 billion for 2014 through 2018 represents a substantial increase from the $2.2 billion of the previous 5-year period and reflects the aggressive online and store growth we anticipate.","Technology investments account for over 30% of our plan, up from roughly 20% historically. Stores continue to represent the core of our brand. We are finding ways to reinvest that allows stores to be refreshed more efficiently by letting the customer experience rather than the age of the store drive the process. With this approach, we believe we can significantly reduce our remodel investment per square foot while enhancing the overall store environment.","Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2014 outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.75 to $3.90 incorporates expected total sales growth of 5.5% to 7.5%. We are planning a same-store sales increase of 2% to 4% based on our current trends. This assumes a low- to mid-single-digit increase on a multichannel basis, reflecting consistent trends at full-line stores and roughly a 25% increase at Direct and HauteLook and a low-single-digit increase in the Rack with total sales growth in the mid-teens.","Other considerations include the impact of our initial entry into Canada, for which we estimate an EBIT loss of approximately $35 million, primarily representing our infrastructure investments and pre-opening costs.","Our 2014 outlook also includes the acceleration of Rack store growth and increased technology investments to improve service and experience across all channels. These investments are contributing to our overall depreciation and rent expense growth of approximately 14% in 2014.","Please also refer to the earnings release for timing considerations contemplated in our outlook, including additional color on expected first quarter performance.","We look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Elan, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is from Jessica Schmidt from KeyBanc.","Jessica Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Jessica on for Ed. Can you just talk about the changes, if any, that you've made to your at once inventory purchases? Have you decreased your percent of inventory that you purchased through preorders, I guess, leaving more open to buys during the season? And then how should we think about your inventory strategy going forward?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, Jessica, this is Mike. In terms of our overall inventory strategy going forward, we continue to look for opportunities to improve the turns in order to assure that we have new receipts and fresh product available to our customers. In addition, we've made some relatively aggressive changes to our plans in the Rack, where we've gone out and purchased inventory at an advantageous way in order to drive business in subsequent seasons. So we expect to continue to look for those opportunities, and in addition, increasing the assortments online. So from an overall strategic point of view, that's what we plan. In terms of your specific question, I'm...","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, Mike, this is Blake. I just would add that from an aging point of view as well, we measured that closely through your team and we have not seen any material change. And that a matter of fact, our inventories are as current and as fresh as they've been in the past, and so we're encouraged by that.","Michael G. Koppel","Okay.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Yes, does that answer your question? Because I'm not sure I understand maybe what else you were asking.","Jessica Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think that, that answers it. I'll pass on.","Operator","Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is on the channel shift that seems to be happening between the full-line stores and e-commerce. Obviously, the e-commerce growth of 30% last year was really fantastic. Full-line comps down 2.1%. It looks like the net between the 2 is a small increase. But I'm wondering if maybe you can just sort of step back and talk to us about this financial implication of -- on the operating margin of this channel shift. And then I just had one clarification on one of your earlier comments as a follow-up.","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Kim, this is Mike. In terms of the \"channel shift,\" I just want to start by saying we still look at this as a customer strategy and not necessarily a strategy that's focused around individual channels in our business. But that being said, the reality is both channels do operate different. The stores tend to be much more capital intensive, have a higher fixed cost and require certain levels of sales to leverage that fixed cost where the direct channel has a much more variable cost model. And so clearly, on the way up, it does generate more cost. But it also, on the way down, when it softens, it also gives some of that back. So that being said is we believe that we have opportunities to improve the productivity in our 4-Wall model, particularly full-line. We touched on that a little bit in terms of some of the changes we're making in our remodel strategy. And we're also looking at ways that we can improve the productivity within those stores.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's super helpful. And just a clarification, you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks that you don't expect operating margin expansion over the next several years. I'm wondering, is that using 2013 as sort of a baseline year or 2014 as your baseline year?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, I would say it's -- we're assuming 2014 because that's the current year that we're talking about.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black","I wondered if you could quantify the impact of the recent change you made in your Fashion Rewards program as far as alterations. It seems like it could be significant as far as driving traffic across channels. And do you think customers understand the strategy? I mean, I know I understand it. Some people thought they're losing a benefit, but it seems like it could be really beneficial. And then I have a follow-up on Activewear.","Michael G. Koppel","Well, yes, Jennifer. This is Mike. I mean, basically, that change was a result of a couple of things. We were looking at the overall economics and the offer to the customer, as well as trying to make it more convenient. But that being said, we have heard back from our customers about that change, and we're evaluating it and trying to best understand what would be the best product and benefits that we can offer. But in terms of significant change in traffic, at this point, we don't see anything driving additional. That being said, last year, we did add another 1 million new accounts to our Nordstrom Rewards program, and we accelerated the penetration to over 38% of our business. So we're still seeing some pretty good growth in that loyalty program.","Jennifer Black","Well, you have an awesome program. My follow-up is on Activewear, which is one of the fastest growing categories across the board and Zella looks amazing. And I just wondered what you're doing to capitalize on the lifestyle shift that's been occurring over the last couple of years. I saw that you've introduced Zella PRO. Are you going to expand the department and categories? Are you adding line extensions? Are you thinking about Men's? Just anything you could say would be great.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. I think we're happy with the momentum and the trajectory we have in Active. And you're right, it's a good classification, and there certainly is an opportunity in Men's as well. And I think you'll see that will increase our inventory ownership in active-type products. We're definitely trying to figure out how to update our -- the environment with the active department so that it definitely has a stand-alone feel and lets customers know that we're serious about being in that business in the year-round way, which is we've done for a long, long time. But I think that we continue just to stay close to it. And like all our departments that we have, we try to give them the opportunity to grow when that opportunity exists in whatever classification. And so yes, I think active is something that we're definitely confident with. And Zella, which you mentioned in particular, one of our MPG brands, has done super well. We plan on growing that further this next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I'm encouraged by the strength in more contemporary Women's Apparel. But could you talk about if anything is going on in more classic clothes? What's going on in Brass Plum? And then also, could you comment on the strength of casual versus more dressed-up looks?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. I think related to what would be kind of more of an updated kind of classic-type look, not just pure contemporary, interestingly for us, our studio department had a really, really good year and that is bridged-price-point-type clothes but more leaning towards classic, as you called it, styling. And that did almost nearly as well as the individuals department, which features more of the contemporary brand. So I think a lot of it is about where we have strong national branded representation in our stores. If we can get behind that in a meaningful way, customers are really responding strongly to brands. And that's been the case in both individuals and the studio area. I think just generally across the board with Women's, everything feels like it needs to be evolving and made more modern, even if it's more classic in nature. When we've been able to do that, been good for the business all the way around. I'm sorry, and the rest of the parts of your question?","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","About Brass Plum, what's going on there?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, BP, our Women's Junior area, that continued to be difficult. It's an ongoing thing for us. I think there's some environmental things we can improve on and the in-store experience, the customer experience there. We've tried a lot of things. And we definitely have, we think, an improved way of executing. And then in terms of product, the good news is, is that all turns pretty quickly. And we have a really good team there and they feel confident we're going to have some improvement. If you look at just the trajectory of where we've been while the business has been difficult, it is moving in the right direction. So I think we're encouraged that it's going to improve, but it's still, even at this time, on the -- towards the bottom for us. And then lastly, the other one was what?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Casual versus dressed up.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Casual versus dressed up. Well, I think the customer places a lot of value on versatile clothes and being able to have things work for multiple occasions. So I think things that are dressed up for the sake of being dressed up may be what we would have classified in the past as like wear-to-work clothes. That's -- it's just kind of a different story today, particularly in Women's. I think there's a lot more flexibility. When we can bring things in that have some flexibility for someone's job or lifestyle or whatever they're doing, that's when we seem to do best.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Grom from Sterne Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just on the commentary regarding the first quarter sales. Should we expect comps to be up, say, flat to up 2%? And then just on the fourth quarter, I'm just wondering if you could share how the quarter-to-date shook out across channels?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, yes. Chuck, this is Mike. Yes, you're right in your numbers. Q1 looks like it's roughly flat to 2% comp overall, the way we've calendarized that out. And in terms of the holiday period, we definitely had, I would say, better than trend sales in the month of November and in the first half of December. Sales started to soften up around the holiday and it continued soft post-Holiday and through January.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on a follow-up, Mike, just gross profit margins down the past couple of years. How should we think about that over the next 2 years? It seemed -- there seem to be some pressure points from promotional activities and certainly from the Rack. Should we expect margins to be down in the next couple of years, gross margins?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, we don't normally give outlook beyond the current year we're talking about. But I think it's safe to say when you look at the -- at where the growth in our business is coming from, particularly with the Rack, Rack tends to have a lower merchandise margin and a lower operating expense. And so you're seeing a geographical shift there. And we've also seen a little bit of pressure over the last probably 2 years from the loyalty program, where you see the cost of that program ends up in our -- in cost of goods sold. So those would be probably the 2 most significant ones. In terms of the promotion, while that had some impact, it really hasn't been, I would say, materially measurable compared to those other 2 components.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was wondering if you guys can enlighten us a little bit more on some of your mobile strategy for 2014. We obviously saw the HauteLook-developed Rack app from this fall but it's not yet commerce enabled. Kind of what are you thinking there? And then can we see some further elevation on your smartphone app to really integrate, I think, better the loyalty with -- for your core customer in the core Nordstrom app?","Michael G. Koppel","Jamie, can you take that question, please?","James F. Nordstrom","Yes, sure. Neely, this is Jamie. I think we're focused on mobile quite a bit right now. It's definitely increasing the terms of the amount of traffic we're getting as well as in our sales. What's interesting for us is that we've got a lot of customers right now who are only interacting with our brand because they're new to our brand or they're younger through their phone. We've got to make sure that the experience they have with us through their phone is a good one. So we're investing a lot in that. You're going to see some pretty big improvements to our mobile site later this spring we'll be rolling out. And yes, we've been learning a lot through our off-sale -- or sorry, our off-price business in terms of how customers want to use their phones to shop. And so we're putting a lot of those ideas to work, and we're pretty encouraged by a lot of those investments so far.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just given the accelerated growth in the Rack, can you provide any detail on how these stores mature across sales and profitability on a 4-Wall basis?","Michael G. Koppel","They tend to reach the maturity curve somewhere in the 3- to 4-year range.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so that will be both sales and profitability?","Michael G. Koppel","No, I would say profitability over time tends to leverage as you start to work through the upfront costs of the store buildout and some of those other fixed costs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just as we think about CapEx longer term, you did mention that e-commerce should ultimately be a lower capital cost. And it looks like you'll be spending -- you'll be over the spending hump as it relates to the prior 5-year outlook. So how should we be thinking about CapEx beyond this year?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, in terms of the 5-year cadence, clearly, the next couple of years will be the peak years. And what's driving the -- a big portion of that really is the investment in Canada with the rollout of the 6 stores in Canada and then some of the buildup in Manhattan. Technology also for the, I would say, the first roughly 2 to 3 years of the plan is, from what we can see today, is at its peak level. But I think we have to be cautious in that things are changing. There's a lot of newness that keeps coming out. And our line of sight in that world is really only roughly a 2- to 3-year period. And so to say that we're going to reach a peak and then it's going to stop, I think, would be misleading on our part.","Operator","Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding your callout on the promotional environment that we've seen in the marketplace, has that dynamic let up as you look forward? And also, the promotional markdowns in terms of increased markdowns, is that across different banners that you had? Or where was that focused? The follow-up for me is on the full-line comps and the trends there. Does your guidance incorporate a continuation of what you're seeing now?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I think it's fair to say that the increased promotional activity that happened in December was more than we had expected and an area of concern for us going forward. And there are some things that we can do to mitigate that, given our ability to have relative exclusives with the brands that we operate with, our own branded product, which is a growing part of our business. But it's a world that we live in. And with the way that Direct works now and all the information available to customers, if something is online and it's marked down and it's available to everybody, then we got to be competitive everywhere, too, particularly given the fact that we've got a completely aligned and synergistic merchandise strategy between Direct and in-store. So yes, it's a real issue. And I think that we -- it's given us an opportunity to partner with our large vendors more and talk about that. And it's a sensitive subject as you might anticipate. But yes, it's definitely of concern for us. We don't -- I guess I would say about that, we don't have any increased plans around promotion. But we will continue as we've always had a philosophy around not being undersold on the exact same product. And I think it's important that we're transparent with our vendors and with customers about that.","Michael G. Koppel","And Oliver, on the second part of your question on full-line comps, the guidance does take into account current trends through the first quarter of this year and then we expect some improvement as the year progresses.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You mentioned that Canada, I believe the dilution was about $35 million or so expected for '14 to the EBIT line, up from the $14 million this past year. Just as we go forward and you open up additional doors, how should we think about the direction of that impact to the P&L?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, directionally, over the next roughly 3 years, as we're opening the new stores, we should see that impact grow. And then as we get to the point where we're fully comping those stores, we'll start to see it become accretive.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to follow up on a comment you just made on the full-line stores. You mentioned -- if you can just give me a little bit more detail around some of your in-store initiatives there. I just visited one of your newly remodeled stores in Tampa that looked very good. Could you speak some of the expected returns from these investments you're making to improve the full-line doors?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Erik, can you take that question, please?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Sure. Well, I would, first of all, reiterate an earlier comment that the first thing we would look at is the customer strategy, how do we serve the customer best, which may sound obvious but it's easy to get stuck into protecting one channel versus the other. Channel is something -- I've never heard a customer use the word channel. They want the experience they want. We have great assets online. We have great assets in our stores, and our opportunity -- our challenge is to leverage those assets to serve the customer better. For stores, I think you can bucket our efforts into 3: one is product; two is the in-store experience; and three, the environment. And it's briefly around products. You touched on some of them. We have momentum in Women's Apparel, the changes of adding Topshop, changing Savvy has allowed our mix -- total Women's business to be much more compelling and we're on a good path on that one. We've also been focusing on tentpole brands, big national brands, all through our stores that not only having more breadth and depth with them but highlighted them more to ease the navigation in our store so customers understand these brands. They understand how our stores are organized better. The in-store experience, there's services where we must win and that certainly includes our traditional high-touch approach, things like our get connected program. Our personal stylists, which we've talked about for a couple of years now, continue to grow. We still have unmet demand with customers who want to be served at a very high touch way and that's a good fit for us. But a lot of it is changing. Some of it's technology. We've been rolling out what would be awesome [ph] devices. We have tablets to make our POS completely mobile. This gives us much more functionality and security with our customer information. And then I think the real new bucket, the interesting bucket is the synergies with Direct, things like for a couple of years they've been taking online returns in our stores. And even though online returns are free for customers, most customers prefer to bring their online returns to our stores. That's a win for the customer experience and it's a win for us in being more traffic in our stores. We think there's a lot more to be done there. They're really scratching the surface. And ultimately, this could be the field where stores are really [indiscernible] win or loss, that can we, through our store assets, make the online experience better and vice versa? So there's lots going on there. Then lastly, store environment, [indiscernible] that you talked about, we continue to see good lift from our store remodel investments. And actually the last 2 years, our lifts have been a little better than they've historically been. So you mentioned Tampa. We have a number of remodels last year that we've seen very good performance with. In general, I would say that the direction of having more flexibility to our space has helped greatly in showing us these national brands, showing us some of our products and it's helped the customer navigate easier. And it has also helped us to keep our stores fresh. We've added things in some of the bigger stores like pop-up shops and having flexible space allows us to do that. So we still have an investment plan to refresh our stores. As Mike touched on, we need to be more efficient with that and we think we have found ways to do that. We learned some things with last year to where we can update our stores more cost effectively. But we continued to see a nice sales bump from when we do remodel our stores.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On merchandise margins, can you just talk about what the merch margin decline was during the fourth quarter? And I think this might have been asked earlier, I'm not sure if I caught the answer, but what did that look like in full-price versus Rack and even if you can talk about e-comm? And then just a follow-up, can you just remind us what percentage of your stores, full-line stores, are mall versus street locations and how the -- each of those performed?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, Paul, this is Mike. We don't specifically break out merchandise margin from gross profit. But what I will directionally share with you is that the decrease in the gross profit, a portion of that was related to merchandise margin. The other portion was related to the mix and the Rack, as well as the Fashion Rewards program. In terms of breaking it out, most of the -- really all of the pressure in merch margin was from a regular priced business, where we saw most of the promotional activity and that was reflected both in the stores and online, where we tried to maintain consistent pricing and respond consistently across channels. And then I think your other question about mall versus standalone, I mean, other than our major downtown urban stores, most of our full-line store base is all mall based. And as far as drawing any kind of pattern between the sales performances, I don't think there was anything significantly different.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Drbul from Nomura Securities.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just have 2 questions actually. The first one is on the pack and hold inventory at the Rack. Can you just talk about what you're seeing and like the opportunities that are out there and how you're capitalizing on that? And then the second question is, how did the Seahawks' run impact your business in the fourth quarter last year? And how should we think about that for the fourth quarter this year? I'd like to hear your forecast on that.","Blake W. Nordstrom","We need a repeat performance by the Seahawks.","Michael G. Koppel","Well, one of the things they taught us during holiday season was we needed a better defense. Go ahead, Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom","So Bob, this is Blake, and I'll start with the Rack and the pack and hold. That's something that's been -- we've been pleasantly pleased or surprised with on the upside as we have enhanced the Rack store count. One of the things we're extremely sensitive to is the mix and availability of the product that we aspire to carry for our customers. And we've just been able to really enhance the partnership with our top vendors and get first call and get better access and pack and hold is a way to leverage that partnership. And so it enables us to provide the best product and improve flow for the customer. It also is a great facility for us as we opened these new stores, to open a new store with the right content of inventory. So that's been growing with the availability and it's really, really working well. So we give that high marks and we're encouraged by that access and how the customer is responding to it. And the Seahawks, we did benefit, at least here in Seattle, that anything that had Seahawk related to it, gloves, hats or T-shirt sold really well. The flip side to that, when the game itself was on, tough on the business and there was a huge parade that following week, that was a little tough, too. So but overall, the pride in the city of Seattle is terrific and everyone's really excited about the Seahawks.","Operator","Our final question today is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you -- I apologize if I missed this a little bit. But is there any way you could talk a little bit about the gross margin cadence for the year and how we should think about the first quarter? I see the inventory up. I see that it's largely for strategic reasons. But we do know there's more promotional holiday for the industry. I just want to think about maybe the first half of the year versus the back half on the grosses. And then I had a follow-up.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, Michael, we normally don't give that kind of guidance by quarter as it relates to margin. But what I will do is address your question on the inventory levels. And the increase, I think, you're looking at is on a sales per square foot. We're up about 9% in inventory and then sales were up in low-single digits. And there's 2 primary drivers to that. One is what Blake talked about, is the continuing investment in the pack and hold. And the other thing really is a function of timing. You may recall last year was the 53rd week, so we had 5 weeks in the month of January. And the last week of the month, we basically had more reductions to our inventory than we did have adds to the inventory. And so that's kind of a phenomenon that happens with that 53rd week. And so if you look at the period -- the year before and then the period right now, the increases in inventory are roughly the same. So we feel good about it. And as Blake said earlier, our aging is in really good shape. And by the way, the amount of clearance inventory we have right now is the lowest it's been in 5 years, so that's really not an issue for us.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Is there -- can I just follow that up real quickly?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So the -- I think if we think a little bit further out into the year, if I look over the last few years, I'm wondering if there's any change to the strategy related to the annual sale events with the full-price business. And I asked because it hasn't sounded like you've been excited about those events the past few years and commented that's really not what drives excitement for that full-price customer. So as we kind of start getting into the year and start thinking about those events, have you guys changed your thinking about that at all?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I would say, well, we have 2 different events, one is the half-yearly sale, which, obviously, we have 2 of those. And those are kind of a pure clearance event. They have become less and less important to us over the years because we take markdowns in a more timely fashion rather than kind of wait up for a period of time, and that's actually played out really well. If you just look at our margin performance over the year, that's been the right way to do it. So we -- as you probably heard us talk about a lot, the main thrust of our focus is to try to get new products in there and sell at full price. Our customers seem to prefer that and that's what works well for our business. But the markdowns are a reality of just the business that we're in. The other event is the anniversary sale that happens in July. And I would guess on the -- well, not guess, I would tell you for sure on the contrary to why we have kind of the celebrating thing happening at half-yearly clearance sale is the anniversary sale is something that we apply a lot of energy to. Our customers love it. We intend to keep growing it and making it as great as it can possibly be. It's great for our business. We generate a lot of sales during a slow period of time, and customers really love it and it engenders a lot of excitement and loyalty to our business because it's such a great opportunity for them to buy terrific brands at great prices.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to the Investor Relations section of nordstrom.com in. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Erik Nordstrom, Co-President; and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's second quarter performance and outlook for 2019. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, Co-President.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Erik.","Erik Nordstrom","Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered strong bottom-line results, demonstrating our inventory and expense execution. We exited the quarter with inventory levels in a favorable position and made significant strides in productivity. We are implementing key learnings from the quarter to drive our top-line and deliver bottom line results. ","In the second quarter, sales were down 5.1% which was around the low end of our expectations. Full-Price decreased 6.5% and Off-Price decreased 1.9%. We anticipated first quarter trends to continue. However, we have a slow start to the second quarter and softer results on both Full-Price and Off-Price. Last quarter, we emphasized our top line focus related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandizing. We've seen good outcomes from our efforts including improvement in Nordstrom note redemption. From a merchandize perspective, we are improving our in-stock levels and addressing a gap between our opening and higher price points.","We ended the quarter in a strong inventory position giving us the ability to better align our assortment in the second half of the year. Now I'd like to provide insight into two drivers of our business performance. Our Full-Price anniversary sale and our Off-Price business. Starting with anniversary, this is a unique event featuring new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our anniversary strategy focused on three objectives. Increasing customer satisfaction, driving sales and improving the economics of the event. We're seeing early indications that our event resonated well with customers. That said we plan anniversary consistent with current trends, the sales were softer than expected.","Based on customer feedback, we curated our anniversary assortment to highlight their favorite brands which drove higher sell-through of anniversary product relative to last year. We expect this to benefit merchandized margins in the third quarter and we'll have a complete assessment of our overall anniversary results at that time. While we increase depth in top brands, it has become even more concentrated around key items. We did not have enough depth in key items and we are actively addressing this in the second half, particularly with our top gift ideas for the holidays.","During anniversary, we improved our operational metrics around satisfaction scores, delivery times in key markets and site performance. This includes initial survey feedback from our top loyalty customers, who valued the enhanced benefits such as earlier access to merchandize. We also leverage our digital and physical assets through buy-online pick-up in store, which increases customer engagement and is one of our most profitable transactions. During anniversary, sales from order pickup more than doubled over last year with nearly half coming from customers using this service for the first time. Customers who engage through order pickup tend to double their overall spend.","Turning to Off-Price. We are pleased with our profitability results. However, sales fell short of our expectations. Earlier this year, we made changes to improve our bottom line which included reducing less profitable flash events because these events helped drive meaningful traffic to our Nordstrom Rack and Hautelook sites, we are increasing the number of high-quality flash events in the second half. We are also accelerating our marketing efforts to drive traffic such as the upcoming launch of our Nordstrom Rack television brand campaign. The Off-Price business ended the quarter in a strong inventory position improving churns across all merchandise divisions.","As we head into the second half, we are being opportunistic in the marketplace with plans to accelerate forward receipts. In this dynamic retail environment, we are evolving our business to create a seamless shopping journey. Historically, we know that more than a third of customers who place an online order or visited a store to help inform that purchase. And half of our customers who make a purchase in our store or first spent time on one of our digital properties. Our local market strategy leverages our physical and digital assets to provide greater access to merchandise selection. With faster delivery and at a lower cost to us. This strategy focuses on gaining market share in our most important markets by leveraging inventory and increasing customer engagement through the services we offer.","Our business is highly concentrated in our top markets with the Top 10 accounting for 60% of our sales. This year we scale our local market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market. We're seeing compelling results and predictive metrics for customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. We're seeing higher customer engagement and spend at our Nordstrom local neighborhood service hub. Customers spent 2.5 times more on average, this service hub account for 30% of order pickup and alterations increased by more than 10%. In addition, product returns are coming in eight days faster driving greater inventory efficiencies.","To leverage inventory across the broader LA market, we began offering customers up to 7x more selection that's able next day. This contributed to sales from order pickup nearly tripling in July. We are pleased with our results in LA and are accelerating key elements of our local market strategy in more of our top markets. Our next milestone is expanding our presence in New York City, currently our largest market for online sales. This fall, we will significantly expand our presence with the opening of our flagship store and two Nordstrom locals. We anticipate that the combination of our physical and digital assets will drive a meaningful sales lift in this important market.","We will also leverage our seven locations in New York City including Nordstrom Rack, and Trunk Club locations to take care of our customers through services such as returns, order pickup and alterations.","In closing, we're focused on driving our top and bottom line results. And we are well-positioned for the second half. Nordstrom has managed through many cycles and we will continue to evolve our business to better serve customers on their terms, no matter how they choose to shop.","I'll now turn it over Anne to provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook.","Anne Bramman","Thanks Erik. Our second quarter earnings demonstrated our continued inventory and expense discipline. We are in a strong position to rebalance our merchandise assortment with customer demand across price points and key items. We also make significant progress in bending the expense curve, mitigating our sales shortfall. Second quarter sales reflect a consistent traffic trends, while conversion was softer relative to the first quarter. Heading into the second half, we continued to take aggressive action related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise.","Our progress in the second quarter and plans for the second half give us confidence in our ability to turn around our current trend. Beginning with loyalty, we continue to grow the program with 12 million active customers, increasing 12% over last year and making up 64% of second quarter sales. We've addressed the execution related to Nordstrom notes and redemptions are in line with expectations. Enrollments are up over last year and importantly we saw a significant improvement in customer satisfaction scores during the quarter. With respect to digital marketing, we increased our level of investment in Full-Price and have further plans to accelerate Off-Price.","For example in the first half, we had a 25% year-over-year reduction of flash event and plan to get back to prior levels with high quality events. And third in merchandising, you need initial investments in women's apparel to address the gap in our assortment from a price points perspective. We are encouraged by the sell-through performance and we're accelerating plans for the second half. In addition, we're applying our anniversary learnings to increase depth to key items specifically for the holidays or amplifying our gift assortment across categories and increasing the mix at more accessible price points.","For the second quarter, our gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points from last year due to occupancy deleverage. Q2 merchandise margin rate relative to last year improved sequentially from Q1 and markdown levels were consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position reflecting two consecutive quarters of positive spread sales. Expense performance well exceeded our expectations. Our SG&A rate in Q2 increased modestly by 26 basis points, reflecting fixed costs deleverage on lower sales volume.","SG&A expense was down 4% compared to the previous year. This was primarily due to our expense savings in addition to performance related adjustment. Today, we have delivered expense savings of $100 million tracking ahead of our annual plans of $150 million to $200 million. Our efficiency initiatives include realignment of our support structure and stores, end-to-end process improvement in supply chain and technology and lower discretionary spend. These initiatives represent permanent reductions to our cost structure that position as well for strong EBIT flows through. During the second quarter we also managed variable expense as well in a tough sales environment and maintained flat overhead expenses. ","Expenses related to digital capabilities, marketing, technology and supply chain were relatively flat to last year. Our Q2 EBIT margin of 5.7% deleverage by 47 basis points over last year. A meaningful improvement from Q1. EBIT for our generational investments met our expectations.","Moving to the full year, we lowered the top end of our prior outlook for revised EPS range of $3.25 to $3.50. We expect a sales decline of approximately 2% for the year versus the prior outlook range between a 2% decrease to flat growth. The impact of tariffs has not been incorporated into our outlook, but we believe it will be relatively immaterial for the year.","Now I'd like to provide color on our assumptions for the second half. Sales are expected to be flat at the midpoint reflecting roughly a 400 basis point improvement from the first half. This incorporates four sales drivers all which are weighted equally. First, our merchandise plans include rebalancing our assortment, increasing depth of key items and accelerating opportunistic buys for off-price. ","Second, we are accelerating our marketing efforts including our Nordstrom Rack Television brand campaign in additional flash events in off-price, while continuing digital marketing investments in full-price. Third, we will lap last year's Nordy Club launch with respect to Nordstrom notes with most of the impact in the fourth quarter. And fourth, sales in the New York flagship, opening on October 24th will primarily benefit the fourth quarter. For the third quarter, we expect sales to improve modestly from the first half. We expect gross profit rate expansion from improved sell-through at the anniversary product.","We also expect our SG&A rate to be leveraged from fixed cost, which includes pre open expenses for New York flagship. Third quarter EBIT margin is expected to be relatively flat including last year's estimated credit related charge. For the fourth quarter, we expect the New York City flagship opening to tribute sales in the fourth quarter, as well as occupancy deleverage. Taking a step back, our framework to drive shareholder value remains consistent. Gain market share, improve profitability and returns and maintain a discipline capital allocation approach.","We're focused on driving the top-line, leveraging inventory and bending the expense curve. Over time, we expect our generational investments to further scale and contribute to improve profitability and return on invested capital. We have a strong balance sheet and maintain a consistent approach to capital allocations. As we exit this year's heavy investment cycle, we expect moderating CapEx and accelerating free cash flow beyond 2019. CapEx levels are expected to moderate from 6% this year to 3% to 4% of sales and appropriate level to fund our strategic objectives.","In terms of the long -term financial targets we shared a year ago, we will focus on delivering on our current year expectations and intend to revisit those targets after we finish the year. In closing, our priorities are to drive our top-line, improve profitability and execute key strategies to enhance the customer experience. ","I'll now turn over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we would appreciate if you can limit to one question to allow everyone a chance to ask a question. Also as a reminder, the company does not plan to comment on market rumors or speculation. We will now move to the Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","EdwardYruma","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the insight on anniversary. I know you indicated that your strategy of kind of deeper in brands that the customer loves seem to have worked. But just try to help us understand a little bit some of the conversion issues you experienced. And you obviously indicated that the pre-sale did well or at least the customers responded to it. So I guess just kind of what did the consumer not like about anniversary that contributed to the soft top line. Thank you.","ErikNordstrom","Ed, this is Erik. We did go into the event go narrow and deeper on brands. We headed it out some of the long tail of our brand and went deeper in our customer's favorite brands. That being said we didn't go far enough. We simply ran out of our top items. And also we have a long history with anniversary sale. There was a change this year in customer behavior. Certainly, we always see a highly disproportionate amount of demand on our top items. What was different this year was how deep that disproportion amount was. We saw more demand on our top items than we seen previously.","And we simply ran out faster of our top items than we had planned. So we're encouraged that I think our buyers did a great job of picking the right items and putting the dollars in the best items. We just should have could have done a better job of going deeper on those top items. And that would apply you brought up the early access portion as we mentioned we had a lot of good customer feedback on the changes we've made this year. But again I think what we could have done better. We could have had deeper positions on our top item.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. Please proceed.","OmarSaad","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up and a lot of the detail and commentary you made on the Los Angeles market local. Maybe you can elaborate what it is about this experience where you're seeing your loyal customer who gets free shipping and returns. Going to the store, order online, pick it up in the store and how do we make sense of that in an e-commerce shipping world? And then what is it --what are the inventory implications on the other side at least within the Los Angeles market and maybe at least theoretically thinking about it longer term as you expand these kind of strategies to other markets. Thank.","ErikNordstrom","Thanks Omar. Yes, there's clearly being able to have a broad --the broad selection that customers are coming, customers to online but being able to pick it up in stores resonates with lots and lots of customers. Just looking at a lot of retailers results this last couple weeks, seems to me there's a pretty common thread there of some successes in various categories of company doing this. We've had BOPUS capabilities for quite some time. We did make some changes and mostly impactfully in Los Angeles, we greatly increased to the selection that customers have in doing a buy-online-pickup-in store for next day. Specifically, we're able to leverage the entire markets inventory that we're having stores.","And what the customer choose where they want to pick it up. We're able to move around that inventory very efficiently between our stores in the market, get it there quickly and customers love it. Our customer satisfaction scores on that service are amongst the highest. We have of anything we do and mention the inventory implications of that part of our local market strategy is getting to a different level of inventory efficiency in particular having the capabilities of holding back inventory, and allocating it as needed to its stores or be it to customers home. ","We haven't done that yet. We're still working on that. We've done some testing. We're getting in position to do that. But we certainly think that that's the next step of Nordstrom local is getting even bigger selection to customers having fewer out of stocks. And for us reaching another level of inventory efficiency.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","OliverChen","Hi. Thank you. Regarding the product opportunity ahead and thinking about rebalancing in key items and the investments you need to make. Is it very different on the full-price side versus rack? And how as you do approach holiday, the key topic is value as well as e-commerce and sustainability? Would love your thoughts.","PeteNordstrom","Yes. This is Pete. I think for us just being more thoughtful and purposeful about how price impacts really our offering. And this is particularly clear when holiday, when we've been able to get some objective information about how customers purchased gifts, the prices that they're really looking for from us. And we just --we are going to be much more purposeful at having the proper amount of inventory, first of all, in the gift classifications that make sense but also with prices that working for us, no really looking more to $50 to $150 or $200 cut price points. And so we have a pretty broad range of prices that we have to offer.","And it doesn't serve as well just have kind of democratic approach across every category that we're in. We need to step back and figure out where to invest the money to be a better gift destination for customers. And I can just tell you in our experience of being around this it feels like the most purposeful attempt for us to improve into be a gift destination. So we think we've learned a lot and as Erik mentioned, anniversary I think was helpful kind of understanding depth of stuff.","So we feel good about our chance to have a good holiday's result of that. As you talked about price and what happens in off-price and full-price, it's a version of it that's applicable in both places and we are trying to be thoughtful and surgical about how we're doing it. So I just think it puts extra focus on our ability to be good editors and curators, something we've been able to approach with some more objective information. We have better days than we've ever had before. So again I think from our point of view it feels like the less opinion based thing and if it's much more purposeful around objective information.","OliverChen","Okay, great. And would love your thoughts on re-commerce Nordstrom's been really ahead of the curve with what customers want. And I know you have an innovative partnership with Rent The Runway.","PeteNordstrom","Yes. Well, thematically it's abundantly clear that the whole sustainability subject is really important to lots of customers and so it's important to us. And I think the re-commerce thing plays right into that. And there's a bunch of things that we're working on that we're really not in position to fill you in on right now because a lot of things are flying. But I think it's fair to assume that at the major theme for our merchandising strategy that is right at the heart of the lot of it and it gives us a great opportunity to work collaboratively with our brand partners to figure out how to satisfy customers better on that score.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Proceed great.","JaySole","Great. Thanks so much. Erik, I appreciate your comments on the anniversary sale. If you take a step back and maybe just help us understand sales for the company are down 4.3% the first half. If you could pick out maybe two or three real big picture things that explain why the sales have -- the sales growth rate has slowed down so much from where it was historically going back five or ten years it'd be really helpful. Thank you.","ErikNordstrom","Sure. Well, first I'd starts with what we talked about in first quarter. We identified three areas. Loyalty program, digital marketing and the balance of our merchandise assortment. We made good progress on the first two. The loyalty program and digital marketing, we saw a general good traffic across our properties. As we talked about in the first quarter, the merchandise assortment takes longer. We have also had buys in place and around that we have opportunities and the balance of our price points and we have opportunities in being in stock in these top items that we've been talking about.","We've seen some encouraging signs there. Those that rebalancing is underway but we expected that to have more attraction in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we did in the second quarter.","JaySole","Do you feel like that the company organizationally is the right structure? And what do you feel like is the key to sort of driving traffic back into the stores? And driving that store sales growth right back to a higher level.","ErikNordstrom","Well, as you know, we've been working our local market strategy for a couple years now. And that is progressing and we started last year in LA really to do a lot of testing with customers, lot of listening of how we can connect our digital and physical assets to better serve customers. This year it's really been about scaling it in LA. We started with our four stores in LA. We've now expanded in particular that buy-online pick-up in store greater selection for next day delivery across 16 stores in Los Angeles, Orange County as well as our three local stores.","And we're seeing really tremendous traction on that service in particular. But stepping back, it is --it's looking at our physical assets as points of engagement as much as they are points of sale. We really don't care where the sale gets rung up. And we continue to learn that there are physical assets that that's when leverage really how customers want make a tremendous difference. So we talked about buy online pickup in store. We know customers who use that service then double those that don't use it. I think others talked about alterations before operation is obviously something that can't be done digitally. And it's something we're really good at.","We're the largest employer of tailors in North America. I think we have the best tailors they are out there. And the customers are engaged all our alterations area. There's been triples when a customer engages with a stylist, their spend goes up 5x. So that engagement is really what we're looking for be with services, be it across channels, we know the more engagement we get with customers the better it is. And through our local market strategy in particular, we feel really good that we've found some ways to leverage these physical assets that really resonate with customers. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","AlexandraWalvis","Good evening. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question clarifying the guidance. You helpfully break down what the four drivers of the four point improvement in comps into the back half likely to be. I was wondering if you could clarify whether the sales from the New York flagship would all be coming in the fourth quarter given the opening date. And then a follow-up question now I think that implies some pretty strong sales per square foot in that new store. And can you talk about the level of confidence there and your perhaps expectations on the P&L implications of that specifically. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Hi, Alexandra. I'm going to start with the clarification on the guidance piece to it. So as you mentioned the store does open on October 24th. So there will be very I mean tiny amount in Q3 and I would say the significant majority of what you would see would be in Q4 which is how we framed the guidance on this. And as far as again how we're looking at New York and I think Erik and Pete can weigh in on this but provides more color on this, but we've really seen this is -- we're opening this for positionally entering a market. And I think when Erik went through his slides and we had the slide talking about the seven points in Manhattan that we are servicing customers. We're really approaching this as not only opening the tower but our locals leveraging other touch points between Trunk Club and Racks as well as an enhancements in our online with our customers as well.","ErikNordstrom","Yes. I would just add on to that. So we think it's really important that with opening of the tower that we have these other assets and services coming online around the same time. So I know we've announced that will be opening two Nordstrom local service hubs; one of the Upper East Side, one in the village. And we're also able to execute and deliver the most popular services our customers haven't-- we've seen in Los Angeles our local which is do returns, online returns in particular. Order pickup and alterations at our two rack locations in Manhattan as well as the Trunk Club clubhouse. So we left seven locations on Manhattan to be able to take care of customers.","And there's really a synergy between those assets. The inventory we have there. The people we have there. Services were able to provide. And we had a lot of proof points in Los Angeles. We're set up well to leverage that from New York, but I would reiterate enhance point and we had that one slide in my section that shows the map and the seven locations really emphasize that that's where that if we are opening a market we have assets, physical and services that we are excited to bring to New York City customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","PaulTrussell","Good afternoon. On margins, on SG&A dollars were nicely managed. Could you highlight some of the areas of savings? And do you now expect to deliver above the original $150 million to $200 million of savings you originally outlined? And also on gross margins can you just talk about the puts and takes please? Both in regards to what you experienced in the second quarter but also your level of confidence in terms of expecting expansion in the third quarter. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Hi, Paul. So let me take the SG&A piece as well, as we've talked about we had three particular drivers driving our SG&A, one is realigning our support structure and costs for the store, the second one is really driving end-to-end productivity initiatives to supply chain and technology. And I would say to a lesser degree, it's more discretionary spending across the board. And I would say that's a small piece of all the things that we've been doing. So those are the three levers, we've been pulling and working through. And as you mentioned, we are ahead of our plan. So when you look at our overall guidance for the year, we basically -- typically we had in Q2, attempt our plan for the second half and bend the beat we had. So we are exceeding what we originally had thought in Q1. So that's how you get to the reconciliation of the guidance.","On gross margin, as we mentioned, our merch margins were actually in line with our expectations as far as markdowns. The only thing we had was the leverage on our occupancy expenses within our sales volume. As we go through the rest of the year, we really didn't change any of our guidance assumptions on margin. As Erik have talked about how we thought about Anniversary sale as far as having better margins in the third quarter from the Anniversary product. That was the plan that we made and we're continuing to progress on that. So again one thing that's changed on overall guidance was basically the top line.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed.","MarkAltschwager","Thanks and good afternoon. Nice job on the expense savings. I was hoping you could dig a bit more into how the operating model is really changing at the store level and just really what you're doing differently. I think that's a big component of the cost savings that you've outlined. And I also think this is the first Anniversary sale period, since you've put some of these operational changes into place. So just curious how that all played out during the higher-volume period and any key learnings as you move forward to the holiday? Thanks.","ErikNordstrom","Thanks Mark. Yes, the implications on operating model, especially on our store are pretty profound. Our stores -- we're going to leverage the inventory we have in our stores to better serve customers, meaning the stores are increasingly becoming fulfillment centers as well as selling directly to customers. So we have had changes in our models in our store there to do that. We need more people handling both online orders are being filled as well as returns coming back, and getting that inventory resalable as quickly as possible. That's gone really well, and in particular, over Anniversary was such an intense period of demand. We saw significant improvement in our fulfillment rates in our stores as well as the speed of delivery direct to customers in our key markets. So we feel really good about that.","MarkAltschwager","Thanks. And if I could just quickly follow up on a previous question. The implied sales guidance is quite a bit stronger for Q4 versus Q3. Is there anything beyond the Manhattan store coming online that's driving that difference? If you could just talk about some of the drivers there, that would be helpful.","Anne Bramman","Yes. What we try to do is give you full-year and then give you the Q3 assumptions. And we talked about how we expect sales to moderate -- moderately getting better in Q3 and then some of the big drivers. -- the biggest outstanding driver was Q4. So I would assume is that out of the four levers that we laid out, you are going to continue to see some improvement, particularly as we go through the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.","DanaTelsey","Good afternoon. Two quick things. As you think of the women's apparel market and what you've been seeing there, did anything from the Anniversary sale informed you for what should be in the store or other brands or what's happening with some of the existing innovative brands that you have to expand or to contract and bring in others? And lastly, what does success mean to you for the New York store? Are there any metrics around it that you can place? Thank you.","PeteNordstrom","Hi Dana, it's Pete. We made some strides in women's apparel. That's not a lot that you can easily quantify at this point, but I think certainly creating a road map for the future for us to bend the curve there. As Erik mentioned, I think we did a good job of identifying the key items and brands and styles that customers are responding to. So we've always had a pretty aggressive program on trying to identify and amplify emerging brands. I guess what I can tell you is changes -- the cycle on all that stuff is shorter than it's ever been. So one of the things we need to do is identify new emerging brands and amplify them quickly. It isn't a matter of test and learns over a couple of years, a couple of stores in time. So I guess what I could say just more broadly is that I think we have more confidence in our ability that will put on the gaps, when things are working well.","And the same holds true for perhaps some legacy brands that are declining. And we have some very big built up established businesses with some legacy brands, where it's going the wrong way. So our teams have to be really good editors. They've got to be curious and they can't really use last year, so much as a guide. So the other thing, I would say is thematically really understanding the way price impacts classifications and just getting sharper about that is helpful. So it's been kind of a tough go for a while in women's apparel, but I think it's fair to say that we have optimism about our ability to make some improvements there, particularly starting at the back half of the year. And then, the other question was about, I'm sorry, was it about New York specifically Dana?","DanaTelsey","Yes. How do you quantify success of the New York store, what would you be looking at in a year or how do you think of the New York store? What would make it in your mind as success? Did the volumes match Seattle or how do you think about it?","PeteNordstrom","Yes. There's obviously a way of quantifying and we don't break out those numbers by the store. But I think what Anne mentioned really is the way that we look at by market. And I think as we mentioned all the way along, already is our largest online market. And we know when we have physical access to a market like that we grow our online business considerably as well, adding the stores and that sale in the physical stores as well. So we'll probably have more to say about as that begins. But I think ultimately the way you guys should be keeping scoring it; it's looking for us to look at it in terms of a market.","I would say, though, if you're asking us, particularly in the near term, how we're going to view the success. I think it's really along the lines of can we deliver a great customer experience there and all the ways that I think customers would expect from Nordstrom entering the market. There are plenty of places to buy things in New York and if we're really successful that is because we do the little thing that is actually big thing. Just the way that we serve customers in a more relevant, a more convenient way, we've heard that theme a lot. And we've got a good team of leaders that were ready to take that challenge on. So, no, I think we'll be getting a lot of indications about our ultimate ability to be successful there based on the reaction that we get from customers that our ability to step up and did deliver something that's --.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","MatthewBoss","Great. Thanks. So at Off-Price, this was the weakest quarter on the top line, I think in five plus years. I guess what's driving the magnitude of the slowdown? What's the timeline to stabilize the concept? And any change in your view regarding the long-term size of the brick-and-mortar fleet for Rack?","ErikNordstrom","Yes. I would merely point to those issues we've had across our Full-Price business, in fact our Off-Price business as well, the loyalty, digital marketing and merchandise assortment. The loyalty is as you mentioned, we had good progress over the quarter. So we like the directions that were there. The digital marketing, we're a little further behind in Off-Price than we are in Full-Price. We do have still some traffic opportunities in Off-Price. We feel much better about that. In particular, what's unique about Off-Price, which we touched on our comments, is flash. We did a deep dive at the end of last year into all* our flash events. We had a number of flash events that were one category that we don't carry in our stores and with the majority of our online returns coming back to our stores that creates issues.","But number two, they were unprofitable events. So we did a lot of editing at these flash events. The flip side is what's really a plus about the flash model is the traffic generation engagement mainly through email that we give our customers, who sign up these flash events is terrific and helps us not only on the flash site, but helps us on our Rack.com site as well. So we felt the reduction in traffic from cutting back on those events. We started the last -- about last three weeks back on more of our normal cadence there of flash events and the key to there is not just quantity of flash events, it's the quality of flash events. And we feel really good about that.","So feel good about flash events going forward that it's going to be differentiated than the first half. We feel good about the marketing that's going to be differentiated than the first half. The other point [Indecipherable] noticed here is the inventory position. I mean we're sitting here midway through the year with lots of open to buy across our Company, but particularly in Off-Price. In Off-Price, the biggest driver Off-Price business is having great merchandise. Being opportunistic, especially in times like now that are tough for the industry, we're really excited about the position we're into to really pick up some compelling merchandise for our customers and get them into our Rack brand.","MatthewBoss","And quick-follow up. Any reason for the lack of share buyback this quarter and how best to think about capital allocation in the back half?","Anne Bramman","Yes, Matt. So we've always been really consistent about how we approach capital allocation and it's the first and foremost, we look at investing in the business. And we talked about this as a very heavy investment cycle year for us as we complete the payments and the investments we're making in New York. And as we exit out of the year, that CapEx investments are -- be coming are more moderated environment than we have seen in the past throughput [with that]","And then the second piece to it is, of course, our dividend and also staying, we are very focused on investment grade. So the way we look to share buyback in the past is we need excess cash for that. And so that's kind of the priority of how we look at our capital allocations.","TrinaSchurman","Okay. We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Hackett. Please proceed.","ChuckGrom","Thanks. Just a few housekeeping things. I guess first on the third quarter guide, can you quantify how much gross margin expansion you're anticipating? Second would be on the second quarter, could you perhaps walk us through categories that either outperformed or underperformed? And then third, on the note redemption issue, is there a way you can speak to how much it's improved and maybe quantify how much of the drag it was in the fourth quarter of last year, given that you're going to be cycling that. And I think that's part of your equation for acceleration in sales later this year. Thanks.","Anne Bramman","Pete, do you want to take the assortment question.","PeteNordstrom","Yes, sure. In the second quarter, we had pretty significant improvement in the beauty area. I think we mentioned that before that we had some out of stock issues at the beginning of the year hurt us. And so we bent the curve there and beauty improved quite a bit. To me, it's been a consistent story for quite some time as our designer business across all categories positive. That continues to be a good growth opportunity for us. Our MPG area did very well, our own product that showed some improvement. That's good to see.","And then lastly, I'd say that the lingerie and activewear in women's performed relatively better. The tougher areas for us are we had some slowdown in shoes. I think that represented a moment in time we shall see, but that was a bit of a dip from where it was that the shoes have been performing strongly.","Men's had some challenges. I would say the biggest driver there that we've noticed, and this is not a surprise to anyone who follows our industry but the continued kind of casualization of American that impacts the men's business quite a bit. And so while we're still serving a lot of men and selling them things, the average price of what we're selling them oftentimes is less than it was when they were buying more suits and ties and things of that nature. So there are adjustments we need to continue to make, but I think that those kind of represent the stronger performing categories relative to the future performance from last quarter.","Anne Bramman","And as far as your question on margin, the guidance we gave is that we thought gross profit at the end of the year would have slight de-leverage really driven on -- de-leverage on occupancy, based on our sales volume. And so when we talked about Q3, what we said was that we thought -- we thought merch margin would actually be an improvement year-over-year because of the Anniversary sell-through that we're expecting from how we plan Anniversary.","I mean and just to remind you, Q4 will actually have the occupancies in New York City baked into it. I think from that you can kind of bake into your model. As far as the Nordstrom note, we gave that split roughly evenly for the second half. You can probably imagine if you are anniversarying this note redemptions and the time it takes for people to accumulate and redeem, the cumulative effect. So it's not going to be completely even across the two quarters. But for the second half it's roughly 500 basis points.","End of Q&A","Trina Schurman","Again, thank you for joining today's call. A replay along with a slide presentation and prepared remarks will be available for one year on our website. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.","Operator","Thank you.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","And I would now like to introduce Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes including about 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statement so please to the slide showing our Safe Harbor Language.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President; and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's third quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2014.","Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Direct.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake Nordstrom","Thank you for joining us for our earnings call. For the past several quarters we've communicated that we are focused on a customer strategy, which we think is critical to our business in delivering a superior customer experience. This strategy provides clarity as we address allocation of our resources, both capital and people, to serve our customer in the manner they expect from us. This focus has positioned us to engage with the customer across multiple channels in full-price, off-price, stores, and online. Most importantly, we know the customer views as simply as Nordstrom.","Customers increasingly value speed, convenience, and personalization. We're focused to create synergies across our business through service and experience, product, customer acquisition and retention, and companywide customer capabilities.","We had a number of new store openings this quarter, including three full-line stores inclusive of a second store in Houston, Texas, and our first store in Jacksonville, Florida. We also entered Canada in Calgary on September 19. We would like to call out the terrific job that our team led by Karen McKibbin, President of our Canada Division, has done leading up to our opening.","For the past couple of years, they have been working behind the scenes to address the unique challenges of crossing the border with supply chain, inventory, loyalty, talent, systems, and other material aspects of the business. The warm reception we've received from the customers in Calgary is encouraging. We're also pleased with the stores performance which has significantly exceeded expectations.","We believe we're going in the right direction and in a good position to open our second store on March 6, 2015, in Ottawa. In total, as you know we're committed to six stores in Canada, with Vancouver following Ottawa, and then three in Toronto. Also during the quarter the Rack opened 16 stores for a total of 27 for the year.","Next as we discussed in the August call, we're excited about the acquisition of Trunk Club, which closed in late August. Trunk Club offers a differentiated way in serving customers on their terms to an experience that is personalized, relevant, and convenient. This partnership clearly aligns with our strategic priorities to increase relevance with customers and strengthen our capabilities. The business is on track with its growth plans which include a fifth showroom that will open on December 1, in Manhattan; it will be in a terrific location on 51st and Madison. With New York representing Trunk Club's largest market, it is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement with existing customers and serve new customers.","Our combined teams have also been developing plans to leverage our capabilities around product, services, and supply chain.","Now we'd like to provide some additional color on our current execution. We generated a top-line increase of 8.9% during the quarter. Our comparable sales increase of 3.9% was generally consistent with the trends we've experienced over the last year or two.","In terms of our inventory, we've been making investments to support store and online growth throughout the year. That said we ended the quarter with approximately 2% of our inventory that was unplanned which was attributable to the Rack. Though there are numerous factors that contributed to this, the simple fact is we bought more than we should have. We're still committed to meeting our year-end plans and we're confident we can manage this appropriately. Mike will be providing additional context on this in his remarks.","Now we'd like to talk to you about our clearance strategy. As you know we've historically held clearance events notably our half yearly sales. As we listen to our customers we acknowledge there is an opportunity to improve. We have begun to make adjustments to our clearance strategy, and we expect that overtime these changes will result in a better customer experience, a reduction of clearance days, and an improvement to our inventory turn. We will comment on our progress as we move forward.","As we head into the fourth quarter, our plans are consistent with what we've been focused on for the year. We think we're in a good position this holiday season and we're pleased with our team's efforts not only for the fourth quarter but to position the company for 2015 and going forward.","I'd now like to turn it over to Mike.","Mike Koppel","Thanks, Blake. This quarter's performance reflects the ongoing commitment to our customer strategy. Both the current operating performance and ongoing strategic investments support our goal of delivering a superior customer experience. Over the past several years our investments to enhance the customer experience have fueled growth in stores and online. And now our entry into Canada represents a new channel of growth.","When we made the strategic decision we knew it requires significant effort and learnings to establish the infrastructure and processes to support operating in a new market. So we are particularly proud of the team's accomplishment and a disciplined approach they've taken along the way.","Now we'd like to provide some additional color on our current performance. Earnings per diluted share of $0.73 were in line with our expectations, reflecting sales trends that have been generally consistent throughout the year. Our quarterly results included a $0.04 dilutive impact related to the acquisition of Trunk Club.","The multiple elements of our growth strategy contributed to our top-line increases of 8.9% which aligns with our long-term goal of high-single-digit sales growth. Comparable sales increased 3.9% driven by our full price business, which reflected continued momentum in online sales and a slight improvement in full-line stores.","Moving to the Rack, total sales grew 15% reflecting 27 store openings during the year. Comparable sales increased 1.7% down from its year-to-date increase of 4%. In the online off-price business sales at Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook grew 34%. This was meaningfully ahead of the 13% growth in the first half of the year, reflecting the building momentum in this channel and inventory investments to expand selection.","Now we'd like to provide additional color on our gross profit and inventory performance. Gross profit was 33 basis points lower than last year, which reflected Rack's accelerated store expansion and some impact from price matching in our full price business. Price integrity is very important to us, as we strive to earn and maintain our customer's trust. This has been a longstanding policy of ours and we will continue to monitor and respond accordingly.","On a square footage basis, ending inventory growth of 18% outpaced sales growth of 5%. Roughly 75% of the inventory growth was planned largely driven by store and online growth. Remainder of the growth was due to Rack inventory being over planned. We are very focused on long-term ROIC performance and understand inventory productivity as a significant driver. We feel confident in our ability to make meaningful progress, improving our inventory position by the end of the year, with potential impact incorporated in our expectations.","Moving to SG&A, we continue to focus on our expense execution. Our SG&A rate including Trunk Club, Canada, and our ongoing technology investments was relatively flat to last year. As we previously shared with you we have estimated a full year EBIT impact of Canada which consists of infrastructure and preopening expenses to be roughly $35 million. We are on track with two-thirds incurred to-date.","Now we'd like to provide an update of our full year outlook. Our earnings per diluted share outlook is $3.70 to $3.75, compared with the prior outlook of $3.80 to $3.90. This now includes the additional impact to Trunk Club, which is expected to be diluted by approximately 3% compared to our initial estimate of 3% to 5%.","Comparable sales are expected to increase roughly 3.5% compared with an increase of 3% to 4% from the prior outlook, which is generally consistent with our year-to-date trend.","Our SG&A rate outlook is expected to be increase 40 to 45 basis points over last year, compared to our prior outlook of 10 to 20 basis points due to the impact of Trunk Club.","Before we wrap up, I'll note that the process regarding potential sale of our credit card receivables is going as planned and is expected to be completed around the first half of 2015.","In closing, we are on track with executing our customer strategy, which we believe will drive long-term profitable growth and deliver top quartile total shareholder return.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started, we like to request that you ask one question and if necessary one follow-up. If you have additional questions please return to the queue. We will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss - J.P. Morgan","Hey. Good afternoon guys. So brick and mortar full-line comps were flat, best in over a year. Can you talk about the drivers of some of the improvements and the sustainability of flatter or the potential for positive brick and mortar base going forward?","Jamie Nordstrom","Sure Matthew. This is Jamie. I think this has been for continuation of a lot of initiatives that have been underway for some time to improve our full-line business. As we keep saying, we don't -- we don't have a channel strategy, we have a customer strategy. So there's lot of things that we've been doing with technology and with e-commerce to elevate how we serve customers in total.","But that being said, there is lot of things that have been happening in our stores around space allocation, staffing, our stylist program which we've been talking about for some time now has been great. Doing things like pop and shops, creating more reasons for customers to want come to our stores, but ultimately flow of new great products is typically what drives our business. And that's nothing new, but when we're good at that, when we have a good flow of new stuff that people want to see, our business gets better and I think this quarter is a good example of that.","Matthew Boss - J.P. Morgan","Great. And just a quick follow-up question on the brick and mortar. As we think about some of the strategic changes that you've made as it relates to promotions, what's the best way to think about the underlying merchandize margins going forward?","Jamie Nordstrom","We really haven't made any changes with regards to promotion. I think you might be referring to our transition away from the half yearly model, with our clearance strategy. Our -- as you're probably aware, our half yearly clearance strategy goes back decades and back to when we were a shoe business. We felt that that model really kind of handicapped our ability to improve our flow of fresh new regular price goods. We saw some opportunities to improve that because we know that's what our customers want. And that's what drives our business.","So we think by evolving how we clear merchandise, we can improve our flow of regular priced goods. And so we've started that transition. And so far we're encouraged with our progress.","But I want to be clear; it's not about adding more promotions. In fact, what you'll see is over the next year we'll actually have less days with clearance on our floors than we did with the old model.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Wondered if you could update us on the progress that you've been making in terms of your assortments, particularly on the, I guess the women's side of the business. Where are you in terms of the top shops you've put into place? How are things like the brass Plum doing? You brought in new brands like Sarah Jessica Parker shoes. Just wondering how the overall performance of women's has done relative to expectations.","Pete Nordstrom","This is Pete. We have such a broad offering in women's that goes from juniors all the way through designers. That at any given time you can point to some things that are working well and some things that are not as well. I think our story now is really has been fairly consistent and a continuation of where we've been. We've seen improvement in our juniors business and brass Plum. It's definitely kind of bottomed out. I think we've had a couple of tough years there and that has improved.","I think part of that is what we've been able to do with Topshop and how that's bringing more customers into our stores and online, some new customers. That's been very positive. The Topshop, Topman business has been very good for that. For us we're in 53 doors now we're going to expand that more as much as it's practically possible as soon as it's possible. So it's been a lot of work on the Topshop parts to make that happen but they've been really good partners and we're very encouraged about where that's going.","I guess what I would add is we continued to do well when we can maximize the power of brands that are important to our customers and we continue to invest in those not only in the way that we merchandise and display them on the floor but just literally our ownership there and we've had success in women's on that angle.","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Great. Thanks. And good luck.","Blake Nordstrom","Thank you.","Mike Koppel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Just moving to the Rack, if you can just give us a little bit of detail on the deceleration in the quarter. Was it traffic related? Where other competitors in the marketplace, aggressive on promotions? What did you see in the store? And then what has been the reception been to nordstromrack.com over these last few months?","Blake Nordstrom","Paul, this is Blake. We did see a deceleration from the trends we've had almost four years, towards the end of the quarter predominantly in October. We don't have strong data from a customer count point of view. We do from a transaction point of view but our business was softer and there is I guess a number of factors that contributed to it but it was a blip and we're hoping that the fourth quarter is not a reflection of that because certainly that's a very narrow window and so we're not trying to over overreact to that but we wanted to share that with you. We didn't see anything different from a competitor promotional point of view. It just was softer in our stores and it was reflective in our top-line for the month of October.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","And then, just to follow-up, maybe we can just quickly touch based on Trunk Club. Could you just give us a little bit of color around the overall impact now as we think about modeling that out for 4Q and beyond in terms of revenue and SG&A share count impact?","Mike Koppel","Well, Paul, this is Mike. In terms of the impact it's going to have to our EPS for the year, we've said it's roughly 3% dilutive. And we did call out that it's roughly $0.04 in the third quarter so you can do the math and understand the impact in the fourth quarter. As far as breaking it out by line item we're not providing that kind of specific guidance right now.","That being said, we continue to be excited about the momentum in the business. The business has achieved so far our expectations in terms of a rolling 12-month growth and we're looking forward to see how it performs during the holiday season.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","","Hi, guys, thanks for the details. And regarding the inventory and your comments about having a bit more than you wanted at Rack, what's the nature of that inventory? Like what kind of products was it and where is your conviction lie in terms of your confidence that you can work through it? Like how might that be done? Thank you.","Blake Nordstrom","Oliver, this is Blake. We've done both in the Rack and throughout the Company; our merchandising teams for a number of years have had terrific disciplines on inventory management. And it's even more important in the Rack where you want to be really fluid and be able to react and respond to goods that are available. I would just tell you and I tried to in my remarks, take accountability and not point to any one thing because there's a number of factors but it really starts and stops with having grounded plans and our teams executing accordingly to them and our merchants particularly our general merchandise managers have done a terrific job of opening the doors in the partnerships we have with our best vendors and it's simply a case of our buying teams in the Rack buying too much for the size of the business. And so in months or quarters past, there might be fallout, there might be increased sales that kind of masked that. And we think the end of the quarter there; there were a number of things that contributed to it.","So that said, if you're in a more fashion type business and you get overbought, you can almost the methodology or the math shows right to what it does to the margin or markdowns. We feel pretty good about the quality and content and aging of this merchandise and then part of this is with our pack-and-hold that we've been running a little bit higher for some time compared to previous years. And these are goods that our top vendors are clearing at the end of season that we're holding for roughly six months and bringing back in the appropriate season and so we think this is really solid merchandise. Our team feels confident by the end of the quarter we can be back in line and again our numbers are in our plans that we just shared with you. And so we fully expect to meet our plans but we just felt it was really important to be as transparent as possible with all of you that these are above our plans. It's unacceptable and we're getting after it.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Thank you. And just a follow-up. The outlook seems pretty solid. What do you think about volatility in the marketplace and what you're seeing in kind of the health of our consumer as we embark in some macros that looked more encouraging but things are pretty promotional?","Blake Nordstrom","Well, Oliver, we're asked that each quarter. And we're only as astute or smart as our last transaction or our figures. And so I think what we're trying to share with you is that our business has been really consistent for almost two years now. So that's how we view the fourth quarter. That's how we're planning the year. That's how we're thinking about going to 2015. That this is the hand we're dealt and we need to plan and execute accordingly. There's been pockets where it gets a little more promotional.","And as Mike said, we feel very strongly about one of our core principles, about having integrity with our pricing and being competitive. So we will respond accordingly, but we don't foresee anything material changing than what we experienced last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar, Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the questions as always. Wanted to drill down a little bit more on inventory. Would you care to give us some guidance on whether you would get back to some of your former inventory days or inventory turns per year? It's been up a little bit the last few years.","Mike Koppel","Yes. Paul, this is Mike. That's a great question. As I said in my comments, we fully understand and are very focused on the impact that a productive inventory has on our overall our overall return. And over the last year or so we've been in a fairly accelerated cycle in terms of funding growth and in various channels. And so we expect for the foreseeable future to continue funding for that growth so there's going to be a little bit of a lead lag relationship between inventory investment and the sales as we move forward but our long-term goals continue to be to improve that metric and to drive overall returns in the Company.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Is the acquisition; is it faster turning inventory on average?","Mike Koppel","Are you talking about Trunk Club?","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Yes.","","Mike Koppel","Well, Trunk Club is a lifeline. There is a very small amount of inventory. There is also some custom there. So -- and even if it was materially different in the metric, it's not going to make an impact to our total inventory. We carry about $2.2 billion of inventory and Trunk Club at this point is relatively small to that.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Great. Best of luck for the holidays.","Mike Koppel","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital.","Ed Yruma - KeyBanc Capital","Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess first, on the price match I know it's been roughly a year since you've been more I guess outward about your \"we will not be undersold\". Do you think you're saying the economic or customer return from that investment in price? And I guess now that you're laughing that, should we expect the year-over-year impact to be more muted?","Jamie Nordstrom","Ed, this is Jamie. I don't know if it's something that we've done necessarily differently over the last year. We've always been competitive on price. Nothing has changed about I think our stand. So I think what's changed is, is that the world has gotten little smaller. And we used to compete on price with the stores across the street and now its entire world via the Internet. So the game has changed a little bit and our approach to it has not changed.","That being said, I think it's been -- there's a trend around the promotional activity out there in the marketplace, has been fairly consistent over the last year. It tends to rise and fall with how inventories across the marketplace or whether they're healthy or not. And as inventories rise and some of the competition out there needs to mark stuff down to their business that affects prices. It's -- and of course, we have to be competitive with that. This -- so far this year, it's been a little less than we experienced last year. We're not quite sure what's going to happen in Q4 but well we're ready for it.","Blake Nordstrom","And Jamie, this is Blake. I'll quickly -- just I would add that we can really see it in the e-commerce business. And so when for any reason we find ourselves behind and not competitive you can see it in the sales. And so overall some of that for the total company is hard to measure. But if you're not competitive you're just not in the game in the long run.","Ed Yruma - KeyBanc Capital","Great. And a follow-up, if I may. In terms of the excess inventory at Rack, is it more systemic of the learning curve, of the pack-and-hold strategy or is it just because the comps have come in a little bit lighter than you would have expected? Thank you.","Blake Nordstrom","Yes, there are so many factors. Both that you just said apply. We get goods from the full-line sources in term of transfer. We buy merchandize from our top vendors. We also have the pack-and-hold as you alluded to. We now in the last year are taking HauteLook returns, which has been a great customer service for our customer; it's been a great driver of foot traffic in the Rack's but its more inventory come in the rack. So there's just countless inputs that add to this. There is some system issues in terms of information and knowledge on it. But the bottom-line is we have it to manage it better. And we're not going to fully achieve our long-term goals if we have volatility in our inventory management.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Calgary store, some of the early learnings and takeaways you have from the business. And wondering if you've been able to get all of the local brands up in Canada that you desire? Thank you.","Jamie Nordstrom","Hey Jeff, this is Jamie. We really did our homework on Calgary. I think we started working on, opening a store about three years ago. We put together a team to really focus on, on learning that customer I think that paid off and it's a dynamic town with great customers and we're focused on serving them well.","As Blake mentioned we're significantly ahead of plan there, pretty encouraged by the results and the first impression we've made with that customer. But we're going in business there for a long time. So we've still got a lot to learn on how we can serve that customer well. But we've decided to open in Ottawa in March, and then later in 2015 in Vancouver. But it's about those cities and those towns of customers we've got to learn what they want, we got to learn whether it's the weight of the fabric in those different climates. It's not about necessarily about Canada it's about those towns.","So we've got a lot to learn but we're really, really encouraged by our results and as we open more stores in Canada, I think we're going to continue to find ways of serving those customers better.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Right. And your HauteLook returns increased in the second quarter, I'm wondering if you could just speak to that business and are you still seeing a fairly high return rate and if so any thoughts as to why?","Erik Nordstrom","Jeff, this is Erik. We have not seen an increase in HauteLook return in the last quarter and I'm sure what you're referring to there.","Blake Nordstrom","I think perhaps the comment that we're taking more returns in the Rack.","Erik Nordstrom","Okay.","Blake Nordstrom","But not overall returns, you loved it, it's more people are returning in the Rack.","Erik Nordstrom","Right, it's HauteLook specifically the returns we think it has more tangible example of what you've heard I talk about for a while now. Our four-box strategy of being in online offline and full-price and off-price businesses through just customer desire, customer doing what serve them best and they have chosen to take returns to our Rack stores. We haven't done lot of marketing on that. To the point where over 70% of our HauteLook returns are coming to our Rack stores.","It's a way we can serve the customer better and we can serve them better because where we have these multiple businesses that have a synergy that have common merchandise they're on the same platforms. So that's been very encouraging to us, the HauteLook business remains very healthy. The big news in our online off-price business, the last quarter particularly has been with rack.com, which our HauteLook team is supporting all of our rack team here in Seattle. That business is really picking up.","Our selection is more than double since we first launched the site and I think more than just the quantity of merchandise the quality of the merchandise again is being driven by this synergy of working with our vendors in the multiple business we have. I think that the quality of the merchandise really improved and the customers responding accordingly.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Exstein from Credit Suisse.","Michael Exstein - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon everyone. Just two quick follow-up questions, one is what is the impact of Packaway inventories, its relatively new way for you to operate and how does that impact then. And how are you thinking about Trunk Club going forward, how do you integrate it into Nordstrom and really lever it going forward?","Jamie Nordstrom","Well Michael, in terms of the Packaway as you know over the last roughly 18 or 24 months we've increased our investments there, because we found that if we were out there early and in the market for the best product that seasons were transitioning, we could be the first at the table and get to that stuff. And so that's made our entire offer more compelling in the Rack, our sell-throughs on Packaway are measurably higher than other products. So it's a very solid investment.","And we're -- I think the challenges right now as we built so much momentum in the business and momentum in procuring the product that we got to make sure that we're balanced in how we approach it. And in terms of Trunk Club, Pete?","Pete Nordstrom","Yes, with regards for Trunk Club our focus in the short-term is mostly supporting their existing growth strategy. They've been on a more of an doubling of their business every 12 months and we really like their growth strategy. We think we can help them and obviously we can help them and we can focus on the short-term supply chain is an obvious one. I think there is some customer service elements like alterations that we can help them.","There is some products areas that we can help them and have already made some progress with. So that's our focus right now. We do think their business model has additional growth aspects that we will want to explore. At this time most of our focus has been really trying to support very good standards.","Operator","Thank you. Our next is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you, good afternoon. Just continuing on that topic, I was wondering if there are any lessons learned from the HauteLook acquisition that you could apply to Trunk Club in the coming years.","Erik Nordstrom","Sure, it's Erik. The answer is yes, very much so. I think similarly with HauteLook, HauteLook had a very strong growth strategy and we didn't want to get distracted too much at the beginning on that. I think the lesson is well that was the right thing to do, we could have been more thoughtful in a multiyear plan of where things are going because there is big value as we start to integrate some elements of business, elements like the merchandising between HauteLook and Rack has been more integrated over the last year in particular.","So that's we're at now where Trunk Club is. Well, we're not looking to have a lot of formal integration in the next quarter with it. We are playing out a three-year plan of where we think that the business going and having the right pace and identifying the right areas to integrate is something that we have learned from our HauteLook experience.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great thanks so much. I wanted to ask, Mike, about the Trunk Club acquisition. Is the full impact to EPS being felt here in Q3 and Q4? Or will there be some lingering impact in 2015 that you would like us to keep in mind? And then, secondarily, on the gross margins, year-to-date there's a little bit of pressure in the gross margin. It seems to be coming from two areas -- the accelerated growth in Rack and also, as you mentioned in today's press release, the increase in competitive markdowns. Are those factors that you would expect to remain as we look out into 2015?","Mike Koppel","Sure, Kimberly. Starting with Trunk Club, as we stated the annual 2014 impact is roughly 3% dilutive and we've recognized roughly a third of that in the third quarter, the balance will be in the fourth quarter. In terms of 2015 we'll certainly provide that clarity in terms of as far as 2015 when we give our guidance in February. But I will refer you when we publish the 10-Q after this quarter there will be very detailed disclosure on the purchase accounting and the resulting impact and you should get that details in that as well going forward.","In term of the gross margin, as far as the Rack I think we've been pretty consistent for a numbers of years as we've accelerated growth that we've set the geography of the Rack P&L is different than the majority of the business and that we tend to have lower merchandise margins but we also tend to have lower SG&A cost.","And so at that business becomes a larger percentage of total it's just by very nature averaging down the gross margin. So yes, we should continue to see that at least over the next couple of years as we continue to open a lot of stores there.","And then, in terms of the competitive markdown, it was relatively small this quarter. We called it out, because it was an element, and it's a big subject that's being talked about. Whether or not, that's going to continue at what level, I don't think we have an exact answer for that. But we will certainly continue to monitor that and respond accordingly to assure our customers have that same relationship with us over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question and congratulations.","Blake Nordstrom","Thank you.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","I wondered I have two different questions. My first question in regards to HauteLook, I wondered if you could talk about your marketing campaign strategies, what your learnings are from your TV advertising. That's my first question.","Erik Nordstrom","Hi Jennifer, this is Erik.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","Hi, Erik.","Erik Nordstrom","HauteLook has done some TV and has been effective with it. I guess learnings from it is that it can be very targeted, if it's very targeted, it's very effective. So specific cable programs that have aligned with their customer base which is little younger as you know, than our overall customer and it's been effective so far.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","So that is something you're going to continue.","Erik Nordstrom","I think so.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","Okay. I wondered you haven't talked about Active as a category, I think a couple of quarters ago, I asked about men's and you were talking about that you were in the development process of doing something in private label in men's. So I wondered if you could just talk about Active, I know, it's a growth category in women's, where you are, and where you are with men's. Thank you.","Pete Nordstrom","Hi, Jennifer, this is Peter. Active has been a strong category. But I think where it really plays itself out that's it's not a siloed thing, it's very specific to just one brand or one kind of functional activity, it's really been much more incorporated into kind of a -- almost an extension of Sportswear. So you wouldn't necessarily just see the impact of Active in just the Active department, it actually kind of plays out across multiple fronts. But there is still a big opportunity for us to be more meaningful with the most important brands. And so we have had good expansion there. And as you've mentioned with our label program with Zella specifically in women's Active it's been really good. Really, really good. And we're figuring out how to be able to extend that into men's and we're early days on that but I think we're encouraged by what we think is powerful there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Hi. Good Afternoon. So you mentioned the Rack.com business a little bit earlier in terms of how the product dynamics have changed over time. But could you may be discuss the difference between the full-line online business and Rack.com in terms of consumer behavior? May be how it differs in terms of transaction size, traffic conversion and some of those metrics.","Erik Nordstrom","Joan, this is Erik. We're not sharing those specifics, I don't have them right them in front of me but when I say the rack.com we're still very much on a steep learning curve on that. It is -- it's a young, just like an industry, the online off-price, and as you know, we've launched rack.com our persisting offer earlier this year. So if there are some differences we're learning between the flash sale business in HauteLook and persistent business in rack.com. There is -- and I think our improved results for the last couple of months, reflects some adjustments along the way there.","I will say what is reaffirming is the synergies from those businesses, with the rest of our business and specifically on the vendor side, the story to vendors of how we can acknowledge our customers better by showing their product in these different channels. But how we can help their business? We have more and more examples of that and there is an absolute synergy when we feature brands on HauteLook with a flash event and as well it's featuring big brands on rack.com. The only synergy amongst those business we see lift in our other businesses to those brands as well. So that story is resonating more and more with the marketplace and we think there is even more game to be had there.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Great. And is there any target in mind in terms of how big that business could ultimately be?","Erik Nordstrom","Nothing that we --","Blake Nordstrom","Nothing that we have shared. But clearly, we see as a big opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Hey, thanks guys. I'm just wondering on the Rack business if you saw a pretty consistent weakness throughout the quarter, if there was a pretty significant slowdown either in September and\/or October? And from an inventory perspective, just wondering if there are any particular categories where you're a little bit heavy at the Rack position? Thanks.","Blake Nordstrom","Paul, this is Blake. I will try to articulate with the end of the quarter, so predominantly October so that's when we saw the sales soften, materially from the trend. In terms of inventory, it's pretty balanced by division. So we don't have an example where one merchandizing area is much more than the other. They all are in a position where they are little bit over and so they have all got to a job to do here.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Blake, can you quantify what Rack was running prior to October?","Blake Nordstrom","We don't break it out in the middle of the quarter. But for the trend prior to that Q2, I think we were up 4% from a comp store basis, and for the quarter, we are 1.7% so just a little over 200 basis point change.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Hey guys, congrats on a great quarter.","Blake Nordstrom","Thanks Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS ","At the risk of beating it to death on the Rack, you sound like you're pretty comfortable that it was a fairly short-term blip. Do you expect that business, as you think about the math you put behind the comp guidance you gave us for fourth quarter, do you expect that business to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter -- just to help us put bookends on your call out on that business here?","Blake Nordstrom","Well, Michael, this is Blake. We are not expecting it to accelerate to cure our eUphills. I mean, we're not hoping and praying that business will get better and then this inventory will go away magically. I mean there's some heavy lifting to do but we're pretty comfortable that we -- it is a blip and it's something that we can get after and do this again in this quarter, right. I guess, I would tell that we will talk about it next quarter and if it's still a problem, my brothers might kick me out of this part of it. But we all own it, and we're going to make it happen.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay. Thanks. Is it -- and then, Mike, I know you don't want to get in to guiding on Trunk Club for next year. But my concern is that you have a lot of analysts fairly disorganized with the impact in their fiscal 2015 earnings here. Can you just help us think directionally? Because I think last time we talked to you that business was growing over 100%. And that operating margins were about to go from slightly negative to positive and certainly that top-line trajectory should improve may be. Just to avoid straightlining out the wrong kind profitability into next year, please.","Mike Koppel","Well, Michael, most of the impact on that Trunk Club is going to have next year will be on the impact of how we're treating the -- putting up the assets related to the acquisition and therefore, amortization. So I think we said last time that it would be roughly a 3% to 5% impact going forward. And I think directionally, that's in the ballpark, like I said, as we disclose the details of the purchase accounting you will get more visibility into that.","Operator","And we do have time for one final question. Our final question today is from Bob Drbul from Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi. Good evening. Just a question on -- can you just talk about the trends in like the Boot category and the Outerwear categories as you think about it for Q3 and into Q4?","Pete Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. I mean it's so much that's just heavily reliant on weather. And where you've seen the weather change and evolve, we've had risk sales in those typically cold weather classifications. So we're prepared for it, the weather is going to come, if it's not there already everywhere. And so I think we feel good about the content of our inventory and the balance of it and all that.","So I would think generally, it's been fine, it's been pretty much near plan and that again plays itself out over time. If we look at our day-to-day or even a week-to-week basis a lot of this has to do with the weather. But I'm sure by the end of the quarter, that will tend will balance itself out and we'll be on plan there.","Trina Schurman","Again thank you for today's call. A webcast replay along with a slide presentation will be available for one year on our website. Additionally, you will find an overview of our performance and growth strategy at the end of the slide presentation. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating on today's call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President; and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's third-quarter performance in addition to outlook for fiscal 2015. Joining during the Q&A session will be Erik Nordstrom, Co-President; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Thank you and good afternoon. While we're on track with executing our long-term strategy, I'd like to first comment on our current performance. Over the past couple of years, we've had consistent top line trends, delivering six straight quarters of mid single-digit comp increases.","Beginning in August, we experienced a slowdown across our full-price and off-price businesses. We had a 6.6% increase in total sales and our comp sales were 0.9%, which resulted in third quarter earnings that were below our expectations. While we haven't seen a meaningful change to our customer growth metrics, we did see a decline in our transaction growth relative to the first half of the year. As this softness continued, we've been able to quickly respond, ending the third quarter with inventory aligned with our expected sales plans. As we head into holiday, we don't anticipate a measurable change in current trends and we've made appropriate adjustments to our operating plans, including our inventory levels.","As we look ahead, we remain confident in our strategy, making progress through multiple growth initiatives to enhance the customer experience and serve more customers. In the third quarter, we had an unprecedented number of store openings, with three new full-line stores, one relocation, and 16 Rack stores. This was a noteworthy effort, reflecting our investments and our team's successful execution.","Our total full-price business had a 3.2% sales growth and a comp increase of 0.3%. This includes our continued expansion in Canada, which represents a $1 billion sales opportunity by 2020, with six announced full-line stores and potential for roughly 15 Rack stores. On September 18, we achieved a new milestone with our first international flagship opening in Vancouver, British Columbia. Not only was it the most successful opening we've experienced in our company's history, it is a major step forward in store experience and services. This store will provide learnings as we expand our flagship presence to Toronto next year and later in Manhattan.","In our U.S. full-line businesses, we opened our second store in Minneapolis, our first in Milwaukee, and a relocation in Los Angeles. These stores reflect our latest store design, which are now featured in nine locations. We're also investing in our flagship stores in Chicago and Seattle, which are currently undergoing significant remodels. At Nordstrom.com, we've made ongoing progress on our strategic priorities around selection, convenience and experience. This included expanded selection of roughly 20% and increased capacity with our new East Coast fulfillment center.","Our off-price business inclusive of Rack stores and online had a 12% sales growth and a 2.4% comp increase. This business gives us access to new markets and a pipeline of new and younger customers to Nordstrom. Since the launch of Nordstromrack.com over a year ago, we are finding that the pace of growth is accelerating faster than we anticipated.","To put it in perspective, it took our Nordstrom.com business nearly 15 years to reach $1 billion in sales. From the time we acquired HauteLook in 2011, we expect our online off-price business to achieve this milestone in roughly half that time. Similar to our full-price business, we see meaningful synergies for customers to engage with us across stores and online. We are serving more customers, with 16 additional stores, taking our total Rack store count to 194. Additionally, our online business had a meaningful gain in new customers to Nordstrom over the last year.","Lastly, on October 1 we completed the sale of our credit portfolio to TD Bank. Our mutual commitment to having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly was paramount to this partnership. We're also pleased to be returning $1.8 billion in capital directly to our shareholders through a balanced approach. On October 27, we paid a special cash dividend of $900 million or $4.85 per share, and the remaining proceeds will be applied towards share repurchase. In closing, we are well-positioned through our customer strategy while remaining focused on our current execution.","I'd like to now turn it over to Mike, who will provide more color on our performance and the credit transaction.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Blake. This quarter we experienced a sequential slowdown in sales trends. For several previous quarters, our comp sales were solidly in the mid-single digit range, driving a high-single digit total sales growth. In August, we began to see a slowdown that progressed throughout the quarter, remaining relatively steady at a 1% comp sales trend. As these lower trends persisted, we immediately began to adjust our operating plans, including aligning our inventories with expected sales. Our results reflect those efforts, which included increased markdowns and a reduction in sales plans for the remainder of the year.","We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments and will continue to move forward with our growth strategies, including Canada, eCommerce initiatives and the expansion of our off-price business through new Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com HauteLook, which are performing above expectations.","Our full price business, inclusive of full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Canada, and Trunk Club, grew 3.2% driven by online and new store growth. Canada continues to exceed expectations. Trunk Club is projected to grow at a healthy rate as we position the company to leverage Nordstrom product and introduce Trunk Club for women.","Turning to our off-price business, we continue to invest in stores and online capabilities, which have fueled nearly 20% annualized growth over the last five years. In the third quarter, our off-price sales increased 12%, reflecting online growth that has well surpassed expectations. Since our acquisition of HauteLook less than five years ago, this channel now represents over 10% of our off-price business. In contrast, it took us over 10 years for Nordstrom.com to reach this level of online penetration.","Next we'd like to provide additional color on our gross profit and inventory performance. Gross profit was negatively impacted by below planned sales and higher markdowns, coming in 163 basis points lower than last year. Inventory growth of 8% was in line with sales growth, reflecting adjustments made to align inventory levels with our expected sales plans.","Turning to SG&A, our core operations were well managed with expenses consistent with expectations. Our SG&A rate increased 68 basis points, primarily due to our growth initiatives of Trunk Club, Canada, and fulfillment.","This quarter, we completed the sale of our credit card receivables and would like to provide further detail on that transaction. As previously shared, $1.8 billion of net proceeds are being returned to shareholders evenly split between a special dividend and share repurchase. We recently completed the payment of the dividend and we are now preparing to execute the share repurchase portion, which is expected to begin this quarter.","For 2016, we estimate that the financial impact will be approximately breakeven to earnings per share considering both the retention of roughly 50% of credit EBIT and $900 million of share repurchase. Going forward, we believe this reduction of credit EBIT will narrow based on portfolio growth through TD's partnership.","Finally, let's turn to our 2015 outlook, which incorporates our third quarter performance and an adjustment to our fourth quarter plans based on current sales trends. When excluding the credit transaction impact, our earnings per diluted share outlook is $3.40 to $3.50 compared with the prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.80.","As we look ahead, we remain on track to achieve our sales ambition of $20 billion plus by 2020. To reiterate our long-term expectations, we anticipate improvement in earnings growth beginning in 2016 as we move beyond this year's peak level of investment. More specifically, we expect the gap between sales and earnings growth to narrow over time as our investments deliver earnings accretion.","As we head into the fourth quarter, we are being rigorous in making the appropriate adjustments to our operating plans in response to current sales trends. Over the longer term, we remain confident that the execution of our strategy will deliver top quartile shareholder return.","Now I'll turn the call over to Trina.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We will now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. So as we think about the ROIC, with the credit card transaction now complete and really taking a multi-year view, what level of underlying annual comp and EBIT margin do you guys need to reach that mid-teens goal? Any help just kind of bridging the gap would be great.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Matt. This is Mike. At this point, we're not going to look forward to that level of detail in our plans. We'll share more of our thinking about that in February, but that being said, we still stand behind our ambition to achieve a high single-digit comp sales that will achieve that mid-teens ROIC.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, if I could just follow up with one. As you break down the Rack, so brick and mortar below plan but online clearly above expectations, how are you thinking about the aggregate in total? Any need to potentially slow the growth? Or is this just the online versus brick and mortar that we've been seeing for the last couple of quarters and years across all of retail?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Matt, just to clarify your question that was specifically related to the off-price business?","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Exactly.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","I'm sorry, Matt. This is Blake. Can you restate that for me please one more time? I didn't hear the question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. So just at the Rack question. Just at the Rack, brick and mortar below plan, online above plan, just the best way to think about it going forward in aggregate.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Sure. Thank you. We are mindful of all aspects and measurements of the business, but we look at the business in total through the customers' eyes and as we've been talking about for some time with our full price business and the Nordstrom.com as one unit, same is happening sooner than later with our off-price business. So there are some minor pockets with our growth of some sales transfer, but we really look at it and that's why I made the comment in my remarks as a total. And as a total, we had 12% total growth and comp at 2.4%. We're gaining market share. These are very productive stores with a significant return and we're pleased and confident with our strategy there.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Next is Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on all of the new things that you got done in this quarter, the store openings, the credit transaction, et cetera. Just curious about performance across merchandise categories, when you started to see the slowdown, what were you pleased with? What were you not pleased with? Weather impact? Just any color you could provide on what's working and what isn't and how you've adjusted?","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Sure. Dorothy, this is Jamie. I'll take that one. I think the trend was pretty darn consistent throughout the third quarter starting in August, so no real change throughout the quarter. In terms of merchandise categories, it was really across the board. I think the categories that have been strong for us all year continue to be strong. Our beauty business has definitely been a bright spot. Our younger customer business particularly around our Savvy, Topshop businesses continue to be above trend. It's interesting in terms of seasonal things. Our coat business is really strong. And so, there's really nothing to point to in terms of merchandise category that would give you any more color on that. It's really kind of across-the-board lower transactions.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","So traffic is really the big issue?","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","I think that's right.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Yeah, okay.","Operator","Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Paul.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Question on the traffic issue then. You spoke to seeing the slowdown in August. It's the same throughout the quarter and you do not expect it to bounce here in the fourth quarter. Have you guys kind of been able to do some digging and see what has led to that slowdown, especially given that it is throughout all the formats and online? What do you think is behind this?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Paul, this is Mike. Clearly, there's been a lot of commentary out there as to what potentially is causing this. It might be one, it might be all. At this point, our point of view is what we can do about it is we can adjust our operating plans, we can continue to manage our inventories appropriately and we could ensure that our stores and our website has the right stuff to sell. And that's what we're doing.","Operator","Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much. Mike, I'm wondering if there is an opportunity to take a look at the marketing budget or the channels of marketing that you're using to see if there might be a way to drive traffic to the stores or the website. I'm just wondering, is there any actions you can take in either the near term, meaning the fourth quarter, or looking out into 2016 and 2017 that you think might impact that traffic change?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Kimberly. This is something that's an element of how we run our business all the time. We have a lot of resources available to us whether it's online marketing, whether it's more traditional forms of marketing that drive traffic. That being said, we also evaluate what's the value of that last dollar spent and its ability to drive more business and we look at that very closely as well. We have a very rigorous plan in place for holiday that's around traditional periods of traffic as well as a gifting program. And that's something that we continue to elevate every year. So we are going to continue to do those kinds of things and we expect that those will help improve our business.","Operator","Next is Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you very much. Regarding the markdowns and kind of cleaning the inventories. Which classifications did you conduct that most on? And we just wanted to ask you a little bit more about Rack. The comp on the bricks and mortar decelerated on a two-year stack. Were there tweaks that you would have made? Or what happened with the product assortment there? If there's anything specific to call out, that would be helpful.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Hey, Oliver. This is Jamie. I'll take the first part of that. In terms of markdowns, like I mentioned earlier, there wasn't really any specific call-out in terms of category. The team in our Nordstrom Merchandising group, as usual, did a great job of reacting to the trends in our business. We're in the fashion business and there's an ebb and flow there and our team is pretty good at reacting and managing as things are going up and things are going down. So we feel pretty darn good about our inventory position going into the fourth quarter and our ability to continue to react to business as it changes. Blake, do you want to take the next part?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Sure, Oliver. This is Blake. On behalf of the Rack team, if we were to go back maybe six, nine months and look at our plans and how we executed our merchandising plans, we felt really good about it. And a number of improvements we felt were made from previous year in trends. And so the bottom line is the customer and sales are the truth.","And so though we might focus on specifics where we thought we had improvement with value or flow or assortment or the editing process or how we turned the corner in the fall, there just were a number of initiatives that encouraged us to be able to meet and exceed our plans. But as you pointed out, we fell short of our plans. So overall this is a very profitable, highly productive business. We think we're doing the right fundamental things. We like our strategy there, but we are very mindful of that reduction in comps and we're working on that on a day-to-day basis.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oliver, this is Mike. I just wanted to add one more comment to add on to Jamie's comments around inventory. The speed with which we responded to the situation has put us in a position that not only are inventories aligned and on plan, but they're also current. And that is very important because first place, the early markdown has the best value and having current inventory allows us to flow in the latest stuff. And so, while it created some disappointment in order; we believe it continues to position us well going forward.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And could you just brief us on what do you think is happening with the customer because customers do have a certain amount of extra money, but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere so clearly. Because I just wanted your thoughts on that because it's been a very confusing retail tape.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Oliver, this is Blake, and we've said this many times. We're not economists, we're merchants. And we concur with you that if you get to a higher altitude and you look at the scorecard, there are a number of economic indicators that look real positive for U.S. and the consumer and spending yet all we can tell you is in our business, we saw a slowdown. And it was across the board, as Jamie talked about. It wasn't regionally or a merchandise region or a channel. We saw, compared to our plans, a very similar reduction again across the board and it went for the whole quarter, and that's why we felt strongly that we should plan accordingly for the fourth quarter that way.","So we're going to get after it each day. I think the key thing is what Mike talked about with the inventories. We believe we're in a strong position. We are not on our heels. We think we can react to the customer, we think we have the type of functionality and experiences the customer is desirous of. But ultimately the customer is saying something right now in retail, in our niche, and we need to get after it","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you for the transparency. And best regards for the holiday.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You too, Oliver. Thanks.","Operator","Next is Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the comments about the gap between sales and earnings growth narrowing. Is there a certain comp that you'll need to leverage SG&A next year and also are there any SG&A cuts that could happen if sales don't reaccelerate?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Lorraine, this is Mike. As I said earlier, at this point in time, we're not going to go into a comp discussion. We'll talk about more of that in February. Historically the model has leverage at a low single-digit comp. Part of what we're all learning at this point is that was a model that was built off of a mall-based distribution network, and now we have malls and we have the internet.","And so the business model does look a little different and we're continuing to refine how we think about it and how we invest in it. In terms of anything we're looking at, going forward, the areas that we're seeing the biggest growth in outsized investment are in technology, in our fulfillment and in our online marketing. And we continue to look at opportunities there to ensure that that last dollar that we're investing is creating value. So those are the areas that I think we'll, over time, continue to evaluate.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Joan Payson with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I was just taking a look at the dynamic in terms of the cost associated with Canada and Trunk Club, which looked like they're coming in maybe a little bit heavier this year than anticipated, and the enabler cost may be coming in a little bit lighter. So could you just help us think about, as we begin to look at next year, how those dynamics could begin to shift?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well, this is Mike talking. The things that are driving that is number one, Trunk Club, we acquired roughly a year ago. And so, we should see that start to moderate as we anniversary primarily the amortization of the acquisition costs and on a year-over-year basis the impact starts to narrow. And then the second thing is Canada. With the opening of several new stores and the under-construction of a number of stores, we saw some outsized expense growth to support that. Next year, the impact of that should basically be neutral on a year-over-year basis. So we should start to see a little relief and you're seeing it in the fourth quarter. That chart we presented I think shows that the impact of those items really start to neutralize when we hit the fourth quarter.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And how would the \u2013 do you expect the enabler costs to progress going forward?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think the enabler cost was primarily there at the fulfillment center and we should see that basically moderate over time as well.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Next is Bob Drbul with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. I just had two quick questions. The first one is, in a period where you're transitioning with the inventory, is the movement \u2013 is there any inventory that goes above the trend from the Nordstrom full-line stores to the Rack in terms of allocation? And the second question is, Mike, is on the share repurchase plans now with the proceeds, is an accelerated share repurchase a possibility?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Well, Bob. This is Blake. I'll take the inventory question, the first part, and Mike will get the second. Ultimately, if we have sales challenges in the full-line stores then that transfer of goods rolls to the Rack. We need to then adjust the special purchase of the close-outs we buy around that and our Rack team is working on it.","As we mentioned, our inventories in total for the company are in line. So the Rack, it's important that they stay fluid for, whether it's returns throughout the various channels, how the customer wants to shop, those vagaries (27:09) and also the changes that can take place in full-line. But there's nothing noteworthy at this moment. What was a little bit noteworthy we called out is, we proactively took some additional markdowns to ensure that we were addressing slow sellers and we were getting this stuff sold. And so that did have an impact on margin.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Blake. Bob, in terms of the ASR, yes, an ASR is part of the several alternatives we're looking at as we look at starting to deploy that excess capital in the fourth quarter.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Paul L. Lejuez - Citi","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just wondering on the gross margin pressure if you saw more in the full-price business versus the Rack. Maybe just \u2013 can you talk about what you saw in each of those two businesses? And then, separately, any thoughts about relaxing the credit standards on the credit card as you guys determined with TD what the right standards are? Are you guys running at a very low rate of write-off, bad debt. Just wondering if there's any thought to maybe use that as a potential driver of top line? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Well, Paul, this is Blake. We actually saw a little bit of the opposite of what you described. The full-line was fairly consistent with their margin performance this year versus last year, and Racks were down slightly due to increased markdowns. And, I guess, the biggest contributor to that would be, we're really pleased the online off-price part of the business. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook.","The vast majority of the HauteLook customers were engaging in a return or visiting our Rack and we think that's a real plus for the company. But that's generated a comparison from last year, some more markdowns to move some of those goods. So totally for Nordstrom I think it's a good thing but Rack incurred some more markdowns on that.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Paul, in terms of your question on credit standards. A couple of things I would say. The first thing is, we've always tried to build a long-term relationship with our customer through our credit card, and the customers that have joined us and that have opened accounts have been very loyal.","As a matter fact, this year we're on track to open another million new accounts and we've opened those accounts with the same credit standards we've always had. So in terms of using that as a lever, I think we would be very thoughtful and cautious about that. Sometimes those generate near-term sales but don't necessarily generate the healthiest sales. And so, we'll continue to look at that as perhaps pockets of opportunity, but I wouldn't say that that is a material lever to impacting sales.","Paul L. Lejuez - Citi","Got you. And just as a follow up on Blake's answer. The Rack, weaker margins at Rack, is that a function of having more product that came from the full-line business? If you can maybe share what percent of Rack merchandise was from full-line versus source specifically for Rack this quarter versus last year?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","I'm sorry. I wasn't clear on that Paul. I thought I mentioned that it came from predominantly HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com. The full-line store transfers were fairly consistent and weren't material from previous years, so that margin and that performance is fairly similar. It was an uptick due to how the customer wants to conduct business. In this case, do some returns in the stores, which is fine, but it just created a difference this year versus last year, a little bit of an apples and oranges.","Paul L. Lejuez - Citi","Got you. Sorry, I misunderstood. Good luck, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Next is Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Just a real quick question on SG&A. It looks like on a lowered sales forecast, you're still looking for relatively similar SG&A change as a percent of sales, 70 basis points, 75 basis points...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","...instead of 60 basis points. So does that imply that you have made some adjustments downward in your expenses? And if so, where would that be? Because it would seem that if you're in an investment mode, that would be a fixed bucket, particularly in Q4?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Jeff, one thing to keep in mind is we have a relatively meaningful variable cost model, both in the stores and online. So when we reduced our sales expectation, some of those variable costs did come down. And then, of course, we're making some other adjustments as it relates to a softer top line, but those adjustments are not related to the investments we're making for the long term.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Where would it be, Mike? Any area in particular? Would it be store selling, home office?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jeff, I'm not going to get into too much detail on that. But I will tell you based on the fact that our stores are 100% commissioned in the regular price, lower sales would mean that you'd have lower selling cost.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Good afternoon.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Neely.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Did you dig into any of the looking at the customer cohorts on the Rewards programs like levels one through four to see if they're behaving differently? Are your higher value customers actually dropping off more versus the one? I know you guys haven't really seen much, but I'm just kind of curious to ask that question framed up a little bit there.","Then on anniversary sale, for Blake maybe or someone else on the team, it's historically been I think a pretty decent predictor for you guys for holiday has been at least our observation. And it was a good anniversary sale. Clearly, the customer is responding to some newness in fashion. We're just trying to bridge why the drop off.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","If it's a fashion related issue. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Neely. Thank you. In terms of your question on the loyalty side, no, we haven't seen a material change in the cohort, the segmentation, however you want to talk about it in terms of how that customer is behaving.","As I said earlier, we continue to add new customers onto our loyalty program. I think we had mentioned earlier that in Canada, we've had a non-tender program that is now generating over 60% of our sales there and it continues to be a very good story there. So I wouldn't say that that affected any of the top-line change.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Neely, this is Jamie. I'll take the second part. So on the anniversary sale, we did have a good event this year. The one thing that's changed about that event over the last number of years is that it's become increasingly about current buy now, wear now merchandise as opposed to, as you recall in years past, where it was people buying a lot of fall goods that they put in their closets for a couple months.","So I think the anniversary is probably been a little bit less of a predictor of fall than it was 5, 10 plus years ago. That being said, again, I'd reiterate that there's really not a seasonal component to where we've seen transactions slow down. Our coat business has been really strong, having big increases. It's just a traffic thing. We've got less people buying clothes this quarter than we expected and there's really nothing else to point to.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Can I just follow up with what's one of your worst-performing categories? You mentioned what some of your better performing categories are. But if you were going to rank what some of your underperforming categories are, what are they? Thank you.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Yeah, we don't really have anything dead at the bottom that's really dragging us down. I know you're looking for something that's dragging us down. There's really not. Everything is really at the same trend that it's been at least for the last few quarters. We feel good about a lot of the initiatives that we've been talking about the last year or two, particularly women's apparel.","We continue to see really great opportunities there that we're continuing forward on in beauty. In boots \u2013 I'm sorry, in shoes, boot business has been really strong for a few years. That's leveled off, but I wanted to say that it's a category that's dragging us down. It's just like every category took a step down in terms of trend and that's about it.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Yeah, Neely, and this is Blake. I just would underscore Jamie's comments because in the past, we could talk about variances within the regions and within the merchandise divisions and you could get after it. Outside of the call-out that Jamie made at the beginning about beauty leading the way, everyone else is in a pretty tight band. The basis point difference between, outside of beauty, the top performer and the bottom is pretty tight and we don't think it's material and that's why we're not calling out because there isn't anything to be gleaned from that.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Good luck out there, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Neely.","Operator","Next is Charles Grom with CRT Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Not to beat a dead horse, but to follow up on Paul's question. Is there anything that you guys are seeing today across your customer or across product category that remind you guys of what happened in 2007, 2008 when your business started to slow? Because it's definitely not a Nordstrom issue, right. You got Whole Foods comping negative, Macy's is comping negative. There seems to be something out there. So I'm just curious if you guys have seen anything that gives you any playback to back to that period?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Charles, this is Mike and I'll take a swing at the same question as well. Clearly, this is not as dramatic as what we saw in 2008, 2009, which was a pretty significant change. We went from what was a mid-single-digit comp trend to a low single-digit comp trend. As the guy said, we've seen it across geography. We've seen it whether it's in-store, online. We've seen it by category. But it certainly is at not that level of drama that we saw during that period. But you know what? One of the things that we have noted is that it did kind of reach this new plateau and kind of stayed there, and that is what gave us very clear evidence that we needed to respond and respond quickly.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","And I think I would add that it's really apples and oranges. It was a dramatic economic change that took place there at that time, and we have the opposite to a degree here. We have some positive economic indicators, but the customer is voting with their dollars in a manner were she or he came closer to the best here and all we can do is talk about our business. And what we saw in the third quarter was a reduction, about 400 basis points across the board our business. It wasn't the wholesale change we saw in that 2008 time period, but it's material because our plans were for a higher performance and it has an effect. We're pleased with how our team is responding and we think we're in a good position for the fourth quarter. We think we're being prudent on how we're planning it and time will tell if we execute that properly.","Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thanks for the color. And good luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Next is Michael Binetti with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good evening. I wanted to ask you, the level of the gross margin compression in the quarter was a little bit counterintuitive to me, even as I sit and listen to you guys talk through some of the decisions you made in the quarter and the level of sales you saw. I'm just curious. Does the third quarter gross margin \u2013 did you take some marks and write them down in the third quarter that you expect for the fourth quarter or is the majority of the incremental markdown and clearance that you think will occur in the fourth quarter as you reset your sales plan, is that going to still occur predominantly in the fourth quarter?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Michael. This is Mike. The markdowns that caused the compression in the third quarter were directly aligned to what we said earlier. And that is, we saw a sales trend that was significantly different from our operating plans, which resulted in creating inventory risks. So we took markdowns so we could liquidate that inventory, sell it through, and assure that we were on plan. Now we've also considered that with the slower sales environment in the fourth quarter that we might have a higher markdown level as well and we've considered that in the guidance that we've given you.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Okay. Obviously, the questions are going this way, but I think people are having a little hard time piecing together all the data points we're picking up across the space right now.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Some of the other names we've talked that I think Chuck mentioned have been a little bit slower build was the sales accelerated a little bit more quickly here for you. We're trying to figure out what happened. As we think ahead, if we look at the range of comps you gave for the fourth quarter, what is your instinct on what would accelerate in your business to get to the high end of that comp range in the fourth quarter?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Michael, again, it goes back to \u2013 I think both Jamie and Blake mentioned that it appears that there has been a slowdown in overall demand from the customer who was purchasing what we sell. And what would cause us to get back to the higher end is that customer reigniting their demand. And I don't think it's any more than that. There's probably a multitude of data points out there that are driving some of this. But in the end, we can only do what we can do from our perspective and we believe we've done it.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","And, Michael, this is Jamie. I think that's right. I would just add that we've taken the appropriate adjustments to our plans, but our inventory is current, and we feel really good about our plans for the fourth quarter in terms of our merchandise assortment, our marketing plans. We're going into fourth quarter all guns blazing.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Sure.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","And we're clearly a little more conservative in our planning, given recent sales trends. We feel good about our plan to hit those numbers. But if trends change then we'll feel even better about that. But we're optimistic that our customers will respond to what we're going to put forth over the next couple of months.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","If I could just ask, Mike, one last one. It's been a long journey for you walking us back to a point where like some very heavy investing over the past few years will lead to the earnings growth rate starting to improve closer to the revenue growth rate next year. I mean, if we are in a new normal for the level of sales across the industry, not for you guys or anyone in particular. But if we are in a new normal, I mean, how would you think about lower top-line opportunity versus the investments? We know you guys want to make for the long term, but you've also said that your earnings growth rate will go up next year. Is it something where if the sales rate is going to be slower, you guys would start to try and look at ways to try to bring the cost down a little bit to try and stick to that guidance for 2016? Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The answer is yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Which part?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The answer...","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I know I'm going to look at the transcript and it's going to be a long question.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's good, Michael. We can have a little back and forth here. No, no. The answer is yes that we would look to reduce the acceleration of our investment\/cost as related to those initiatives.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Howard Tubin with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Yes. This is Paula (44:01) calling in for Howard. Just talking about igniting demand and interest. With regards to the Savvy department, can you tell us if there are any upcoming rollouts with regard to Madewell or Topshop or anything in the upcoming holiday period that we should be excited about that will continue the positive momentum there?","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Sure. This is Jamie. Yeah, well, it starts with a consistent flow of fresh new goods and that drives all of our business. But particularly in the Savvy department, our ability to always have something new to show the customer really drives our success there, and we feel good about our plans over the next couple of months. You mentioned Topshop, we have Topshop in 70 odd stores. We're increasing that to over 90 by the end of the year. That's been a real positive business for us and our partnership with them is really strong. We have Madewell in approximately 30 stores, and that's been performing really well. Another brand that we're happy with right now is Brandy Melville \u2013 thank you, excuse me \u2013 in our Juniors department, Brandy Melville's a brand that we've added to a number of stores and our customers have really responded.","So our ability to find ways of continuing to be relevant to particularly younger customers who are shopping with us maybe for the first time and we've acquired a lot of customers. Our metrics around customer acquisition continue to be very strong, which gives us a lot of confidence as we continue to execute these plans and look towards the future.","Unknown Speaker","Great.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now introduce Rob Campbell, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin, sir.","Robert E. Campbell","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include about 30 minutes for your questions.","As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom, Inc.; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's first quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2013. During the Q&A session, we will be joined by Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Stores.","Before we begin, I want to mention that Blake and Mike will be using slides that can be viewed in the Investor Relations section of our website. If you are listening to this conference call's webcast, you should already see the title slide. If you are listening by telephone, you can view the slides by going to nordstrom.com and the Investor Relations section.","And now I'll turn over the call to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter for us reflected continued progress on our strategic priorities of improving the customer experience, enhancing our merchandise offering, increasing relevance with existing and new customers and driving online growth. From a top line perspective, the increase was at the lower end of our expectations, with particular softness in more seasonal merchandise categories and in several geographic markets. Sales trends showed improvement in April, and throughout the quarter we were disciplined in our management of expenses and inventory. We remain positive about the balance of the year as we stay focused on our efforts to deliver the kind of customer experience across all channels that build loyalty and drive sales.","As we've discussed over the last 12 months, we have multiple growth opportunities underway to improve the customer experience in our stores, in e-commerce and in the multichannel synergies between them. This quarter, we opened 5 Rack stores, with an additional 3 stores opened today in Maryland, Alabama and Maine. We plan to open 14 more Racks over the balance of 2013 and have over 230 Rack stores by the end of 2016.","During the quarter, we also announced our plans for a second full-line store in Toronto to be located in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre, bringing our announced full-line store total in Canada to 5, thus far.","One of the ways in which we increase our relevance with customers is through product innovation. Within the Women's Apparel area which continues to perform above our multichannel average, we repositioned our Savvy department during the quarter to maintain its trendy fashion appeal but at more accessible prices. It's too early to evaluate its overall performance, but we're excited about this important strategic change to further enhance our product offering and build on the learnings from our partnership with Topshop.","The Topshop merchandise has performed well online and in the 14 stores where we currently carry it. Based on its success, we plan to expand its distribution to additional stores in the fall.","As the functionality of our mobile point-of-sale devices continues to expand, it is allowing our full-line store salespeople to spend more time with customers and offer a more seamless shopping experience. In the Rack, we've been able to improve the service level through using mobile point-of-sale devices to reduce and often eliminate the checkout line.","The next step which we took in the first quarter was to remove some of our fixed cash registers and capture over 20,000 square feet of incremental selling space. This is meaningful because of the high sales productivity we achieve in the Rack.","In e-commerce, our focus has been on strengthening the customer experience through a focus on selection, convenience and experience. We've expanded the breadth of our online merchandise offering, so that today it virtually is at parity with our store offering and will continue to grow. In terms of convenience, during the quarter we added well over 100 new features to the website, made improvements to our mobile apps and increased the speed of fulfillment and delivery. We're still in the early stages in the area of personalization. In essence, customizing the experience on our site, providing product recommendations and building tools that help with fit and style. We're also making substantial investments in the infrastructure of our systems to support our accelerated pace and growth.","Our Fashion Rewards program continues to grow with new accounts running ahead of last year. We now have 3.5 million active members, up from 2.9 million at this time last year. We've long recognized the program's ability to attract and deepen relationships with new and existing customers, and we're pleased that our customers are taking advantage of it.","During the second quarter, we'll offer customers the ability to open a Fashion Rewards account online and have immediate shopping access, including participation in the Early Access portion of the Anniversary Sale. The second quarter is a particularly high-volume period for us, with our Men's and Women's Half-Yearly sales followed by the Anniversary Sale that begins on Friday, July 19. These events bring strong traffic into our stores and online, and give us meaningful opportunities to establish and strengthen our relationships with customers.","In closing, we remain positive about the balance of the year. We're motivated by the strategic growth opportunities we're pursuing and we're on track in terms of our progress. We'll continue to update you as we go throughout the year.","And now I'll turn over the call to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. Consistent with what we've shared with you in recent quarters, we continue to focus on the execution of our long-term growth strategy that encompasses multiple channels and an expanding geography. To date, we are on track in terms of our progress with respect to our planned entry into Canada, our accelerated store expansion in the Rack, our aggressive growth in e-commerce and ongoing full-line store growth. The potential these initiatives offer in terms of the expansion of customers we serve and the differentiated experience we provide is significant, both individually by channel and in the synergy created across channels. Our confidence and commitment to the successful execution of these initiatives remains strong.","Turning to the results of the current quarter, I'd like to offer a few comments. Our sales performance resulted in year-over-year growth, although lower than anticipated. As Blake mentioned, we experienced softer sales trends early in the quarter in both seasonal merchandise categories and geographically in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. That being said, we did see improvement in April sales trends, and our outlook for the balance of the year remains positive.","For the first quarter, earnings per diluted share of $0.73 came in at the lower end of our expectations, which was fully attributable to lower-than-planned sales volume. We delivered a same-store sales increase of 2.7%, while going up against last year's 8.5% improvement. The Direct business showed continued momentum, generating 25% sales growth on top of last year's 44% growth. Additionally, total Rack sales grew by 10%.","Women's Apparel achieved same-store sales increases above the multichannel average. The strength in our regular price selling continued, reflecting our customers' preference for newness and fashion. The percentage of regular-price sales matched last year's recent historical high for the first quarter.","Overall, operating disciplines were very encouraging. We began the year with inventory in good shape and we were able to exit the quarter in a great position, which sets us up well for the high-volume second quarter. This includes the incremental merchandise investment to support Rack growth. On the expense side, our variable costs were well controlled and our overhead was in line with plan.","Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $275 million, representing a decrease of $5 million or 2% from last year. While we achieved the sales increase of 4.8%, it was offset by planned expenses related to our growth. These included incremental expenses attributable to our strategic investments in Rack, Canada, e-commerce and our loyalty program. We previously shared with you estimated costs of $20 million to $25 million for 2013 associated with our entry into Canada and accelerated Rack expansion, and we incurred roughly $6 million in the first quarter.","Next, I'd like to provide some additional color on our long-term growth investment. As mentioned in our fourth quarter call, we are planning capital investments of $3.7 billion over the next 5 years. 75% of our plan consists of investments in stores, reflecting their importance in building and supporting our brand, while leveraging our multichannel presence. The remaining 25% or roughly $900 million represents e-commerce and technology initiatives. Approximately 1\/3 of that $900 million relates to our fulfillment capabilities, largely through expanding capacity. The remaining 2\/3 represent technology investments to improve the customer experience and to strengthen our infrastructure to support the growth of the business and the accelerated pace of change.","We continue to believe our level of investment is appropriate, positioning us to serve more customers and deliver on an ever-changing experience consistent with what customers expect from our brand. Our 5-year capital plan represents approximately 5% of sales, which is in line where we have been historically and consistent with what has been the spend level over time for growing and adapting companies in our sector.","We remain committed to our long-term financial goals of mid-teens ROIC, along with high single-digit sales growth. In 2012, our ROIC of 13.9% was the highest over the last 5 years, a period in which we invested nearly $2 billion in our business. Our first quarter ROIC was 14%, 90 basis points higher than a year ago. With our investments continuing in 2013, we expect ROIC to continue to grow.","We are in a strong financial position. For some time, we've applied a balanced approach to capital allocation, which takes into account our strategic investments, combined with returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $166 million and we have $1 billion remaining under current authorizations. During the quarter, we also replaced 2 credit facilities, having a combined capacity of $800 million with a single 5-year $800 million borrowing facility.","Now I'd like to address our current outlook for the year. We recognize that it is still early, with the first quarter typically representing the lightest sales volume. While we did experience slightly softer sales than expected, we believe that our plan for the remainder of the year is appropriate. As such, we are maintaining our view of 2013 earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80, which includes the impact of first quarter share repurchases of approximately $0.05. Our top line view has been adjusted to reflect the lower-than-planned volume in the first quarter.","In closing, we continue to be excited about the many opportunities we have to serve more customers, with great product and an unmatched customer experience through our expanding channels and new geographies.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] With that, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","On the slides, you had a -- I think it was a Rack inventory slide, maybe it was a full business slide, and you had something called the pack-away Rack inventory. Could you talk a little bit about that? And whether that's a new strategy or not?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Ed. This is Mike. Thanks for your question. Yes. The pack and hold is a strategy that we began last year, and the idea there is to be more assertive in the market to get the best product we can as we transition out of the season. And with the continued growth in our Rack business and the improvement in our partnership across all our channels, we're just getting more scale and more leverage, and we're able to get better inventory. And that increase in inventory represents that investment.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And one quick follow-up. Thank you for the table to kind of help us with the quarterly trends due to calendar shift, but I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more quantification in terms of the magnitude of difference between 2Q and 3Q based on the week shifting?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Ed, we're not giving specific direction by quarter. I think we did talk a little bit about that second quarter would be higher than average, and the back half would be lower.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question today is from Deborah Weinswig from Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you comment on traffic versus ticket in the quarter? And just how should we think about kind [ph] of things as they progress throughout the quarter?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Traffic versus ticket, is it the question?","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, yes.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, there was a certainly a softness throughout the quarter. April was better, more return to normal. We had more softness in the first 2 months of the quarter regionally, in our Northeast capital, which is the Mid-Atlantic and our Midwest regions. So there was definitely some softness there.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And it does seem like the Nordstrom Rack definitely bucked that trend. Can you comment on that business specifically?","Michael G. Koppel","Deborah, this is Mike. I just wanted to just make one more comment on that. In terms of the average ticket in the first quarter, our regular-price selling was as good as it's ever been, and the average ticket was up. So we continue to see good progress there. And then the second part was the Rack? Second question was the Rack?","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I said Rack definitely seemed very strong in the quarter. I just wanted to see if you could comment on that business specifically?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Deborah, this is Blake. Our Rack business continues to perform well, but it also mirrored to a degree that full-line stores, from a comp store point of view, but we're very pleased overall with it and its strategy and the new store growth is going on plan and, in some cases, exceeding our plan. So we still feel good about that but it was interesting that it's had a healthy trend for some time. And it came down a notch during the quarter, but a similar trend or a reflection of the full-line stores.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar Investment Research.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","We keep talking about the regular-price selling and how it's getting better, and it feels like you keep reaching new highs. Is there any reason that, that would not continue, or that, eventually, you might not want to have that high a level or something that could reverse? Or should that just continue to get stronger as you keep getting smarter about business?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete.  I mean, it was really just reflective of what customers are interested in buying from us. And I -- we -- it actually served us really well that we have a good full-price business that is reliant on newness and all that. And we geared everything that we do in terms of how we flow inventory to be along those lines. We don't have the same kind of margin pressures given the markdowns, which is a good position for us to be in, and frankly, serves us well when dealing with customers, too. We're in a position we have to match prices, and that sometimes affects it because most of our peers are more promotional than we are, as we know -- as you know. But all in all, it's been a good positive trajectory for us to be on, and we've just been trying to follow our customers' lead with what they're most interested in buying from  Nordstrom.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is it kind of equal Rack to full-line stores?","Peter E. Nordstrom","It's a little bit different. I mean, obviously, there is a different agenda happening in the Rack where the whole premise is around markdowns and what have you. But we -- I think, relative to that, we have good sell-throughs at our first marked price. And I don't know, Blake, if you can expand on that.","Blake W. Nordstrom","I will -- this is Blake, I will concur with Pete. It's a little bit of a different animal full-line to Racks, but in terms of the regular-price selling particularly as we understand it amongst the peer group, we have one of the highest regular price business within the Rack. And that first markdown, hopefully, we're pricing it accordingly is moving well. And so that helps. And given their flow and their margins and there's a similar story, if you will, with the full-line stores even though there's some -- there's a different model there slightly.","Operator","Our next question today is from Bob Drbul From Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Joan Payson on for Bob today. I guess, if you could speak more to the Fashion Rewards program, given the penetration today, just maybe what your long-term plans are, and when you think that growth and penetration will begin to slow? And then is there any difference in behavior for rewards customers?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Joan, this is Mike. In terms of the program, we're still enjoying the momentum that was built last year when we introduced what we called Fashion Rewards 2.0, which was the next level of our offering, where we enhanced the benefits and we made it more accessible to more customers. And that momentum continues. We did, this past fall, do some testing on a non-tender-based program and we're learning from that, and we're going to continue to move forward and see ways that we can reach more customers through loyalty. In terms of their behavior, those customers spend several times more on the average than non-Fashion Reward customers, and clearly, their loyalty has a very high lifetime customer value. So those customers continue to be a core for us. With the expansion into the Rack, we're acquiring new customers at a younger stage of their buying cycle. And so those are all positives. So we're going to continue to learn from it and find ways to grow it.","Operator","Our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","I apologize. We'll move on to the next question. Our next question today is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on some of the things that you're doing in Women's Apparel. Obviously, with Savvy, you've changed the pricing there, some of the departments seem to have moved around. I think, if I'm not mistaken, t.b.d is not there anymore. It seems like denim has moved kind of within the department. So I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the changes you've made there and how customers are responding?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I feel like I got to run down to the floor and make sure t.b.d. didn't fall into the ocean or something, because we haven't moved that one. That's kind of been business as usual there for the most part. If anything we're -- pretty much have expanded our offer there. We did make a change with Savvy and was mostly just around trying to be more competitive, what's happening out there in the landscape of being able to buy a trend right [ph] clothes at lower prices than what we were offering, so we dropped our average price point considerably. And that has made a really interesting difference for us. In total, it's really benefited Women's Apparel. We're still trying to gain traction on this change. I think, to your point, that some stuff has moved around, and that's been somewhat unsettling to some customers. And we've been through this before, so we know it's going to take a little bit of time. But I'd say the early indications of this has been a good thing to do and it's going to enable us to attract more new customers. So I'd say, really, the success of Women's, that's part of it, but there's a couple of things that happened there. First of all, we've done a much better job of prioritizing and editing around disproportionate spend on key brands. Obviously, that's how customers tend to be able to navigate our stores based on these brands they expect to find from us, and we've invested more heavily in them with more inventory. We've given them more prominent locations and merchandising features on the floor, and the business has gone up quite a bit. So that's been a good move for us. We've also had a lot of improvement with our own label, what we call NPG, or Nordstrom Product Group. We've had really good success with our private label brands in Women's and really excellent growth, which has not only been great for the top line, but it's very good for our margins as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","With Topshop then maybe any productivity metrics?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Could you repeat that question, please?","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. Topshop, can you give us any more details on your store rollout? How many do you think you'll have this year and maybe next year? And then, any details you can share on productivity?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. We're planning on opening some new stores this fall. It's been successful so far with the 14 stores we started out with. It's got to happen in some kind of measured pace because there's a lot that goes with this, and not the least of which is the amount of investment and effort it takes to give it the proper identity and location in our floors. And so we're working closely with the Topshop people to identify the stores, the locations and the specific merchandising elements it needs. So we're planning in, I think, late September, early October to add 28 stores at this point, that's what we've agreed upon, and we're working through those details with them. And presuming it will go as we all think it will continue to go that we would be able to follow up with another approximately 30 the next season. When I say that, more like January, February. Again, and I think it behooves both Topshop and us to -- once we've decided and figured  out that this is good and worth doing, to get it going as quickly as reasonably possible, so that's -- we're aligned on that. And I would say, in general, it's been productive and more productive than an average department in Women's. So when you combine that with the fact that it attracts a lot of new customers as well, it's been a good thing for us.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe can you just elaborate more on what exactly the investment looks like from a dollar perspective?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, I'm not going to get into the details of that. But it's fair to say that it's not trivial. To do this right and do it well in a way that they're happy and we're happy, we don't want to do this in a temporary looking way. We want to do it in a way that looks like we're serious about the business. So those details get worked out. We have a great partnership with Topshop that we share a lot of those costs.","Michael G. Koppel","This is Mike. It's also, I think, fair to say that the expectations of the returns on wherever we're investing are very high. This is a significant opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Mike, I wanted to talk a little bit more about Fashion Rewards, if we could. I know that you guys have been testing that non-tender-based card. I'm just curious in those tests, if you could be a little bit more specific as to how you tested it and what you found? Did you test it full-line in Rack or both, or just one of them? And then related to that, is there going to be an additional rollout of this around pre-shop? Is that kind of what you guys were talking about in terms of being able to sign up for the Fashion Rewards online doing pre-shop? Is that the connector there? And then just one tiny, little additional, if I may. In terms of mobile iPhone functionality, you guys have definitely been ahead of the curve. We've been tracking it pretty closely. It does seem to me, though, that there's opportunity -- there's always endless opportunity -- but there's opportunity to really put more information around Fashion Rewards in your customers' hand. What's the timeline for something like that on the docket?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, Neely, thank you. I tried to write down all those questions. I'll do my best to address them. The first is the test. The test we did was primarily full-line and in Cosmetics. That was an area that we felt certainly was an opportunity to enhance loyalty and repeat business. I'm not going to get into too many specifics in terms of what we learned, other than the fact that we do see opportunity down the road to have more of a non-tender offering. We are currently in the process of building and investing in the technology that would give us a better platform, not only with the Fashion Rewards on our tender program but also non-tender. So we learned enough to validate that I think there's opportunity to move forward. In terms of the pre-shop, I think what we were talking about in Blake's comments was the fact that we're going to have the functionality to apply for a card online and get immediate approval, so then you can turn around and shop online. And as you know, for Anniversary Sale, the pre-shop is only open for Fashion Rewards customers. So the fact that you can go on, apply, get approval, you can pre-shop online at that point. And so we see that as another opportunity, not only to get more customers in the program, but also to offer them the convenience of the pre-shop for Anniversary. And then, the mobile iPhone, E, you want to cover that?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Erik. Mobile, we're not going to get into our exact rollout schedule. But you are right, there is a big opportunity to utilize mobile to get relevant information in the hands of the customers, and Fashion Rewards is certainly high on the list for us. It's a program that our customers have responded really well to. And the more we can engage it in, the better it is for us. So I'll tell you, it's on our list along with other features to get relevant information to our customers' hands.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","You guys have made great success with Women's, and so I have questions on 2 different departments. One, I wondered if you could talk about Encore? It appears the performance is improving after underperformance for what seemed like many years. And I wondered if you're eliminating Encore in some of your stores and spreading plus sizes throughout other departments. That's my first question.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. Encore, we actually have had some improvement in the last 8 months or so, and largely it's been because our online business there has grown disproportionately fast to everything else. We've had big increases online with the Encore department. It's been more closer to flat in the stores, but that's where we've had the growth. I think because of that, we've learned that, perhaps it doesn't have to be in every store. I mean, every store is different based on the space constraints that we have and the customers that we have in the store. But if we can serve that customer well online, we're anxious to do that. I think every store, we have to evaluate and prioritize. I think the worst thing that we can do is to try to do a bunch of departments in a mediocre way rather than doing fewer in a really good way. And I think often times, the Encore department -- Mike get squeezed a little bit in terms of the space that it needs to do it successfully. So we can offer much more breadth of assortment online, and again, that seems to be working well for us.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my second question is about Activewear as a category for both men and women. I mean it's a categories that it seems like a tremendous opportunity, and retailers are clamoring to get into the space and Zella looks amazing. So I just wondered, if you could talk about that as an opportunity, and would you consider Zella or another private label brand for men?","Peter E. Nordstrom","So another really good question. In fact, it has been successful for us, and Zella has been a huge catalyst for that, given that we own that brand and manufacture it and design it ourselves, that's something we're really proud of. And we've not really come close to the full potential of that brand in the Women's area. In terms of how that's going to translate to Men's, we've had those conversations about that line specifically, or there may be another label that we might be able to do in Men's through NPG. But right now, what we're doing is trying to expand on the big athletic brands that we have already. The challenge there is not dissimilar from the Encore conversation where we have to prioritize and edit, make the space that we need to be able to do it well rather than do it in kind of a mediocre way. So the good news for us is we have a lot of stores where we can try different iterations of how we layout Men's, and this is something that we are working on currently and will happen for the remainder of the year as we try to figure out the best go-forward plan.","Operator","Our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I wanted to talk a little bit about fulfillment. As obviously there's more dollars being allocated to fulfillment, how do you see ultimately, with online with the stores, how does the fulfillment equation work? And what do you think of the margin opportunity once you get fulfillment where you want it to be?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Dana, it's Blake. On the fulfillment subject, it's really evolving. And if you go back, it was about in bulk just getting it to our stores. And then with catalog starting, but really the e-commerce business having one large efficient facility, as the customers expectations and really terrific choices have evolved, we're looking at our supply chain from a customer point of view of how do we deliver single items in a much more timely manner. And so that's going to mean -- we've been on this journey, and we've been utilizing our stores' inventory and services better, and we have an opportunity in all aspects of our business -- off price, as well as regular price. But it will require more smaller centers to be able to deal on a more timely way with our customers. And so we will be, over time, making more investments and evolving there, and technology plays a huge role in it, too, because the old days of fulfillment, it was a big cement building and kind of in bulk -- kind of going through that. And now, actually, the technology is ensuring that the allocation is proper to where the customer and the demand is to be able in a timely way get it in their hands. And so you talked about margin lastly. Where the efficiencies occur is that we're able to, again, maximize that inventory and turn it better and flow it better, and through this multichannel strategy then that creates a more higher percentage of regular-price selling, which improves our bottom line. So we're encouraged by that. And we're -- we've made good progress, but there's a lot to do, and we look forward to, in future calls, communicating with all of you about what our plans are there.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes. And Dana, this is Pete. What I would add to that is the challenge that we've had in the last couple of years is trying to catch up with all the demand we've had online. I mean, the most efficient way to allocate inventory is to put it where the demand is coming from. And so I think we've done a much better job in this last quarter of getting the inventory in the right place. But it's all based on having really good information and good flexibility, and this is just an ongoing challenge for us to continue to try to put the inventory where the demand is being generated.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you provide any sense for the magnitude around how trends picked up in April or the weakness for seasonal, or how warmer regions outperformed? Essentially, any metrics that helped give you confidence in the 3% to 5% comp guidance for the rest of the year?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Erika, this is Mike. We're not going to get into that level of detail. But suffice it to say, we did see measurable change in terms of improvement in those regions that we called out, and we have seen a more normalized pattern of selling in the seasonal goods. And our practice has been, as we've said in the past, is that we will replace the actual that we've incurred with the plan that was there, and we'll use the plan the remainder of the year unless there is something materially different. And at this point in time, we don't see anything materially different from that plan.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just a follow-up, how big are your private label brands today?","Michael G. Koppel","How big are the private label brands?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes. What do you exactly mean? Like what...","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","What proportion of sales or...","Peter E. Nordstrom","We don't give that exact information. I would say it's at a fairly similar level as it's been in total, but we have some places where it's really grown quite a bit. And we mentioned Women's in particular, and I think that's just been good for us all the way around. The good news there is that there's a great example to be able to follow, and all our merchants are nothing if not competitive. And they like seeing that example out there and feeling like there's an opportunity for them to expand with private label as well. Most of it is happening along what we would consider the better price points, that's where most of the opportunity is. And we are trying to enhance that, make it bigger and better because we're encouraged by what we've been able to achieve of late.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo.","Tracy Kogan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I was wondering if we can assume, just based on what you said about full-price selling, that your merchandise margin was up in the quarter? And if so, could you give us the magnitude? And then wondering how much the shipping hurts you there. And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit about the new store performance of your recent Rack openings?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Tracy, this is Mike. In terms of merchandise performance, actually, we continue to see somewhat of a downtrend in our total merchandise margin because of the growth of the Rack is becoming a larger percent of total. And Rack, just by its inherent nature, has a lower margin. That being said, the individual businesses relative to their plan and expectations did very well for the quarter, so we were happy with the merchandise margin performance. And then the second question, excuse me, was?","Blake W. Nordstrom","On the Rack, new store performance this quarter. And I made -- this is Blake, I made brief mention on that, Mike, on earlier question. We've been really pleased with our new store performance throughout 2012, and that's continued in 2013 in Q1. And so I think we made mention that we've opened 8 stores to date, and you're going to have 1 or 2 that vary a little bit. But overall, it's been exceeding our plans, and that teams executing those openings well to date.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Exstein from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A quick question, please. Can you just give us a sense about non-seasonal goods, how they did versus seasonal goods?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I think -- well, for example, we had a good coat season, I think that's part of what the same thing. Our coat business for the quarter was up considerably. But most of it, how we trace it, was along the lines of the seasonal goods being spring or summer goods, from T-shirts to shorts to sandals, was measurably down. And that has improved. Again, as everyone has mentioned, as the quarter went on and we feel like we're in a much more normalized place. But that is definitely how we measured it and looked at it.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so just following up, so the businesses that are less seasonal, seasonally impacted, was their rate of sale relatively unchanged throughout the quarter? Or was the lack of seasonal goods really hurting traffic in the front end of the quarter?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes. Maybe the best way to look at that is Cosmetics, which had a good quarter. And so if you were to look at that, you would get the sense that things have really been unchanged for them. And so I think that would speak to what you're talking about, traffic has generally been good, their businesses continue to go at the same momentum it's gone for quite a while. So yes, I think that would probably be a good example to demonstrate what we suggested here.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Wilson from Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Mike, you've mentioned in the past, you've had this higher regular-price metric that you've discussed. I think for many quarters now, yet I'm looking at a gross profit margin that's in decline. So can you help me reconcile the 2?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, there's a couple of things in there outside of the merchandise margin. One is what I just discussed, and that's the growth of the Rack business. The off-price business, the economics of that business has a lower merchandise margin, Rack's becoming a larger percent of the total, so it's bringing the average down. And the second thing, which is something else we've also shared, is the growth of the Fashion Rewards program. The accounting requires that the cost of the benefits get reflected in the gross profit line, and so that's also having an effect. But in terms of the actual merchandise margins and the health of the inventory and our ability to sell things at a regular price, that continues to be a positive.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Can you help me -- can you define regular price? I mean, are you talking about all 3 channels, the Rack, the full price and the Internet?","Michael G. Koppel","We're primarily talking about our full-line stores and our Direct channel, not the Rack.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Tubin from RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you provide us any update on HauteLook, and how that business trended in the quarter? And whether you have anything new going on with that business?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, actually, HauteLook had a very good quarter. Its comps were actually higher than our Direct channel, and for the first time, we had operating profitability. So that business has shown some good legs [ph]. We're making some progress in terms of leveraging our ability to get product and some of the things we've done operationally to improve fulfillment. So we actually made some very good progress in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Jaffe from Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of just housekeeping questions and then a bigger picture issue. The number of square feet at the end of the quarter, is that -- if you could share that with us for modeling purposes?","Michael G. Koppel","I don't have that in front of me, but I'm sure we can get that to you, Richard, off-line.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the Anniversary Sale, given the shift in the fiscal calendar this year, will that be the same year-over-year or apples-to-apples on a quarterly basis?","Michael G. Koppel","No. Actually, it will be different. You may recall last year, the last week of the Anniversary Sale fell into the third quarter. This year, it will all be in the second quarter. So our second quarter sales will be higher as a result of that.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And 3Q might suffer a little bit?","Michael G. Koppel","And 3Q would be down, that's correct.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. And then just a bigger question on the Men's business and what's been a source of success for you, and I'm wondering if you could comment on that and how that's performing, and what's making it work?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. Men's has been a real solid performer for us, and that's been that way for over a year now. And we've had pretty good strength really across the board. In particular, our clothing departments had, with suits, primarily, has been really strong. I think that our Men's team has done a good job of evolving our operative to feel more modern and relevant and give a guy a reason to buy something new, it's -- you've got to keep moving forward and make sure that you're really grounded in what the customers are -- what's motivating the  customer to buy and lifestyles evolve and change. I mean, Jennifer [Black] even spoke to it a little bit in terms of like the Active trend, as an example. I think that our Men's team has done a really nice job of continuing to evolve our offer and be there for our customers.","Operator","And our final question today is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Market.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to get a little bit of color on the credit business, it seems to be continuing to improve, although the credit revenues were lower than last year. So I wondered, Mike, if you could just add a little color there?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, sure. Well, our credit metrics continue to be very strong, and matching and then sometimes better than where they were pre-recession. Our write-offs are in the low 3s, our delinquencies are 1.7 right now, so that's very positive. In terms of the credit revenue, I thought the credit revenue was relatively even with last year.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Is she speaking to reserves, maybe? Taking them or...","Michael G. Koppel","No, I don't think so. So I mean, we haven't seen a significant growth in our receivables because the trend we've seen over several years is improving payment rates. So the efficiency of that asset continues to get better, and so that's why we've seen relatively flat credit revenue year-over-year just because of the growth of the receivables. And by the way, we have a large percentage of our customers who don't revolve.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. So they're paying off as opposed to actually using the credit?","Michael G. Koppel","That's exactly right.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I will now introduce Rob Campbell, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin, sir.","Robert E. Campbell","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and we'll include roughly 30 minutes for your questions.","As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom, Inc.; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's first quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2013. During the Q&A session, we will be joined by Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Stores.","Before we begin, I want to mention that Blake and Mike will be using slides that can be viewed in the Investor Relations section of our website. If you are listening to this conference call as a webcast, you should already see the title slide. If you are listening by telephone, you can view the slides by going to nordstrom.com and the Investor Relations section.","And now, I'll introduce Blake Nordstrom.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. We continually aspire to improve the customer experience across all channels and encompassing new products, new markets and new technology. We're encouraged by the platform we're establishing that will enable us to drive sustainable, profitable growth.","We ended the second quarter with earnings per diluted share of $0.93. This was a credit to the discipline that was demonstrated with respect to inventory and expenses and reflective of the variable nature of our financial model, partially offsetting sales that were softer than anticipated. Overall, our sales trends in the second quarter and throughout the first half of the year weren't as strong as we expected.","Total company same-store sales in the second quarter increased 4.4%. Multichannel same-store sales increased 4.2%, with consistent trends experienced across both regions and merchandise categories. Rack achieved a same-store sales increase of 2.4%, improving upon first quarter's increase of 0.8%. The anniversary sale then generated a low single-digit same-store sales increase, which is below expectations, but consistent with trends. Early Access continues to be a benefit valued by our Fashion Rewards members and the strength of our loyalty program was an important driver of the event.","Next, I'd like to offer an update on our growth strategy, which fundamentally reflects our desire to be the best in service and experience in serving our customers across multiple channels. One of our overarching strategic themes is to increase our relevance with existing and new customers. We are encouraged with the momentum in our Women's Apparel business, driven by improved execution as well as strategic changes that we are making to help attract new customers. It was a notable achievement that Women's Apparel led all merchandise divisions in our Anniversary Sale performance.","The performance of Topshop has been promising. In response, this fall, we will expand it to another 28 full-line stores, bringing the total to 42 stores by year-end. Thus far, in 2013 we've opened 8 Rack stores, bringing the total to 127 and plan to open 14 more this fall. To date, as a group, the newer Racks are achieving results in line with our expectations. Our Rack stores are gaining more experience with the mobile point-of-sale devices that were rolled out last year, allowing us to enhance the customer experience by improving the speed of checkout. Our Direct business grew 37% in the second quarter, as it maintains a focus on improving selection, convenience and the overall customer experience.","During the quarter, we made progress on a number of initiatives, including the following: We further expanded our online merchandise selection. We collaborated with Pinterest, where we have over 4.5 million followers, to highlight top items online and in selected stores. Continued construction of a second fulfillment center in Southern California to be completed in the fall and we are developing plans to add a third fulfillment center on the East Coast in 2015.","Our preparation for expansion into Canada is on track, with the first of our 5 announced full-line store openings to take place in Calgary in the fall of 2014. We think when we're fully established in Canada, with 8 to 10 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Racks, it can be roughly a $1 billion business for us. We've been focused on improving our multichannel capabilities for a number of years, and our belief in its strength to elevate the customer experience only grows stronger over time.","We're working to elevate this experience in-store and online, with both a full-price and off-price offering for each. While each channel represents a meaningful growth opportunity individually, the synergies created by the overall customer experience contribute to our ability to attract, retain and serve customers into the future.","We are encouraged by the opportunities we see, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our ongoing progress.","And now, I'll turn over the call to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. As we reached the halfway point in the year, we are pleased with our progress. We are on track with our long-term plan, including improvements in the online experience, enhancements to our merchandise offering to increase our relevance with existing and new customers and accelerated store openings in the Rack. We remain positive about our path forward and confident in our investments to serve more customers across multiple channels.","Now, I'd like to offer a few comments on our second quarter performance. Earnings per diluted share of $0.93 increased 24% relative to last year. As a reminder, the shift of our Anniversary event resulted in a favorable comparison to last year and is expected to be offset by an unfavorable comparison in the third quarter.","In the second quarter, the impact of the event shift resulted in an increase to same-store sales of approximately 250 basis points and an increase to earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.06.","Though sales were less than anticipated, the second quarter showed moderate improvement from early in the year. We maintained our focus on managing inventory and expenses, while benefiting from the variable nature of our financial model.","The gross profit rate of 35.5%, which was in line with our expectations, decreased by 13 basis points over last year, primarily due to growth in our Fashion Rewards program. We now have 3.6 million active members, up 18% from a year ago. We continue to achieve meaningful growth in both card penetration and sales over last year.","In the first 6 months of the year, we opened over 500,000 new accounts. This is on pace to match the 1 million accounts opened last year, which benefited from enhancements to the program made in January of 2012.","We were disciplined in our merchandise planning, which allowed us to exit the quarter in a favorable inventory position. Ending inventory per square foot grew 2.6% compared to sales per square foot growth of 3.9%.","When removing the impact of the Anniversary event shift, inventory growth outpaced sales growth due to continued planned investments in pack and hold inventory to support Rack's growth.","On the expense side, the SG&A rate decreased 105 basis points. This, in part, reflected leverage from higher sales volume due to the shift in the Anniversary sale. It was also a function of a reduction in variable expenses correlated with top line and overall company performance. Overhead expenses, supporting both current operations and future growth, were on plan.","We incurred expenses in the second quarter related to both Canada and Rack growth of $4 million or $10 million on a year-to-date basis, which is on track with our full-year estimate of $20 million to $25 million.","Now I'd like to provide additional color on our long-term growth. As Blake shared, we strive to be an exemplar in providing a superior customer experience, in stores and online, in full price and off-price and with synergies across channels.","While full-line stores will continue to be the foundation of our business, representing the core of our brand, we believe that over next 5 years, roughly half of our sales could come from the combination of Rack, online and Canada.","The dynamics of our business model anticipate the following: Continued moderate growth in full-line, including new market opportunities in Canada and Manhattan; accelerated Rack store expansion to increase our reach to new customers and in response to customer demand; and aggressive growth online driven by our investments to expand in this channel and our customer base.","Over the last year, we have shared our view of the evolving business model as we continue to grow. We expect to drive value creation through sales and EBIT growth, combined with a more productive capital base.","As we previously discussed, we believe our growth investments will limit operating margin expansion over the next several years. That said, our overarching long-term financial goals remain the same, to achieve high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens return on invested capital.","Now, let's turn our updated -- let's turn to our updated expectations for the year. We have revised our plans to reflect results in the first half of the year, as well as our view of a continuation of current sales trends through the remainder of the year. As a result, we reduced our annual same-store sales outlook to 2% to 3% compared to the prior outlook of 3% to 5%.","Our current outlook of earnings per diluted share is $3.60 to $3.70, relative to the prior outlook of $3.65 to $3.80. Please refer to the Performance Summary document located on our website for more color on our line item guidance.","In closing, our enthusiasm about our investments and the many opportunities in front of us remains strong. We are confident in our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy, as we deliver a differentiated customer experience in-store and online.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. I should have mentioned earlier that also joining us for Q&A is Jamie Nordstrom, President of Direct. [Operator Instructions]","For now, let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And if you look at the quarter and the performance, can you just talk about how things progressed during the month and -- by month? And also, if you look at the Rack business versus full-line, if you could compare and contrast that as well.","Michael G. Koppel","Well, Deborah, this is Mike. I think on one of the charts that we provided, we illustrated the cadence of sales by month for the quarter. And I think the story was after a softer first 2 months earlier in the year, our overall sales trends were pretty consistent in the last 4 months of the first half of the year. So I wouldn't go any deeper than that because I think the overall consistency is reflective of that.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of your Fashion Rewards customers, do they continue to outperform the rest of your customers as well?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, they do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Market.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about Anniversary and how the cadence of the sale has changed with the emphasis on Fashion Rewards and just the greater flexibilities, given to customers to shop online, et cetera, with Early Access? Just comparing to the last few years, how have things changed?","Erik B. Nordstrom","This is Erik. There is -- has been some shift in the cadence over the last couple of years. Our Fashion Reward program continues to be a tremendous strength for our overall business. And it's -- there's 2 big impacts around Anniversary. It's -- the Direct is with Fashion Reward customers participating in Early Access and that's grown healthily over the last couple of years. The other big impact of that though is, by having that Early Access as part of the Fashion Rewards program, we opened up a lot of accounts, especially around Anniversary. And the benefits of Fashion Reward customer serve us all through the year. So it's been a real win-win for the company and I think for our customers. And you mentioned some of the shift to online. And I think that's just another example. Customers -- they want to shop how they want to shop. Our job isn't to dictate how they want to shop. Our job is to serve them as best as we possibly can. And we've had a number of years, where we've had strong mobile channel capabilities. And we find that during sale time, in particular, customers like to use online, both to shop directly and our percentage of our business goes up online during sale events, but they also like using the web as a tool for their store shopping. So that synergy that we've experienced good value for a number of years on heightens during Anniversary.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one follow-up, in terms of Anniversary, you mentioned that you're pleased with the progress in Women's Apparel. What about the other parts of the Women's business? Are you seeing some kind of trade-off between Apparel versus Accessories? Or did you feel like those other categories kind of continued to carry their weight?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I'd say they pretty much continue to carry their weight. We had actually a fairly level of performance, I mean some did better than others but not dramatically. The place where we're probably must challenged related to Women's Apparels in the Juniors segment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Okay. Our next call actually comes from Jennifer Black with Jennifer Black and Associates.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","I know you were just talking about some of the categories. I wondered if you could give us a deeper view into what categories performed well and what categories underperformed. And I'm just curious about the strength in Men's and then also I'm really curious about Women's individual departments.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Jennifer, this is Pete. Without getting into too much detail, Women's across the board actually did fairly well. Individuals has been strong. Our coat business has been strong. We've had good Studio and Narrative business kind of through this year so far. And that's been carried through with the event. For sure, our efforts around Savvy and Topshop, in particular, have helped drive new customers into Women's. If you look at the total lift that we're getting in Women's, a big part of that is how we've just kind of shifted our center of gravity and put more energy and investment of inventory in those classifications. That's worked out pretty darn well. Men's has really performed quite well with Men's clothing. Kind of interestingly, if you look out over a period of time, has really been on a good trajectory there. Really solid business for us. We've executed really well there. And the team deserves a lot of credit. As I mentioned, the challenging part is really BP. Our Women's Juniors has been the most challenging. And I think we own a lot of that. We've traditionally done a pretty good job of -- doing a good job with items there. And for whatever reason, we didn't hit it as well this season as we have before. The good news is that department turns relatively quickly. We can learn things fast and we have a chance to make adjustments. So we're working on it, We think we can improve it.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","Great. I just -- I have one follow-up. I wondered what your thoughts were on the duration of the sale, as far as how long it's open to the public.","Peter E. Nordstrom","That's a good question. We talk about that a lot. It's a weighted decision because we do so much business on all those days. Even the worst Anniversary sale day is significantly better than a non-sale day on the terms of just pure volume. So we need to be careful about making those kind of decisions. Obviously, Early Access has impacted that. I don't know, if we look at the balance of the wholesale, we did more business on this Anniversary Sale than we've ever done in the history of the company. So I think, if you look at it from that point of view, it's been successful. There's a lot of risk, obviously, with the inventory investments we need to make. And it's a lot of pressure and strain on the people and stores to execute it because it's a high level that's taken to do it. So I don't -- all this stuff goes into question for us. We balance the historical stuff that we have with our new strategies that we're trying to implement. And as Erik mentioned, the way Early Access and online have impacted the sale, but we have to be mindful what that means and how it might impact how we execute the sale in the future. But those are the things that we're actually working on right now while the results are still fresh in our mind. And we'll probably have a much better idea about a month or so from now exactly how we'll amend it next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So I'm just wondering if you guys could speak to your expanded merchandise selection online. Obviously, the Direct business being up 37%, nice uptick on a 2-year. Could you amplify on that for us?","James F. Nordstrom","Yes, Charles, this is Jamie. We started about 2 years ago to do some pretty simple things with selection. Number one was make sure that all the merchandise we were buying for any of our stores we were also putting online, which had not been our strategy prior to that. We had -- we had curated an assortment for our website, much like we would do that for a store. And so roughly 2 years ago, we said no, if we're going to carry an item in any store, we should also have it on our website. So that's been the bulk of our selection expansion efforts. And then more recently, this year, we've gone beyond what we carry in the stores. And it's not anything radical or something that would stick out, but it's brands and styles that we may not be able to physically fit in a store, but are super relevant to our customers. So an example would be a great brand like Burberry. We may have 50 styles of Burberry in one of our stores, but they make 400 styles for the season. And we can carry all that on our website and there's a lot of demand for that. So that's a flavor of what we're focused on right now.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one for Mike, on Slide 13, the EBIT margin expectations, I was wondering if you could just walk through the -- how big a GAAP there is between the 3 segments, in terms of the actual operating margin percentages? And then, did I hear you correctly in that, as you kind of think about the next 5 years, with a high single digit sales growth, that we should expect essentially no margin expansion in the retail business, essentially staying pretty flat. Is that sort of the message you guys are trying to get across?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, Charles, we're not breaking out to that level of specificity in terms of the percentage differences. But I think directionally, those slides give a pretty good story, in terms of the overall fundamental ability for those businesses to drive margin. And then, in terms of the overall, in the aggregate, yes, our message is for the next several years, we don't expect overall company margin expansions.","Operator","Next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you comment on any geographical areas of strength during the quarter, and also any commentary that you have on early fall selling post the sale?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Okay, this is Erik. Geography, pretty darn consistent. For a while, our Southern parts -- both our Southeast and Southwest regions have done well, as well as the Midwest. Nothing really stands out unusually either and for our regions. Now what was the second question?","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Early fall selling trends?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Oh, early fall. Do you have anything...","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, we had some really good performances in what would be kind of typically fall type of classifications things like boots, for example. I think the number one item we had in terms of pure dollars was a boot. So that -- I think that bodes well for what we think is going to happen in the fall. Our coat business has been pretty strong and that's continued on. So I -- we -- as the sale has progressed over the years, there's a bit more of a buy now, wear now thing happening, but we still have customers that are really interested in what's new, particularly as it relates fall. And so we get some good indications. And I think for the most part, we feel like we're pretty spot on there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you maybe talk about the expense reductions that were made intra-quarter to respond to the slower sales environment. If you could kind of bucket those out for us. And also wonder if you adjusted bonuses during the quarter, if you maybe reversed an accrual?","Michael G. Koppel","Paul, this is Mike. I think as we've shared in the past, roughly 40% of our operating model is variable. And what primarily drives that is the commission-based sales structure in the full line stores, as well as the fulfillment costs for anything that we ship to customers. And when our sales are down relative to our plan, those naturally adjust to that. And so one piece of it is just the variable nature of the model. And the second piece, which you brought up in terms of incentives, yes, we did make some adjustments in the second quarter based on overall reduction in our expectations for the year.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you quantify those for us, Mike?","Michael G. Koppel","No, I think at this time, we're not going to quantify the details of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just I think -- I forget if it was the prepared remarks, but I think your -- you said you had some expense in Canada and I know you're targeting next year for the first opening. What -- can you give us just color on what's really different up there, maybe on both the investment side, but also the operational and the merchandise side? What do you expect to be different, what do you think the challenges are and how do you think you'll address them?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Paul, this is Mike. Well, let me just start with this year and then I think Erik will talk a little bit about some of the operating challenges going forward. The biggest difference right now is to open stores in a different country is going to require a different technology support and different functionality in terms of how we operate the business. And that's probably the most significant upfront difference. And then of course, we have to make early on investments to build our team and to get some of the merchandising and buying processes in place. So those are the things that we're experiencing right now, up to and prior to the opening of the store. And then with the opening, I'll turn that over to Erik.","Erik B. Nordstrom","Yes, as Mike touched on, there's a tremendous challenge just operationally. Pretty much every business function needs some change to operate in another country, which probably isn't big news, but we haven't done that before. So there's a lot of work for us. But in the end, we will be successful if we deliver a great experience for our customers. And as we talk to customers more and more, and that's what we're doing a lot of, we're doing a lot of listening, what we hear more than any other thing is bring us a great Nordstrom store, don't bring us Nordstrom light. And that's what we're focused on. So it's not a different strategy, how we execute it, it's going to have to be different some of the systems and logistics and things. But we're focused on making those stores the absolute best Nordstrom stores they can be. And we are confident that if we do that, that will be successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Jamie, I was wondering if you can speak a little bit to the mobile strategies, what you guys are working on here near term. And I think there was some discussion at some point, maybe the last 2 calls, about your launching a tender-agnostic loyalty program. I'm just wondering where you guys are in that process and if we could see some hints of that this fall?","James F. Nordstrom","Neely, we continue to see an increase in the amount of customers that are engaging with our website through mobile devices. It's outpacing just the overall growth, which I think is -- and something that's happening in history [ph]. So we've been focused on making sure that our mobile optimized website, as well as our apps, are meeting customers' expectations. So we've recently relaunched an upgraded version of our iPhone app. We've added some features to that, and customers are responding pretty favorably. We do believe that, that's going to keep going for a while. We think the amount of customers that want to engage with us through their phone has a lot of runway left. And so we're putting a lot of effort in making sure that the experience they get when they interact with us through their phone is a pretty good one. I'll let Mike handle the loyalty part.","Michael G. Koppel","Neely, in terms of the non-tender loyalty, I think we've shared with everybody previously that we did a test in our cosmetics area last fall. And we're currently in progress in terms of building an infrastructure that's going to allow us to test a broader base, non-tender program. And we should be able to start that testing sometime in the near future, we don't have an exact date, but we're working toward a test in the near future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I know historically, when you've had Anniversary Sales that have been slightly weaker than planned, you've had to kind of run some of that excess inventory, either through full-line or at Rack. And I know while you're pleased with the aggregate amount of inventory, I guess if you could comment specifically on Anniversary Sale inventory and your comfort level with it.","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. We actually -- we did a pretty good job in our sell-throughs and we met our plan in all those cases and exceeded last year. Where we have a tougher time is if it's some of the product is NPG product, where we own it, we made it. And in those cases, I think we have to really think about how we're going to be able to mark it down an efficient way and work through it. But there's a lot of upfront plans that we work on with our vendors that enables us to swap out product, or in some cases they take it back, or what have you. There's -- it's just really a product of working with our best vendors that we have the best partnerships with to do a collaborative thing here to the mutual benefit of everybody. And so we found that the mutual participation and partnership has been great. So we're actually in good shape there. I think, again, that the challenge will be in just a very couple of isolated places we have, some of our own products that we're going to have to work through here in early fall.","Michael G. Koppel","Ed, I would also add that we've considered any pockets that we might think a risk in our going forward expectations for the year. And I will also say that those pockets are pretty small.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. I notice you also left the credit revenue forecast unchanged. I guess how should we think about that line longer term? I know you're getting, obviously, continued strength within Fashion Rewards. Your trends there, I think, are well ahead of that guidance so you've put up year-to-date. And with interest rates rising, could that be a potential upside source longer-term?","Michael G. Koppel","Ed, as you know, we don't look at that line as a, I would say, explicit growth line in terms of driving revenue. It's an outcome of what we believe is a very good credit offering. That being said, the growth in the receivables is up a little bit. That's naturally going to grow a little bit of that revenue. There is a portion of our accounts that have variable-based pricing based on interest rates. And if in the future, we should see rising interest rates, that there would be some impact from that. But keep in mind that well over half of our accounts are transactors. They pay off monthly and we don't earn any finance revenue on those. So I wouldn't necessarily look at that as a standout explicit driver.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if you think about -- step back and just look at the Anniversary sale, think about what we've -- how you guys have talked about over the past few years and you've expanded Early Access and it seems like you're -- I don't feel like you got to the headline number you wanted to on the sale with the low single-digit number this year. Maybe you can talk about the components of that growth rate? And maybe was it a volume issue after years of such heavy volume for that sale? Or do you think maybe you need to tweak pricing or anything like that.","Erik B. Nordstrom","This is Erik. Really -- the story is our trend Anniversary is very consistent with our trend all year long. Were our expectations higher? Yes. Our sales year-to-date are below our expectations going through the year. But our volume results during the Anniversary Sale were very much in line with our year-to-date trend.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick follow up. Maybe -- obviously, you did a really good job of balancing the retail SG&A dollars and the sales environment in the quarter. Is there a similar ability to flex that in the back half of the year if the sales environment doesn't play out to the guidance?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, this is Mike. Certainly, anything related to the volume -- the top line volume that's either driven in the stores or driven through fulfillment in the stores or fulfillment through our Direct business is going to have an impact on our variable costs. So the answer is yes to that. In terms of the management incentives, likely, the impact of that wouldn't be as meaningful as it was in the first half of the year just because in the second quarter, there was little bit of a catch up for a six-month adjustment. But that being said, we continue to operate the model consistently and do expect that if our performance is good, it will cost us more to do that business. If it's less, it will cost us less.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, I'm hoping that you can help us with the small trim in the earnings sides for the year. If you could just help us understand, what piece of that, or is it equal parts of both, came from the slight shortfall in the first half and how much is it a revised outlook for the second half of the year?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Kimberly. Most that -- I would say entirety, if you look at the results for the year, it's all about the drop in the comp sales. We originally went into the year with a 3% to 5% expectation. We dropped it to 2% to 3%. We made the appropriate adjustments in volume and margin, and then the appropriate adjustments in the SG&A. And that's really what's driving it. There's no other story outside of that other than volume.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And would you say the lower revenue expectations or the lower comp expectations are sort of equally in the first half and the second half? Or is there something about the trend that you've seen in the business recently that's giving you a little bit more pause for the second half of the year?","Michael G. Koppel","I would say at this point in time, the trend we're looking at the back half of the year is pretty consistent with what we saw in the first half. And that's how -- and that's what's reflected in the numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just going -- digging a little deeper on your back half guidance, it looks like there may have been a slight change to the fourth quarter comp guidance embedded in that. And could you just talk about maybe the third quarter versus the fourth quarter and if there are any calendar shifts that you're looking at in particular that might have changed that?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. In terms of any shifts, the biggest difference is the fact that we expect the third quarter to be down because of the movement of the Anniversary Sale. Last year, 1 week of the A Sale was in the third quarter. This year, it all fell in the second quarter. So relative to the expectations for the back half of the year, the third quarter is expected to be below what the overall average is and the fourth quarter roughly the same. And because of the large amount of volume in the fourth quarter, it tends to carry the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just taking a step back and thinking about the bigger picture, your sales have certainly slowed down quite a bit this year versus years past. And you're not the only retailer to experience that. What do you think is the mindset of your customer today? Are they feeling challenged? Is it just a lack of want for apparel and accessory, the lack of newness in the fashion in the stores? Just be interested in your take on that.","Michael G. Koppel","Paul, this is Mike. I think if you step back even further than the period of time that you suggested, we're in a business that tends to travel in cycles. And we did -- we have had a very strong last 3 years coming off the recession. We're up against 3 very strong stack years. We think that's a piece of it. There's been all kinds of stories out there in terms of all the different macro factors that may be affecting consumer spending. We think there's probably a story in every one of those thoughts. But in the end, our job is to stay focused and execute on what's given us, and that's what we're doing. We feel very good about the future. And we think that this is just one of those shorter-term blitz within a long cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to dig into that last question a little bit. Is there any category that you've seen take a sort of sharper drop-off than others? I'm specifically interested in Women's Shoes, Jewelry, Watches, Cosmetics, how are those performing relative to the very strong trend that we've seen for several years.","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. There's nothing to indicate a drop-off in our business, as it correlates to some kind of macro trend. And usually that's applied to like a designer agenda or something. We've had really continued good strong growth in all the luxury and designer parts of our business. I mean, as I've mentioned a couple of times already, the most challenging part of our business has been Women's Juniors, but that's not related necessarily to any kind of macro factor that we're aware of. It's probably a lot to do with just how we execute. So yes, the shoe thing has still gone well for us. Some of the changes that we had in Shoes is reflected upon specific items, for example, that we've grown into very, very large items over the last couple of years. And when those change at all, then we feel that, but this is not -- it's not unusual. I think Mike talked about it a little bit. This is kind of a normal cycle of how the business goes and we've been through these cycles before and we just keep moving on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Two little quick questions. If you could do over the quarter, what would you do differently, merchandising, sales, anything else? And then could you just update us on HauteLook?","Blake W. Nordstrom","That's a good question. If we could do anything over, what would we do differently? I think part of it is we have an ongoing challenge with figuring out how to work both the retention and the acquisition side of how we're reaching out to customers. And I think an ongoing issue for us is to find the appropriate balance there. I think as it relates to Anniversary sale, really anything I think if we can figure out how to invest in a way that acquires new customers, then I think that's something we would do. We have thoughts on that and we're applying it to everything we're doing going forward. But I guess in terms of the benefit of hindsight, that would probably be something that we would look to change maybe a little bit. And in HauteLook?","James F. Nordstrom","This is Jamie. Our HauteLook business is really good and give credit to that team down there in L.A. They're firing on all cylinders and are well ahead of plan for the year. And I think the net effect of that is it gives us a lot of confidence in the future and opportunity in that online off-price space. We think that there is a really compelling customer opportunity there for us. And the team at HauteLook is building a platform for us that's going to give us a lot of growth in the future, so we're pretty excited about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe just starting up with the follow-up on the questions regarding sales outlook and the consumer mindset, anything you'd highlight in terms of trends by price points, just strength and either the high end or the low end within the assortment?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, it's Pete. As I said before, it's nearly impossible to draw any kind of correlation between that. Whatever ups and downs we have in the business right now isn't necessarily related to a specific price point like that.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And Then shifting gears on Rack, as the Rack expansion has continued, any changes to your expectations on the sales ramp and profitability? And then specifically, as that concept heats up, are you finding the sites that you want? And has the cost equation shifted at all from a real estate perspective?","Blake W. Nordstrom","This is Blake. On those questions to the Rack, it's meeting our expectations and we haven't seen any change in terms of real estate, availability or costs or a number of the factors that you mentioned changing from what we've been experiencing last year or 2 or 3. So we're encouraged by the customer response to that business and the opportunities going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering about the integration of HauteLook for full-line stores and the Rack businesses. I'm wondering how those are coming along and if there's developments we can look for in the near future in terms of shopping, returning and mixing of brands.","James F. Nordstrom","Richard, this is Jamie. Yes, we do have plans. I would say we are in the very early stages of some of those integration plans. Since the acquisition, we've tried to not hinder HauteLook's growth by trying to do too much integration, but we're getting to the point now where we're going to be able to start doing and talking about some things that we're doing to enable the HauteLook customer to participate more fully in the multi-channel experience with our full-line stores and our Rack stores. And nothing to really get in to details about today, but we'll have more to talk about, I think, over the next 6 to 12 months on that front.","Operator","I'd like to turn over for closing remarks to the speakers.","Robert E.

Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom; and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had a 1% comp increase, as we anticipated, which was consistent with our third quarter's increase of 0.9%.","As we look ahead to 2016, we have always considered 2015 to be a peak investment year. That hasn't changed. What has changed is the current environment that we are facing which requires us to pivot even more as we remain focused on improving profitability. In response, we are making adjustments to reduce expense and capital spending in 2016 and in the coming years.","For 2015, total sales in our full-price business, inclusive of Canada and Trunk Club, increased 5%. In off-price, inclusive of Rack stores and nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, sales increased 14%.","From a merchandising perspective, we're always pursuing newness in fashion to increase our relevance with customers. For example, we continued our success with brands like Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. These brand partnerships have contributed to the strength of our contemporary department and attracted new customers to Nordstrom.","Additionally, we had continued momentum in Beauty, which has been among our top performing categories for the fourth straight year.","Going forward, it is even more important for us to remain focused on the customer as our business continues to evolve. We've made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as to grow our business through new markets. With over $3 billion invested in capital over the last five years, we grew our top line by 50%, which was nearly $5 billion. We're also mindful of the importance for these investments to flow through to the bottom line.","While we're on track with our $20 billion sales ambition by 2020, our efforts to serve customers in multiple channels are having an impact to our business model. In response to changes in our business and current conditions, we've started to implement a number of opportunities to improve profitability.","From a CapEx perspective, we reduced our plan by $300 million over the next five years. From an earnings perspective, our expenses have grown faster than sales to support our multichannel growth. We are taking action to moderate our expense growth over the next several years. Specific to 2016, we have planned expense savings of $100 million relative to our plans a year ago. This equates to a reduction of $50 million relative to 2015. We are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability this year and in the years to come. We view this as fluid and iterative process as we stay focused on the customer and proactively ensure resources are aligned with customer expectations.","I'll now turn it over to Mike, who will provide more details on these changes with respect to our financial outlook.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Blake. First, I'd like to comment on our current results. We finished the year with our results in line with our expectations. Clearly this was a difficult period with industry sales declines and increased promotional activity resulting in compressed merchandise margins. As stated last quarter, we responded quickly and decisively to these trends with respect to inventory levels. While we believe our inventory is current, we continue to monitor trends and make the appropriate adjustments to assure we remain price competitive and have the best product available for our customers.","On the expense side, overall operations were well-managed, resulting in an improved SG&A rate for the fourth quarter relative to our expectations.","Now, I'd like to provide perspective on how we see our business evolving given current business conditions, our investment cycle and commitment to delivering top quartile shareholder returns.","In evolving with our customers, we made significant investments to enable customers to shop in multiple ways. This has resulted in market share gains, but also structural changes to our operating costs. For example, e-commerce now represents over 20% of our sales, a notable increase from 8% five years ago. This business model has a high variable cost structure driven by fulfillment and marketing costs in addition to ongoing technology investments. With our increased investments to gain market share along with the changing business model, expenses in recent years have grown faster than sales.","As Blake mentioned, we are pursuing the following opportunities with focused efforts on increasing efficiency and lowering costs.","In technology, we are planning productivity improvements by focusing on fewer, more meaningful projects, such as a scalable merchandising solution that supports seamless integration across multiple channels. In addition, we are accelerating our efforts to re-platform our architecture to streamline development while reducing costs. In fulfillment, we are assessing ways to improve efficiencies around delivering product to customers which is expected to generate lower shipping costs. We are also refining our online assortments with a focus on unit profitability.","In marketing, we are focusing on improving our effectiveness across all channels. Consistent with our fulfillment efforts, we are measuring enterprise profitability of our total marketing spend.","These and other initiatives are multi-year in nature. While we have successfully gained market share, we are also committed to growing profitability. With our investments moderating, we view 2016 as an inflection point of earnings growth improvement. We are focused on reshaping our business model and continuing that effort over the next several years to achieve our previously stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. As part of our regular communications, we'll keep you posted on our progress.","Moving to our capital investments, our five-year CapEx plan of $4 billion or 5% of sales represents a $300 million reduction in store investments relative to last year's plan. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be roughly $900 million, with one-third allocated to Canada and Manhattan. Technology and fulfillment, which represents another third is planned flat to last year, a considerable reduction from a 35% annualized growth over the last five years.","Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club are beginning to pay off with over $400 million added to our top line growth in 2015. The dilutive impact of these growth initiatives has peaked in 2015, with expected EBIT improvement beginning in 2016. In addition, our loyalty program is an enabler of growth to help increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. With Rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender-neutral offer in the second quarter.","Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2016 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.10 to $3.35 assumes total sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5% and comps of flat to a 2% increase. Based on current trends, we remain cautious and have considered the impact of a continued promotional environment. In the first half of the year, EPS is planned to decrease by roughly 30% due to the following: the impact of the sale of credit receivables; the impact of growth initiatives, including our third fulfillment center, which opened last August and new store preopening costs; and the shift of our Anniversary event, which will span the second quarter and third quarters in 2016.","In terms of our Credit business, while we expect an initial reduction in EBIT from our revenue-sharing program with TD, we anticipate meaningful opportunities to increase earnings over time. Excluding the impact of the Credit business, we expect improvement in retail EBIT growth driven by the maturing of our growth investments and the operational improvements previously mentioned.","In closing, we continue to believe that we have the right strategies in place to profitably grow our business and successfully serve our current and future customers the Nordstrom way.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We will now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on inventory, any areas of concern versus your plan coming out of the quarter? And can you elaborate on some of the actions that you talked about to remain price competitive? Just really help us to think about gross margin in 2016 versus the 92 basis points of contraction we saw this year?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Matt. This is Mike. I'll take the first part of the question as it relates to where we are relative to plan. We actually transitioned out of the fourth quarter under our original plan inventories. And a matter of fact, the change from plan to actual at the end was consistent with the drop in sales relative to plan. So we felt like we would \u2013 responded inappropriately to keep those inventories in line. Now clearly, it still is a little tenuous out there and we're keeping a very close eye on it, but the aging is in a good place and the levels relative to the investments we're making in our growth initiatives are in the right place as well.","In terms of pricing, I'll let Pete take that.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yes, I guess what I'd say that for us, the promotional and clearance activity drive some sales but not enough to make up for the reduced AUR, so that's where we had a lot of compression, and then also what it does to our margins. So it's not a good situation for us. I mean, there may be other retailers that really benefit from a lot of promotional activity that drive sales in disproportionate ways. So we spend a lot of time trying to be transparent and collaborating with vendors, talking about our desire to have newness really be the component that drives our sales and not the promotional activity. I think we work to identify vendors that operate cleaner businesses. It's a difficult balancing act because you want to make sure that you're bringing things that customers want too. I mean, have things just uniquely or exclusive for exclusive's sake. That doesn't work either.","There are some areas that help mitigate some of the pressure. For example, our own label product, what we call Nordstrom Product Group, it's a growing part of our business. We had a really good year with Nordstrom Product Group and I think that's a way we control our own destiny a little bit more as we go forward. And then I guess lastly, what I would say is, ultimately, our ability to keep our inventories in line with the sales trends is going to be the biggest factor in terms of managing markdowns. And while we've missed sales plans a little bit in the last couple of months, we're in pretty decent shape and we're going to be disciplined this year about keeping those inventories down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Hi. Thank you. I had a question about your earlier comment regarding profitability and fluidity. I was just curious about what you meant in terms of contextualizing, what's your meaning there? And if that's a little bit different from prior thoughts on managing that balance? And on the promotional front, could you just inform us by banner in terms of merchandise margin prospects as you think about Rack, versus full-line, versus online and how the merchandise margins may look this year? You've kind of been a leader in trying to rationalize the promotional environment. So are there any distinctions we should know about on a year-over-year basis in terms of the sales that you'll be running versus last year? Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Oliver, first, this is Mike. I just want to clarify your question on profitability versus fluidity. Were you referring to inventory?","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Just the context of earlier comments on that and I think it's a bigger picture question in terms of how the customer could be changing. But it's related to inventory, as well, potentially.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Well, I think maybe Pete could talk a little bit about the promotional, what we're doing from a promotional standpoint then.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yes, I think the rhythm of the business is the same in that there's a cycle to regular price selling that we pretty much are in lockstep with the industry based on those rhythm. When business is bad, it accelerates that clearance part of it, but the part that we're talking about is promotional activity, where a retailer will take everything that they have to offer, something that's a week old in the inventory and something that's eight weeks old in the inventory and mark everything down. And that's what really erodes the margins.","For us, we don't generate any of those events ourselves, but we have to be competitive for price. So if it's a price that's available for the customer and for all customers, to maintain integrity and trust and confidence of our customers, we're going to match that price. So that's what puts the pressure on us in terms of our promotional activity. We don't have any more promotional activity in terms of clearance days or events, no more plan than ever, actually, I think we're probably tightening that up even a little bit from this last year. So I'm not sure if that answered your question, but philosophically not much has changed in terms of what we've been doing for the last several years.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Yes, that helps. I think it has to do with the dynamicism in terms of the competitive landscape and matching. And were there any clues in terms of the merch margins going forward by banner? Did you feel like certain banners had more opportunities for improvement than others?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yes, it definitely is a matching thing, to your point, certain banners, how that changes. You're talking relative to the Rack business versus the full-price business?","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Yes, yes.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","I don't think there's anything fundamentally different than what we've been dealing with really for years. We've been able to improve our margins mostly through increasing turn, leveraging inventory across multiple channels, just being as efficient as we can, that, again, ultimately over the long haul our ability to keep inventories in line is what's going to make the biggest impact on margin.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oliver, we have historically and really up until the more recent softness in the customer cycle, have always had high and increasing regular price business. And when you go through these soft cycles, when the industry has too much inventory, and there's competitive pricing, that's where we're feeling the biggest pinch, and so, keep being very rigorous about controlling those inventories and about ensuring that we come out of this as we have come out of this before in a good place, we'll assure that future profits will be better.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Thank you very much. Best regards.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Neely Tamminga of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon. So on the current trends commentary; this is for Mike and Pete. Could you give us a little bit more as it relates to that? I mean I guess what we're seeing in stores seems to be a paucity of newness, particularly in designer and resort. So is there a product execution error do you think going on a little bit in terms of just lacking some of that newness, not having quite that risk going up the risk curve? Or is there something else you think related to the consumer related to that Rack versus full-line with any sort of insights you have between those two banners so far this year would be helpful. Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yes, I'm not sure I exactly understand the question. Can you just restate that for me because I didn't catch the beginning of what you were asking there?","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","So, really about current trends, is it ultimately \u2013 is it really consumer led or is it about product missed opportunities? From our own store checks, so we feel like you're lacking maybe a little bit in designer as well as in resort, it just feels like it was a little bit weaker this year versus last year. And I guess what we're trying to figure out is, is this something that can pick up as product newness actually evolves at full-line or is there a consumer issue? And could you comment a little bit more on that issue related to Rack versus full-line type trends? Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Well, the product issue is, and actually we were just discussing that as we were flying back from New York Fashion Week today. It's one of the nice things about our industry. There's always this internal optimism about new things coming out there and people excited to get it in front of customers. And there's evidence all through our business of pockets where business is really good because there's new things that have come in and done well. I mean your comment about designer being off, that's actually not true for us. I mean, our designer shoe and handbag business has been pretty good even through some fairly challenging times. Apparel has had a little bit of pressure but it's just there's \u2013 I think there's a lot of things for us to be excited about and that translates I think to excitement for customers.","So I think that's an excuse you won't find us using. It's a continuous matter of us trying to keep the focus on new product flowing in here. It is going to ebb and flow a little bit but as long as we can keep our inventories in line, I don't think it's going to be a big problem. The Rack on the other hand, they benefit in a lot of ways from some tough business out there because it means there's an excess of potentially really good product that we could get at great prices and because we've got these great relationships with vendors. We can pass the savings along to customers. So I think that the difficult part is when you take \u2013 when retailers or vendors take a price promotion on everything that they sell, they lessen the desirability of a product because why pay full price for it.","And I think that's kind of the insidious part of what happens here and maybe it doesn't lead to good long-term decisions for a health of a brand or even a trend. So that's something that we can't entirely control but obviously we talk to the vendors a lot about and I think one of the advantages that Nordstrom has people recognize out there, vendors recognize out there that we do run a good full-price business. It does motivate our customers and I think ultimately they like doing business with us because of that.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. Thank you, Neely.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. I was just hoping to...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Lorraine.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. I was just hoping to get a little more information on the cost cuts. I believe you said $50 million incremental for 2016. What were you able to do so quickly? And then where do you see the opportunity for maybe the rest of this year but also for 2017 and 2018 in terms of trimming operating expenses?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Lorraine, yes. This is Mike. In terms of that, I think that winds up very well to the three areas that we discussed in the overall approach to the changes in our business model and that's in the areas of technology, supply chain and marketing. And I'm not going to get into a lot of detail there, but suffice it to say, over the last several years, we've clearly been investing aggressively to grow our business. We've grown our business successfully. It's a new channel that is being built out that is still in the relatively early stages of its process and I think we've reached an inflection point where after growing it to the level we have that we're spending a little bit more time focused on then how to turn a lot of that growth into some more profit.","And I would say that that is the common theme that you're going to hear from us as we talk about reductions without getting into anything overly specific. But clearly, we're seeing a, what has been a very noticeable change in our business model. I think one of our slides indicated by the end of this decade that we're going to have a large proportion of our business about 30% being done online. That's all the way from 5% that it was back in 2005 and that is a model that behaves enormously different than the mall-based model.","And so we have a lot to learn about that and we have to keep our lens on as it relates to how the customer sees us and how the customer wants to be served, but at the same time, we have to do it effectively. And so that would be the theme and that will be the theme that we'll be sharing with you as we go forward.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Joan Payson of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about the Nordstrom Rack stores? Comps have been negative now through most of the year. Maybe talk a little bit about what you think that reflects, whether it's online cannibalization or competitive pressures, and does it create any concern around the target for 300 stores longer-term?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Blake, you want to take that, please?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Sure. Joan, this is Blake. The Rack brick-and-mortar part of the comp improved as the quarter \u2013 the fourth quarter went on and the year went on, but no question, the first half \u2013 or the first three quarters of the year they were obviously running below our plans.","And we shared with you both the full-price and off-price multi-channel numbers, and that's something we've been talking about at least from a full-price point of view for a couple of years because most importantly, that's how the customer views the business and that's how the customer shops. So we're trying to be clear about what that store business is and what the online off-price business is as well, but we really look at it as an off-price multi-channel business.","And so for the year in the multi-channel, I mentioned that was up 14%. From a comp point of view, that's 4.3% for the quarter. Multi-channel off-price was up 12%, and comp was up 3.6%. So when we look at it in that regard, we're definitely gaining market share from our competitors.","The new Rack growth, which was the second part of your question, continues to be highly productive stores with terrific returns for our shareholders' investment, and so we feel good about at this juncture that 300 store commitment roughly that we've talked about by the year 2020. Those lead times are short, so we can react to that quickly. We have 24 stores I believe slated to open in 2016, and again, we feel good about the off-price part of our business and the full-price part of it, and so we think there's a good balance between the full-price and off-price and we're continuing with that Rack growth.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ed.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","The decision to moderate the increases in tech spending, do you think that it will over time reduce the level of growth in the online business, or are you able to kind of drive, in your opinion at this stage, similar growth by making more targeted investments? And I guess the follow-up to that is how would you kind of ascertain the return on some of these stepped-up investments over the past couple of years? Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Ed, this is Mike. In terms of moderate the investment, I would just give you a little context that over the last five years, that investment pool has grown at an average of 35% a year, and it's up to about $260 million, $270 million in terms of capital investment.","So we've made a really, really big commitment there. And I think part of what we've learned along that journey is that we could likely be more productive with that capital. And we highlighted a couple things that we believe long-term are going to generate a lot of value. One is having a scalable inventory management tool that can support us well past $20 billion and can support multi-channel. And the second is to re-architect how we think about our technology so as we want to add new features and new applications, we can do it very efficiently and cost-effectively. And we think over the long run, that's going to have big payback.","In terms of the returns of the past, we've had some projects that have delivered some great returns and some that haven't. That, by the way, is part of the business. It's a test and learn and iterate business. But that being said, as I think over the last several years, we've learned that we can likely do it better. And at this point, we don't feel that the moderation in investment is going to limit our growth in that channel.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about inventory. Mike, I think you indicated that the 12% increase in inventory at the end of the quarter was below your original plan. I'm wondering, is there an opportunity to further reduce the inventory growth in 2016? I think you've guided to sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5%, and is there any possibility you might be able to get the inventory growth down into the range of the sales growth? Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the answer is, yes. We think we can continue to improve our inventory turns and make our inventory more efficient. At this point, getting it all the way down to the sales growth may be not practical because we still have a number of forward-looking investments that we need to make. We have store openings, we still have a pretty rapidly growing e-commerce business. And so you have to assure that you've got the right inventory levels to support that future growth. But that said, we do believe there's opportunities to be more efficient.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just going back to the idea of newness in the stores, it seems like you have been bringing in a lot of new brands, particularly on the contemporary side and continue to do that. So I just wondered if you push that a little bit more in order to keep that uniqueness in the stores. Is that a way of getting around the overall promotional environment on bigger brands? And then, just if you could talk a little bit about the new national marketing campaign that you've just started also as a way of maybe driving traffic into the stores.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yes, this is Pete. You highlighted the balancing act that we need to try to figure out. And you can bring new brands in, that's great. That has its own risk. And brands don't grow to be really huge businesses overnight. It takes a bit of time to get it there. So we have some fairly big brands that have had some pretty sizable decreases over the last year. I mean the good news is, we've got some new brands coming up that we think can fill that void. I think one of the messages we were able to send to market this last week is, we have open to buy, even though business has been pretty difficult, because we're looking to replace some of these brands that are a little more troubled by some of that promotional activity. Their sales aren't as good.","So good news is, I think we attract a lot of people into doing business with you. Maybe the best example of that is, you look at some brands that we have that other people don't, so, Madewell, for example. J.Crew brand, it's not available at other retailers. It's something they'd sell themselves, but they sell to us because they like the way we do business, they like our customer, and it's been really effective. And you get insulated from some of these issues because it's not available at a lot of the stores that are a little more promotional in nature.","Topshop's been a version of that. Brandy Melville's a brand that's done really well for us. So there's good examples out there. And some of the stuff you talk about, some of the more leading-edge things around that contemporary business, we're proud of our team and their ability to kind of keep forging ahead. Though, ultimately, our ability to be successful going forward is not by repeating and refining last year, but to try to find new things out there to buy new things to do that will kind of stimulate customers' interest. And that's really our inspiration and our process going forward this year.","And then you asked about the marketing campaign, and that was a little bit of a new deal that, a new campaign for spring that Olivia Kim helped create for us and it's interesting. It's cool. I think probably the best thing about it is, it reflects an optimism and kind of a cheerfulness which really should be what our business is about, particularly as you come into spring. When there's a lot of stuff going on out there that maybe isn't super cheerful and bright, but our job is to make shopping fun for customers and I think that's what that campaign really reflects. And so far, at least the anecdotal evidence is, customers really like that.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Great. Thank you.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dorothy.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. One for Mike on the share buyback. Are you still looking for the buyback in 2016 to be neutral to earnings versus the credit card transaction? And second question, can you help us out at all in terms of the value of the sales shift of the semiannual sale between Q2 and Q3, and why you're moving it? Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Yes, Jeff, in terms of the buyback, the volume of buyback that we completed in the fourth quarter approximately will have the impact next year of being neutral to the loss of the credit card revenue on an EPS basis. So that's done. That's complete. In terms of the sales shift, I don't have \u2013 do we have that number?","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","When we...","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","The calendar shift?","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Yes. When we shift.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Do we know the comp impact?","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Yes, it's about 200 basis points to 300 basis points between quarters.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","I'm sorry?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","I would just add the Anniversary shift. Number one, Anniversary, really want to distinguish it from our other events. It's not \u2013 we used to do a (34:10) half-yearly sale. It's not a clearance sale. Anniversary is our biggest event. It's brand-new product that we bring in at savings and then market back up afterwards. And being our biggest event, the timing is really important. With the way that calendar works, about every five years to seven years, we need to bump it back as it starts to get too close to the Fourth of July holiday, and that's the case this year.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. So I just want to make sure I understand. The earnings-per-share guidance you're giving of $3.10 to $3.35 assumes that credit and the share buyback offset each other.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael G.

Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","As a follow-up to some of the questions on the Rack, can you just talk a little bit more about the relationship between the full-line assortment and the Rack assortment more recently and whether that's changed? Perhaps more specifically, with the amount of full-line products in the Rack elevated and maybe even limit the open to buy there and are there any changes that you're thinking about to manage the two channels going forward?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Blake, do you want to take that?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Sure. With the growth of the new store account, though we've got some blips with full in-store transfer, it hasn't had any material impact at all within the Rack itself or individual store in terms of percent of goods from the full-line store or what we get in terms of close-outs from the vendors. So no change there at all.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. That's it for me.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I was wondering if you guys are seeing some deterioration in the Credit portfolio and maybe you could tell us what's behind the guidance of $70 million to $80 million of Credit EBIT you're expecting next year. It seems like even accounting for you guys only receiving about 50% of the former EBIT, that's a little low based on the run rate of about $200 million from last year. Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Yes, Tracy, this is Mike. In terms of the health of the Credit portfolio, it continues to be very strong. We're not seeing any deterioration in terms of the quality of the portfolio, the timeliness of payments, et cetera. You're very astute to pick up that number in the guidance because, in fact, we have said that the Credit EBIT would be roughly half of what it was. The difference is there is some purchase accounting-related adjustments that are in that number that primarily will only impact 2016. I believe it was in the range of $15 million to $17 million, but the actual credit card revenue that we would earn is right in line with what we had shared with you earlier.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So it's some one-time charges bringing that number down for next year?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. Mike, could you give a bit more color on EBIT guidance for 2016? You mentioned in the release that ex impairment charges, we should look for retail EBIT, I think, up or down 3%? And from your earlier comments, it sounds like gross margins will continue to be pressured while with some of your SG&A savings, that actually might be closer to flattish on a rate basis. Just want to see if that is directionally right. And then my follow-up, still on EBIT, is on the slide in your presentation that calls out the $110 million EBIT impact from strategic initiatives next year. If you can just break that out for us between Canada and Trunk Club and give us an update on how we expect those segments to ramp over time. Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Yes, Paul, in terms of how you've framed the EBIT next year, I think that's directionally accurate. We didn't give any specific guidance on SG&A but your comments are relatively close. In terms of the strategic investments, the $110 million, that's Canada, Trunk Club and HauteLook. That's the impact that those investments have had, a combination of operating profits or losses plus any purchase accounting adjustments. That's an improvement in 2016 from 2015 and we expect that continue to improve fairly measurably over the next couple of years. We haven't specifically called it out. We haven't broken them down individually for purposes of this, but directionally we expect to see improvement, and I think that aligns with my earlier comment that part of the improvement we are seeing is the maturing of some of these investments as they start to scale up and approach breakeven and then start to make some money.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I'm trying to understand the significant inflection and the cadence of the EPS growth here front half, back half at high level, despite the first half being down 30%. I mean the second half it seems like EBITDA has to grow 15% to 20%. I'm having trouble figuring out how to get there on the margin guidance. Maybe you could talk us through a little bit, just at high-level how to think about comps to model first half versus second half on the gross margin that you guys see first half, second half? And, Mike, did I interpret your comments earlier thinking that SG&A is going to be fairly similar through the year?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, let me just take it on at a high level, Michael. The first thing which is pretty significant is the impact of the credit card sale. Recall last year we sold the business in October which means we were fully earning 100% of our credit card earnings through the first half of the year. Going into 2016 through the first half of the year we will be on the revenue sharing program so that's having an impact. The second thing is, and it's been a phenomenon over the last couple of years, is with the amount of stores that we've been opening, we have two new stores opening in Canada, we have a number of Rack stores opening, we have a fair amount of preopening that sits in the spring that we don't get a lot of sales benefit from and that it kicks into the back half of the year and so that's the other element.","And then the third element we called out was the shift in the Anniversary sales. So those are the big three. You know in terms of specific margin guidance, I'm not going to get into that level of detail here on the call right now but I think if you look at those three large directional elements, hopefully that will help you.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Is there any way you'd be willing to bless the (41:34) first half you guys are baking in negative same-store sales and then the second half is when we see that improvement. If, as an assumption, just what we're seeing around the industry and your comments on the run rate today?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As I said, we're not giving any specific guidance and I appreciate your persistence.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Well, I had to try. All right. Thanks, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bob Drbul of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good evening. I just have one question. On the expense opportunities in 2016, you talk about trying to improve efficiencies around fulfillment. Can you just elaborate on some of the initiatives that you are undertaking within lower shipping cost and fulfillment cost?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Bob, I would say again a lot of these go back to how we need to continue to view the customer experience not just by channel but across the enterprise, and understanding how we can serve the customer on an enterprise level. And there's a number of things we can do. Currently today, we fulfill out of multiple locations and are there opportunities for us to get more efficient at that? That creates not only additional labor cost but it creates additional shipping cost because you're shipping multiple items per an order. We're also looking at how spread out we want our assortment to be, because the more lower-price items we have in it, the less unit profitability we gain.","And so we're looking at a number of different things but I think it all goes back to the rapid acceleration of the business, and us continuing to feed that business and gain market share and now we're learning an awful lot about how that business is behaving and how we can make it more productive.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

You mentioned private label or Nordstrom's own brand. Can you comment on the percent of total sales that represents today and how much bigger it could be? And then given the success of Beauty, do you have any initiatives in the Beauty category to take advantage of that great strength?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yes, this is Pete. Traditionally, we've run our Nordstrom Product Group to our own label to a fairly consistent percentage. As we've done more designer business in the last, oh gosh, 15 years or so, it came down a little bit because that's the place where we just don't participate, and also with Beauty, as you talk about, if those two areas are big growth vehicles for us. It's some place we don't participate with our own label product. But we do for example, which we haven't talked about yet, but the young customer segment of our business, what we call women's apparel, which has a large component of our own label in it and that's been growing well.","It's a little over 10% of our business. It's not going to change dramatically from that. But I mean can we do some more? Yes, we can do some more and we've pretty much been doing it not as an entitlement program where NPGs can be a certain percentage of the business, but it has to grow because organically it belongs and customers have responded well to it. So the good news is, customers have responded well to it. We've got some good momentum in a lot of places. Like the kids brand like Tucker + Tate, with just in three years, I think it is. We're probably doing $50 million in there, so that is a big business for us. There's a lot of confidence and a lot of great results there to work towards. So, yes, we think we can grow it in modest ways in the next few years.","Related to Beauty, that's a really interesting business and the thing that's probably best about it is, where most customers enter Nordstrom, the most amount of trips come through the Beauty business. It tends to attract newer, younger customers, as well, and so when that business is healthy it really helps the acquisition part of what we're doing. It helps the traffic in the stores. So I think what we continue to focus on there is making sure that we keep moving forward. And because we've been pretty successful in there, we do attract a lot of interesting opportunities.","And I think one of the things that's particularly good about that business is the diversity where the success is coming from, because it's coming really at all different price points. The designer and luxury part of that business is really strong. A lot of the new things we've introduced are strong in different categories. We've got a good team there. So, I think you'll just see us continue to try to follow the customers' interest there and make sure that we're best in class in that classification.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And if I could just ask one more. If you could comment on the environment, obviously, the environment is tough particularly for apparel retailers and wondering what your take on it is. What might be the cause of this?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Gosh. That's a great question. I don't know. Some of the stuff is somewhat cyclical. But if we get into a position of trying to rationalize it based on external or macro factors that we can't control, then that's not a very good place for us to be. So what we really try to focus on are the things that we can control and that's delivering great service for customers, having a great relevant experience for them, both online and in stores, seamless integration, new products for them to buy, the excitement of what retailing can provide, And we talk about in terms of marketing, the hopefulness and the cheerfulness of what this is about. And I think if we can keep that front and center then we can continue to earn customers' business and gain market share. So that's the way we're looking at it.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","And we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. One quick follow-up on the Nordstrom Rack business. If you look at the different store age groups, have you been able to glean anything from how the stores mature? They open really big at first and then kind of steady comps from there, or is there a pattern you can see across the Rack specifically and that store network? The maturation curve, if you will.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","So, Omar, this is Blake. And we do have those facts and we've been doing this for a while, and it's been running pretty consistent in terms of our plans or projections for the first year and what it does then in year two, year three, year four and what that maturity curve is. And so, yes, that's helpful for us as we run the business and we haven't seen a lot of change there in that regard.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Is that to say, they open at a pretty high level of productivity?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Yes. They come right out of the gate at a high productivity and they start contributing very quickly.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Omar.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now introduce Rob Campbell, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin, sir.","Robert E. Campbell","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the Nordstrom conference call, which will last 45 minutes and include 30 minutes for your questions. As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom Inc.; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's second quarter performance  and outlook for fiscal 2012. During the Q&A session, we will be joined by Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Stores.","Before we begin, I wanted to mention that Blake and Mike will be using slides that can be viewed in the Investor Relations section of our website. If you're listening to this conference call as a webcast, you should already see the title slide. If you're listening by telephone, you can view the slides by going to investor.nordstrom.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Hello, everyone. I'm happy to provide an overview of our company's progress as we reached the halfway point of 2012. There's a lot of momentum in our company with multiple initiatives driving substantial top line growth and full-line Rack and our Direct business.","We just completed our Anniversary Sale and once again we were thrilled by the customer response with high volumes of traffic both in-store and online and sales through July that were above our expectation. The overarching theme in our company continues to be about improving the customer experience across all channels. It is reflected in our top line results and in the increasing number of growth opportunities that are emerging.","I'd like to take a few moments to review our progress along these lines in the second quarter. There are several slides we've made available on our website in the Investor Relations section as a supplement to our comments. The first slide highlights some of our recent growth initiatives.","We are excited to announce in June our plans to open a full-line store in New York City. In one sense, it's the culmination of efforts for over a decade defined what we believe is an outstanding location for our flagship store in the world's premier city for retailing. In another sense, it's a beginning as we go through the process of preparing for what we hope will be the highest volume store in our company and an opportunity to further elevate and extend our brand. We look forward to its opening, which we anticipate will occur in 2018.","The Rack continues to execute well, increasing its market share while achieving high sales productivity, EBIT margins and return on invested capital. Recognizing its growth potential several years ago, we embarked on a more ambitious store expansion plan for the Rack. Over the last 4 years, the number of Racks has more than doubled to 110 today. Based on what we've experienced during this period and how our customers responded, we see an opportunity for even greater acceleration in its growth. We will continue with our plan to open a total of 15 Racks this year, and then increase to 24 openings in 2013. Its' likely that we'll have doubled our size again by 2016 with over 230 Rack stores. We are encouraged by the performance we've seen in this business and by the ongoing growth opportunity it represents to serve more customers.","Our Direct business followed its 44% sales increase in the first quarter with a 40% increase in the second quarter. It largely reflects the meaningful investments we're making to improve the customer experience in e-commerce, expanding selection, improving the site experience, expediting the checkout and delivery process and ultimately making it easier for our customers to shop. This year for the first time, our Fashion Rewards customers had the chance to shop online during the 9-day early-access period prior to the start of the event. And with the launch of the Nordstrom iPad app, coming later this month, we are excited to introduce some novel features that we think customers will appreciate.","We continue to leverage technology to improve the customer experience. We are constantly adding to the functionality of our mobile point-of-sale devices and their use in our stores is increasing. By the end of the year, they will have all of the capabilities of our existing cash registers. We've successfully tested mobile point-of-sale in the Rack and have seen its effectiveness in improving the shopping experience by speeding up the checkout process. We are in the process of rolling out around 1,500 of these devices to all of our Rack stores by the end of the third quarter.","For a number of years, we have leveraged strategic partnerships that we view as enablers to improving the customer experience. They've happened organically as an outgrowth of our ongoing efforts to elevate merchandise and channel execution. We've made acquisitions of Jeffrey and HauteLook and established partnerships with kidswear brand Peek and more recently men's online apparel retailer, Bonobos. These relationships provide opportunities such as increased access to product and customers and deeper knowledge of how to market to and build relationships with customers using technology. The most recent for us is our announced U.S. exclusive partnership with Topshop and Topman, internationally renowned leaders in offering newness in fashion at great prices. In September, we'll begin carrying merchandise in 14 of our stores as well as online. We'll learn a lot during this initial phase and anticipate expanding distribution in the future. As we said last quarter, we're moving fast and it's in response to the multiple opportunities that are in front of us. Growth is an increasingly meaningful part of our story, as we seek to continually enhance our platform for sustainable improvements in performance.","Now I'll turn over the call to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. In wrapping up the first half of the year, we are encouraged with the momentum in our business. As we aggressively pursue opportunities to evolve with the customer, whether it is in-store or online, we are seeing the benefits reflected in our top line results. We are excited about our investments in e-commerce, the acceleration of Rack expansion and our plans to open a flagship store in Manhattan. We have many efforts underway to improve the service experience and to stay relevant with existing and new customers.","Our financial position is strong, and we're seeing favorable trends in every channel. We have a demonstrated record of results from major technology and business initiatives from the implementation of perpetual inventory system some time ago to our more recent multi-channel efforts, which have driven significant profitable growth. This gives us confidence as we aggressively move forward on multiple growth opportunities to execute successfully and deliver long-term shareholder value.","Moving on to results. I'd like to make a couple of comments on our biggest sales event of the year. This year's Anniversary Sale exceeded our expectations, delivering same store sales increases in the high single-digit range on an apples-to-apples event-to-date basis through the end of July. This sale event, which drives significant volume for us, started 1 week later relative to last year causing 1 week of the sale to fall into our fiscal third quarter. As a result, the event shift drove an unfavorable comparison for the second quarter, but is expected to have a favorable impact to the third quarter comparisons.","Taking that into consideration, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results, which exceeded our expectations. Our performance reflected strong top line results with earnings per diluted share of $0.75, compared to $0.80 last year.","Next, I'd like to focus on sales. With 11 consecutive quarters of same-store sales increases, our sales performance continues to exceed expectations. Total net sales in the quarter increased 7% while same-store sales increased 4.5%. Nordstrom same-store sales, which include our full-line and Direct businesses, were up 4.9%, with Handbags, Women's Shoes and Cosmetics as our top-performing merchandise categories. Same-store sales at full-line increased 1.1%, with the South and Midwest as our top-performing regions. Direct continues to be our fastest-growing channel, with sales growth of 40% over last year. With 6 doors open to date this year, Nordstrom Rack delivered a total net sales increase of 19% and same-store sales increase of 7.7%.","Let's now move on to gross profit. Second quarter gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 98 basis points over last year to 35.6%. The decrease is primarily attributable to a combination of planned deleverage in buying and occupancy expenses, resulting from the Anniversary Sale event shift and strategic growth initiatives, including our enhanced Fashion Rewards program and free online shipping and returns.","We launched our enhanced Fashion Rewards program earlier this year and have been pleased with the favorable response, which is indicative of our efforts to develop new customer relationships and deepen existing ones. In the first half of 2012, new accounts grew by over 20% on top of last year's 66%. Additionally, our rewards customers are spending roughly 20% more with us relative to last year and we continue to see increases in the overall penetration rate on our cards.","Now, I'd like to discuss our inventory performance. Total sales per square foot increased 4.5% while our ending inventory per square foot increased 17.7%. Our elevated inventory levels largely reflected a planned buildup of inventory related to the second week of the Anniversary Sale, which shifted into August. In addition, a portion of the inventory increase is a function of our growth initiatives, including the expansion of our Rack business. As a result, our inventory turn of 5.3x was down from Q2 of 2011, but we are on track to meet or exceed our all-time high in inventory turn achieved in each of the last 2 years.","The percentage of regular price sales continued to increase relative to last year, which reflects our customers continuing preference for newness and the ongoing benefits from our multichannel capabilities.","Now I'd like to review our expense performance. Retail SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales, increased 61 basis points over last year. The increase was driven by higher planned fulfillment costs associated with increased speed of delivery and increased planned technology costs related to the acceleration of our e-commerce investments, which began in the latter half of 2011. As Blake mentioned, these investments support our ongoing efforts to enhance the overall customer experience through our e-commerce capabilities, expanded product selection and improved convenience. Consistent with the first quarter, our in-store business delivered incremental profits on incremental sales that are in line with our recent historical performance.","Moving to credit. We continue to see improving trends in our credit metrics. Our delinquency rate improved to 1.9% of receivables versus 2.7% last year. We ended the quarter with bad debt reserves as a percent of ending credit card receivables of 4.6%, down from 5.6% last year.","Our financial position remains strong, with $1.3 billion of cash and total liquidity of $2.1 billion. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.2X is well within the range of investment grade.","During the quarter, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $49.50 for a total of $373 million. We have $696 million remaining under our existing authorization.","Now I will discuss our updated outlook for 2012, which factors in the year-to-date performance and our plans for the second half of the year. Due to the impact of the Anniversary Sale event shift, we provided directional comments in the earnings release on the timing of certain line items over the remaining quarters of 2012. We increased our expectations to achieve 2012 earnings per diluted share of between $3.40 to $3.50, including a benefit of $0.08 from year-to-date share repurchases. In addition, we raised our full year same-store sales guidance to between 6% and 7%.","Our updated gross profit outlook incorporates our current view of the impact of multiple growth initiatives underway across all channels. The increase in our SG&A guidance also is a function of growth in our business with higher sales volume causing increased variable expenses.","Consistent with what we shared last quarter, we expect to see improvements in expense leverage in the back half of the year, as we begin to anniversary some of our existing strategic growth initiatives.","In closing, our focus on enhancing the customer experience is delivering strong growth and increasing market share. As we look ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, we are excited about the opportunities we see and the expanded ways to serve our customers. We are on track with achieving our long-term financial goals of high single-digit top line growth and mid-teens return on invested capital.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Now let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was very impressed with the Rack strategy through 2016. Can you just talk about if there's any change in terms of the real estate perspective? And how should we think about owned versus leased and what is with strip mall versus outlet? Give any color you can provide will be very helpful.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Deborah, this is Blake. I think we've shared in the past that our customers really prefer a convenient parking easy in and out. So being in a strip mall type environment with attractive co-tenancies has really served us well, and we have not done many in terms of the traditional kind of outlet mall. We've done a couple and we have found that they are not quite as productive. One of the questions we had a while back as we accelerated growth was the availability of real estate. And to date, we've been very pleased with our ability to find good locations, in many cases, near our full-line stores. And so for the foreseeable future on the plans that we announced, we feel really good about our prospects of finding that necessary real estate.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, what could you learn from the early access to the Anniversary Sale online?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Erik? Could you take that, please?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Sure. Well, what we learned that we weren't great at planning it. It's being able the first year, we planned a little more shift than what actually occurred online. We know from other times of the year that our customers like to shop the channels on their terms. So we knew that it would be a positive overall, net positive, but -- quite a bit of a challenge, another piece of complexity as far as how much are planning for the stores and online. But besides that, it was pretty seamless. We had slight technical glitch the first day from the increase in traffic. Being that, again, anytime we do something really big for the first time online, it's hard to get a practice run on that. So there's a little learning technology-wise. But from a customer response, it worked very well. People appreciated the alternative. But there's also something with Anniversary Sale with the vast majority of our customers like coming in the store and seeing the full selection, touching it and feeling the energy in our stores.","Michael G. Koppel","Deborah, this is Mike. I would just add one other thing. From a Fashion Rewards perspective, we continue to gain a lot of new Fashion Rewards customers through the early access program and the additional benefits and that should help to play out over time as we continue to build that base.","Erik B. Nordstrom","Yes, it's a good point. I heard -- I don't know Mike said, as you think about early access, I'd ask you to think about it in 2 ways. One is certainly what it does for the Anniversary Sale in that time period, defined time period. But for what the second part -- and really is bigger. It's one of the best examples we have of the strategic benefit we have from owning our own credit card. Early Access is one of the most attractive benefit to our Fashion Rewards program, and it really is a big driver that's opening new Fashion Rewards accounts all through the year and gearing up for the Anniversary Sale. So we feel those benefits of significantly more Fashion Rewards account all throughout the year and not just stamp the Anniversary Sale.","Operator","Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Caris & Company.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about Women's apparel. You've brought or put in place a new GMM. You have a plan in place, I believe, that you want to execute. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on your progress there. You seem to see -- two, have seen a little bit of a pickup during anniversary, realized it's very early days but if you could just give us a little bit more color on what your plans are there.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Sure. This is Pete. We've put a new leader in place, so it's been probably about 60 days or so, we'll go now. And it's an internal candidate, her name is Tricia Smith. She's been with us for the last 22 years, I think, quite some time. She's a proven leader around here with a great track record of success. She was always a really good candidate. We kind of took our time because we wanted to really thoroughly vet outside Canada and we felt like we did that. And after weighing all those choices, we ended going with Tricia. And I think the benefit we get is that she was really able to start right away and get traction very quickly. There was no real learning curve there because she was incidentally familiar with all the issues we've been going through. I actually believe in this timeframe that we have that we were able to get traction very quickly in this transition, and not have to wait. So you're right, the business has actually improved in Women's. And I think the wave of an emotion on that for a while. In July, actually, our Women's business as a division finished above the average of the multi-channel. So it's positive for us, and I think we're going to continue to evolve our merchandise offering, and we keep saying these words be more modern and more relevant. And that seems to be the most appealing recipe for a broad segment of our customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike, could you just speak to the change in your retail SG&A leverage assumption in the second half? I think you guys were guiding 70 to 90 bps of leverage and now you're saying kind of 60 to 70 basis points. Is it just a function of variable expenses associated with higher sales or are you guys increasing your tax spend, can you just clarify that for us?","Michael G. Koppel","No -- yes, Chuck. This is Mike. No, the only difference is the fact that there's -- it is top line growth related. It's all volume and growth related. Our plans in terms of the initiatives we have in place are consistent with what they've been the last several quarters.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, my follow-up will be just given the strength in July and the Anniversary Sale, should we still expect August comps to be up mid-teens or was there more of a pull-forward effect in July that could dampen that August comp? If you could just clarify that for us, it would be great.","Michael G. Koppel","Well, we haven't guided comps on a monthly basis. But you should expect to be -- comps to perform higher than last year because of the shift into August -- of the Anniversary Sale into August.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I think earlier this year you have provided kind of a chart that diagrammed your thought around return on invested capital and margins. How does that change now that you've decided to accelerate Rack openings in 2013?","Michael G. Koppel","This is Mike. Really, nothing has changed materially. The Rack has a little bit different geography in terms of its financial performance and that's a  -- that the gross profit is lower but SG&A is also lower, but the EBIT margin tend to be slightly better than full line. And the return on capital is very strong. So I think if you look at it relative to the entire enterprise, it's not a material impact to those line items. But certainly if you look at the overall growth opportunity to the company, it is.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great and one follow-up, if I may. For the stores that you've changed and added mobile POS to a Rack locations, what have you done with the incremental space that you freed up and how does that change your square footage profile going forward?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Edward, this is Blake. Today, we haven't done anything material on the space. But it's a good question because that is one of the factors and determinants to embrace and also on adopting this mobile point-of-sale because we think we do have the opportunity to free up some space and reduce the amount of register we have at the front. So whether that's flex space or add to our accessory division, it provides more selling square footage on the floor and so it's one of the additional benefits. But it's driven with trying to improve the customer experience, the point-of-sale, and reducing the lines and a more one-on-one experience and the byproduct as we might free up some space. And so we hope the balance of this year to start implementing that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","I've wondered if you could talk about the results of the 2 e-mail blasts that were sent with the secret rewards card to your HauteLook and the Nordstrom non-cardholders, and I wondered if you received the response that you were looking for?","Michael G. Koppel","Jennifer, this is Mike. Yes, we did try that as a test this time. And the response was, I would say, relatively in line with what we've thought but it wasn't, I would say, a significant impact to our business. But it's all part of our learning and testing new marketing techniques with our multiple channels.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","Great. And I have a follow-up. I wanted to know if you had more full priced merchandise on the floor during anniversary because it looked like you did. And did your customer purchase more full priced merchandise, that being non-Anniversary merchandise items during the sale when double points started.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. It's a good question. Yes, I think, our results would bear out that we did well with the full price offering. But I think probably the best story there is our sell-through on the anniversary product was up significantly over last year, and that bodes really well for our profitability going forward, as we can kind of clear through that. So we exceeded our plans as you look at it through the end of July, and what we accomplished to the sale there. But I -- typically or basically, sales look well for us when we can establish a good balance, and I would say that what happened here for the sale, again, through July, definitely was in line and exceeded our expectations.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer from Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk about how you've aligned your processes and teams to align the buying personnel across HauteLook, Rack and full-line? Kind of how long have they been working together and how much more opportunity do you think there is here to really leverage your various channels? And also along with that, could you please share HauteLook's sales increase?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Erika, this is Mike. We've made some pretty good progress this year in terms of, number one, just understanding the opportunity across our various channel to better lever our relationships in the market. And it's not only been HauteLook with Rack but it's also been HauteLook, Rack and full-line. And our ability to understand the great relationships we have with some good brands and being able to provide various channels to sell their product through at different stages of their life cycle. So we're making good progress there. We have a lot to go. It's a lot of work and it requires a lot of coordination. But some of the early results of that have been very good. So we're going to continue to work on that going forward. In terms of where we are with sales, we still anticipate a 50% to 60% sales increase with HauteLook this year over last year. The business continues to be operating at or slightly above its plan, and we continue to be encouraged.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. And then, could you just please clarify, you mentioned that multiple investments will impact gross margin in the back half of the year. I believe before you'd talked about kind of near flat, down 10 to up 10 basis points. Could you share a little bit more here about what changed?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Erika. And it's on the gross profit line, just to be clear about that. It's a continuation. We've had a stronger, I would say, stickiness to our Fashion Rewards program and a number of those benefits get reflected in gross profit. So we're seeing a stronger uptake there. We continue to see the free returns, the free shipping and free returns slightly impact that line. And then certainly, with the growth of the Rack, which is growing at a faster pace than full line, that line item tends to average down a little bit because the gross profit Rack is slightly lower.","Operator","Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira from Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, I just had a few questions. First, on the Early Access on the Fashion Rewards. Obviously, some learnings but great success. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about perhaps in taking those learnings and introducing that Early Access in other future events, maybe during the holiday season or other times in the year?","Michael G. Koppel","Adrianne, at this point, we don't have any plans for Early Access for our other major events. As you know, our only 2 other major events are Half Yearly clearance sales. We do offer double points for those. But at this point, we haven't looked at Early Access.","Blake W. Nordstrom","I would say, Adrianne, this is Blake. I think we look at it throughout the year just in total of the subject of loyalty. And Early Access was one way for us to connect better with our customers and provide meaningful value for them. And we're looking throughout the year to do that and there's lots of ways to do that. So we're encouraged by it. But as Mike said, I don't see us replicating that Early Access, how we can execute it in other times during the year. But there is learnings with having a good relationship with the customer and how we, in a personalized way, can serve them.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, and in many ways, the Early Access online was the progression of how that sale has functioned. In the past we did it by folks just coming in the store. And over the years, we've made that process more efficient. And now -- and with the continued emergence of online as relevant channel, it kind of played very well into that.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my second question, Mike, as it relates to inventory we appreciate the explanation in terms of the inventory growth. But now as we think about Rack assuming an accelerated run rate of growth, how do we think about inventory plans and how are you striking that and what sort -- what should we be thinking about sort of as a normal run rate, given the higher comp and also the higher Rack growth?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, as we've said in the past, we don't give guidance on the inventory. But I will say that certainly you'll see that moderate toward the back half of the year as just from the fact that the anniversary had a significant impact on that growth in the second quarter. But particularly with the Rack where we've been more aggressive in our channels and procuring products and we're growing that, you're likely going to see that a little faster than the average for the near term.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the CapEx implications for the new Rack openings for next year and then also any updated thoughts on use of free cash flow after the CapEx?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Lorraine. This is Mike. In terms of the Rack impact, quite frankly, it's relatively immaterial to the CapEx. Those stores are primarily all leased stores and the FF and the build-out is relatively small. And so in terms of some of the flexibility we have in CapEx, it's really not going to impact that at all. I'm sorry, the second part?","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Any update on uses of free cash flow?","Michael G. Koppel","Oh, Yes. I would say, Lorraine, it's still very consistent. We try to maintain a balanced capital allocation program based on, number one, putting our investment back into the business where we continue to get some very high returns and balancing that with returning the shareholders through our dividend program and through our share repurchase. And as you can see, this past quarter, we had a pretty advantageous periods, we repurchase shares and we took advantage of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the percentage of cross shopping between Rack and Nordstrom? Update us on that. Full-line stores, what about cross shopping between Rack and HauteLook? And another question on HauteLook. At what point do we think about HauteLook becoming accretive? Will that happen at Christmas time this year, or fourth quarter, or next year, or what?","Blake W. Nordstrom","So Barbara, this is Blake. We've shared in the past that there is some synergy, there is synergy that we value and the customer values between the full-line stores and the Rack. We've never broken out a specific number that we are able to approximate it. It's not the majority of the business, it's considerably less than that. But there is the customer that goes back and forth that likes both shopping environments and there are opportunities for us as a company to, again, in a personalized way whether through our loyalty and other manners communication, their vehicles, create a meaningful connection for the various channels that we have. There's also relationships with HauteLook that you talked about as well. And so, I think, as Mike said earlier, we're on a pretty steep learning curve there. We're finding on how to use these tools, how to work more closely with these customers and how to leverage and maximize the various channels we have. We think it definitely is an advantage. Our customers certainly view it that way, and we're excited over the next couple of years to try to maximize that.","Michael G. Koppel","Barbara, as far as the second part of your question, as far as the accretive impact of HauteLook, we expect HauteLook this year to approach the breakeven level. And I don't think you're going to see the accretive this year and our plans going forward, certainly, we would expect that at some point in time.","Operator","Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can look into the second half of the year and let us know what the comp rate needed would be in order to keep the SG&A as a percentage of sales flat. In other words, what's your leverage point? And then looking at credit earnings here, it looks like in both the second quarter and the year-to-date period, credit income or rather the credit earnings number is running a bit below last year level. Do you think that continues into the second half of the year? And maybe you could just talk about some of the drivers there.","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Kimberly. This is Mike. In terms of the first part of your question, I mean, we are levering SG&A in the back half of the year. In terms of the break even, we really haven't broken that out. But I think if you look at the path of the business and look at the top line growth and the fact that we are starting to anniversary some of that acceleration of spent last year, we are seeing some leverage. In terms of the second part of your question, there were 2 basic drivers as to why the credit business was down. The largest one is that we had the Fashion Rewards component that's included in the credit business and that was the biggest increase because we continue to see a very strong uptake in terms of new customers and in terms of utilization of benefit. And then also because the company had taken on more debt over last year, we did see an increase in the allocation of interest expense to that business. The other thing you're also seeing is that last year, we had larger reductions in the reserve than we had this year. And so that's having an impact as well. So those are the drivers. But in terms of the overall health of the credit business, in terms of the traditional credit metrics, it continues to be very strong.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Swinand from MorningStar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess, I'm thinking about the Rack, I know you've shared the strong return metrics for it and obviously the increased growth is interesting, exciting. But with all the off-price channels being up, can you give us some comfort or any indication, analysis that you've had that you can go -- that it's a differentiated product. I guess, I'm just worried about to sort of skating to where the puck is now versus where it's going to be. Maybe you could talk about how the Rack performs versus when other off-price competitors are in the area. I'm not sure how to frame the question, but can you give us some cover that it's as differentiated as the Nordstrom full-line stores?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, Paul, this is Blake. And I think you're asking a question. But we do believe there is differentiation, though, I don't think we approach it or try to execute it in the sake of differentiation. But there is a different experience within our Rack than there is whether that be HauteLook or catalogs or full-line stores. We have said, though, that there is a synergy. The Rack just like the full-line stores, benefits from a strong and vibrant retail community. So if we are neighbors next to strong competitors, the customer ultimately wins. But there's a strong selection there and we have a good results. So just like the full-line stores, we aspire to be in the absolute best retail locations across the country. The real driver there is our ability to -- there's issues like people and we talked about real estate and supply chain but product, having the best product and having the best brands and the right trends and tremendous values and so has been alluded to during to this call, our ability to work with our vendor partners and really talk to them about being accretive and being positive to their brand and reputation across all channels, and do we have an opportunity to maybe get access or first call on that product. And so as we've gotten a little larger, it's actually benefited us to be able to, at times when there is closeouts, take all the merchandise. And so it's gotten better as we've gotten larger. And really when we look at the top vendors within full-line stores, we currently carry 49 out of the 50 top vendors in the full-line stores in our Rack. And at this moment in time, we're encouraged. The last part is there's tremendous flexibility with the Rack. So as we announced, I talked about this growth, if for some reason down the road we run into some hurdles, real estate people, IT, but predominantly merchandise availability, we can pretty quickly back off. But right now, given the strong consumer demand, given our results, given the gains we're making into our execution with the Rack, we definitely have the confidence to take this next step.","Michael G. Koppel","And I would add just one other thing because I think Blake is probably a little bit humble to say this. But I think with our Rack stores, we certainly have the differentiation of the credibility of the Nordstrom brand. And so everything we're doing to improve the customer experience, helps us differentiate the Rack experience from other off-price, and I think more recent example is the mobile POS in our ability to move brands from full-line into the Rack. So I think those are points that help us as we continue to grow.","Operator","Our next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","In terms of the Rack, I'm sorry, I don't mean to beat a dead horse. Have you done any research that sort of tells you what your core customers' viewpoint of the brand is and how that's changed at all with the growth in the Rack? And as we see that business grow, will you see the -- I'm assuming you'll see the amount of transfers kind of get down to below 10%. Does that impact the customers experience in that channel at all? And then finally on the Rack, it seems as though this growth is really highly scalable. There isn't like a bunch of new people or processes that you'll need to add in order to fund this growth.","Blake W. Nordstrom","This is Blake. I think there were a couple of questions in there. You might -- I was writing them down. You might have to help me on the first one again. Could you summarize that first one again?","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I'm just looking for -- does the presence of Rack out there in the marketplace damage at all the impression that your full-line customer has about your brand?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Right, thank you. And that reminds me now that you did talk about what work that maybe we did or we learn from our customer and their view about it. That was really the impetus prior to the economic downturn in '08, where we were working in '06 in '07 about growing it. And we have purposely put more of our focus on the full-line stores and they kind of have some restraint on Rack growth. And there was such an outpouring of demand or desire from the customer to have more selection, more choices, more locations that we picked up this growth. And with that, it's been very, very favorable. It has far exceeded our expectations. Trust us that we are very sensitive to the Nordstrom brand and the core business, the full-line stores. Today, we think it's been very complementary, and we think it has benefited the company as a whole. So I think it's fair to say as a management team, that it is a very important subject for us and one that we put considerable thought and energy behind it. And that's why we feel strong at this point and why, maybe, we've taken some time because some of your peers have asked us in the past, why don't you accelerate this growth? And so I think we've been very purposeful about it and will continue to monitor that. But at this point, the customers very favorably. Your last comment was about the balance of merchandise. And yes, as we accelerate that growth, it lessens to a degree, the amount from full-line stores. But I would remind you that we have a very robust e-commerce business. So even with this accelerated Rack growth, if we look at it in total, from a multi-channel point of view, it really is a materially changing much from a percentage point of view, the amount of goods we get from both online and the full-line stores. So we're very comfortable with those balances at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Fuhrman from Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little about the mobile check out devices that you're rolling out to Rack and specifically also you talked about adding some functionality to the hardware, I think, at your full-line stores as well. What is the increased functionality we should expect to see rolled out? And I guess, the hardware you have on these devices, how many years of extra functionality add-ons do you think that can support?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, in terms of the full-line stores, Erik, do you want to talk about what's happening there?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Yes. I believe we're up over 75% of our fixed POS capability is now on to our mobile device. And by end of the year, we'll get 100%. And as we get into next year, we'll actually have -- we'll have more functionality on the mobile devices than we have on the registers. We've added a lot this year, things like return capabilities. There's some personal book capabilities that still need to be added so that will get us to the 100%. The mobile device -- I think you asked it this way, they're fairly different, the benefits and the usage in the full-line stores and the Rack. Full-line stores, there's a lot more functionality that we look to have on them. And while there is certainly some speed and convenience benefits, there is more of the benefits of that one-to-one personal interaction between the salesperson and the customer. It can happen -- it doesn't happen at the counter with other people around. It can happen in the dressing room, it can happen at the shoe store. And all that functionality is going to be around our personal book features and being able to more personalize our connection with the customers. For the Rack, it's a little easier to understand and draw the direct line benefits. It's speed. It just makes that line significantly shorter. And as Blake touched on earlier, there is that space-saving of taking prime real estate at Rack when we have to checkout counters and being able to reduce those. The benefits are clear, we can -- and the functionality is there right now. So we can be much more aggressive in rolling out the mobile POS devices in the Rack. But full-line stores, the rollout is -- it coincides with the increase in functionality.","Operator","And our final question today is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","A lot of discussions around, obviously, growth and partnerships. How do you see the partnerships going forward contributing to sales and margin expansion? And what are the categories would appeal to you in terms of a partnership? And just lastly on Christmas, anything in terms of planning Christmas this year, whether it's days, inventory plans, how it will be different from last year?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete, I'll take the partnership thing. To date, that's all worked on a very kind of organic way. It's not like we've set out to go -- get into these partnerships. They've just evolved in a very natural way, which I think has been the reason why they have been successful. We typically gone for things that are probably smaller with a chance of getting bigger over time, which is probably good thing, too. I would say, the latest partnership deal we have with Topshop is a big one, potentially, for us. And that came up relatively organically, it happened very quickly. The folks at Topshop have been great to work with. I think they see where the mutual opportunity is and was easy to get along. So we're super excited about that one, and we think that we're going to learn a lot here in the next few months and we have a chance to expand this really throughout maybe all our stores. So I think we'll continue to look at things that are opportunistic for us. And in the case of Topshop deal, specifically, and was similar when we got involved with Jeffrey is, it was taking a product opportunity and using a brand like that, that can help make us better. And with the Topshop example, they are highly credible and super well-regarded amongst young, fashion customers and we had a chance to get a line with them in a way exclusive in this country and frankly got us -- it is going to act as a catalyst for us to, again, make our offer more modern and more relevant. So it's a good deal for us.","Michael G. Koppel","Dana, this is Mike. And the second part of your question, regarding Christmas. We haven't made any material changes to our plans or outlook. Every year the calendar shifts, but it seems like every year people still buy. They may buy more in fewer days or less in more dates, but they still buy. And at this point in time, that's how we're thinking about it.","Robert E. Campbell","This is Rob Campbell. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call.

If you are listening to this conference call as a webcast, you should already see the title slide."," "," With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone.","As we've communicated in the past, we recognize that customers have a growing number of options regarding their shopping experience. The consistency of the customer experience, both in-store and online, and things like selection, multichannel capabilities, personalization, speed, convenience and price, all are becoming more important. Simply stated, we want to be the retailer of choice whenever, however, wherever customers choose to shop by providing a superior customer experience.","As we continue our efforts to improve the level of service in our stores, we also have accelerated our investments to elevate the customer experience in e-commerce. This is where we saw the highest year-over-year sales increase in 2011 and it's where we expect the strongest growth in the future.","There were a number of highlights in 2011. For the full year, our company achieved an all-time high in sales, which exceeded $10 billion. We ended the year with same-store sales up 7.2% on top of the 8.1% increase that we achieved in 2010. Our regular-priced selling remains at historically high levels, which is indicative of the integrity of our pricing and the fashion and newness in our offering."," "," We continue to challenge ourselves on inventory turn. In 2011, we reached 5.6x, matching our all-time best in 2010 and a tribute to the high level of execution of our merchants.","Our company performance reflects the progress we've made in many parts of our business. Full-line grew same-store sales of 6% while opening new stores in Delaware, Nashville and a second store in St. Louis. We continued our efforts to connect salespeople with more customers to make the shopping experience better. Over the last 3 years, we've roughly tripled the number of personal stylists in our program and now have close to 1,300. They represent some of our best salespeople and are leading our efforts in building one-on-one relationships with our customers and improving the overall customer experience. We enhanced the ability of our salespeople to serve customers with the rollout of mobile point-of-sale devices and e-receipt capabilities."," "," Part of our effort in connecting and deepening relationships with new and existing customers is through our Fashion Rewards program, with over 2.6 million active participants. A month ago, we announced a number of enhancements which give customers more control over how and when they can earn rewards and extends more benefits to our cardholders."," "," Our Direct business grew close to 30% in 2011. We took a number of steps during the year to raise our level of service and accelerate overall e-commerce growth.","We launched  online free shipping and free returns in September, which had a significant impact on direct sales and generated incremental profit. We followed that with a small pilot of same-day delivery for online orders, and we're continuing to build the knowledge in this area.","We implemented a Nordstrom app for iPhones and Androids, upgraded our website while enhancing our mobile website to make both easier to use and improve the speed and quality of the delivery of merchandise to customers."," "," We're also adding close to 400 employees with e-commerce expertise and experience to complement our existing Direct team, giving us the combined capabilities necessary to drive growth in this space.","At this time last year, we announced our acquisition of HauteLook. It gives us access to an emerging, growing channel and allowed us to partner with a talented team. The business, as a standalone, generated a sales increase of roughly 60% during the year while nearly doubling its membership to over 7.5 million today. We anticipate robust growth in this business to continue with ongoing opportunities to share learnings that benefit us across channels.","Several years ago, we accelerated the expansion of our Rack business, and over this period, our market share has grown significantly. The Rack crossed the $2 billion threshold in 2011. We opened 18 stores during the year, leading to 21% total sales growth. Our Rack business also generated growing increases in same-store sales throughout much of the year, reflecting ongoing initiatives to get the best product at the best price."," "," As far as initiatives for 2012, we are planning the following: adding to the functionality of mobile point-of-sale devices and expanding their usage in full-line and Rack stores, enhancing the overall Web and mobile Web experience, building out our IT infrastructure to fuel our e-commerce growth, beginning implementation of enhanced tools to improve the initial allocation and assortment of inventory, expanding online merchandise selection and developing a more customized approach to all aspects of our engagement with customers."," "," In closing, though we're moving faster than we ever have, we remain committed to the level of discipline and execution that have served us well. We're encouraged by the benefits we're already beginning to see from the investments we're making from the positive response we're getting from our customers and the strength of our top line performance. We are confident that our heightened focus in e-commerce, coupled with ongoing opportunities in our stores, will enable us to further enhance our ability to serve and remain relevant with customers. In doing so, we're enhancing what we believe is a terrific foundation to best serve our customers today and in the future.","I'd now like to turn it over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake.","Our fourth quarter results illustrated our continued execution of our operating plans, along with an aggressive strategy to grow our business. During the year, we not only achieved record sales but completed back-to-back years of almost 13% growth in total sales. We also realized a double-digit increase in earnings before interest and income taxes or EBIT for the second consecutive year and we achieved this while making significant investments to build on our platform for growth. Whether it's increasing sales across channels or the initiatives underway to improve the customer experience and grow our customer base, we believe we are on track to achieve our overall financial goals of mid-teen total shareholder returns.","For the full year, our earnings per diluted share were $3.14 and our EBIT totaled $1.2 billion. This is an increase of 14.2% in diluted earnings per share and an increase of 11.7% in EBIT compared with the fiscal year  2010.","For the fourth quarter, our earnings per diluted share were $1.11 and EBIT totaled $417 million. This was an increase of 6.7% in diluted earnings per share and an increase of 2.8% in EBIT compared with the same period in 2010.","Same-store sales in the fourth quarter were up 7.1%. Nordstrom same-store sales, which includes results from our full-line and Direct businesses, were up 8.4%, with the South and Midwest as our top-performing regions. Handbags, Designer and Cosmetics were our top-performing merchandise categories.","Sales in our Direct business grew 35% in the fourth quarter. Nordstrom Rack net sales grew 17.7% in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales up 2.2%. As Blake mentioned, we opened 18 Nordstrom Rack stores this year and anticipate 15 openings in 2012. The sales productivity and return on investment continue to make expansion of this concept a compelling opportunity.","Fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 12 basis points to 37.7%. The improvement was driven entirely by leveraging buying and occupancy costs.","Total sales per square foot increased 8.4% while inventory per square foot increased 13.3%. We believe this is appropriate given the anticipated growth in our business and recognizing that last year's inventory level was lower than planned.","We ended the year with inventory turn of 5.6, in line with our 2010 record high, attributable in part to an increase in the percentage of regular-priced sales and reflective of the ongoing benefits from our multichannel capabilities.","Retail SG&A increased $121 million compared to last year's fourth quarter. The increase was driven by various e-commerce initiatives and investments, including HauteLook, and by higher volume from existing and new stores. We continue to leverage SG&A expense in our stores with improvements of approximately 35 basis points over last year.","Now we'll turn to our performance in Credit. Positive trends continue as our customers are spending more in our stores and using our tenders as convenient methods to transact rather than building revolving credit. This is reflected in our delinquency, write-off and payment rates, each of which experienced favorable trends. As a result, we have reduced the reserve for bad debt by $10 million. This is in addition to $20 million of reductions taken earlier this year. We ended the quarter with bad debt reserves as a percentage of ending credit card receivables of 5.5%, down from 6.9% last year.","Our performance during the year added to the strength of our financial position. We generated free cash flow of $432 million. We have $1.9 billion of cash and total liquidity of approximately $2.7 billion. Our adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.4x is well within the range of investment grade.","During the quarter, we completed a secured 5-year $325 million debt transaction at a fixed interest rate of 2.3%. We have $500 million in securitized notes that mature in April 2012. With the financing noted above, in addition to a $500 million 10-year unsecured debt transaction completed in the third quarter of 2011, we are well positioned to address this maturity.","Now I'd like to take a few moments to step back from the quarterly and annual performance to discuss our business model as we go forward.","To do this, I'd like to refer you to the slides that we've made available on our website in the Investor Relations section at nordstrom.com.","Referencing the slide entitled, \"Investing for Growth.\" It reinforces our overarching goals of sustainable top line growth and mid-teens ROIC as drivers of value creation. This is consistent with what we've shared with you over the past year. Historically, we built value from improved operating disciplines and efficiencies, technology tools and physical store growth. As we continue to drive growth at an accelerated pace in e-commerce, we expect that this model will evolve. E-commerce investments are expected to generate high-dollar growth in sales and EBIT, as opposed to EBIT margin, supported by a highly productive capital base.","We believe that our business model will shift to a blend of these approaches as the majority of our growth comes from e-commerce, while the vast majority of our sales will come from brick and mortar.","With that, I'll now turn your attention to comments on our capital plan. From a capital allocation standpoint, we're planning for $480 million to $520 million in net capital expenditures in 2012, with depreciation and amortization of approximately $370 million for the full year. It represents an increase relative to 2011 with a greater emphasis in e-commerce.","In 2012, we plan to spend over $140 million in e-commerce, representing approximately 30% of our capital expenditures, compared to spend of almost $100 million or approximately 20% last year.","We plan to open 1 full-line store and 15 Rack stores this year, along with a greater number of store remodels.","Our current 5-year capital plan is approximately $3.3 billion. About 60% of our plan is for new stores and remodels. Approximately 30% will fund e-commerce growth, which is double the amount we had in our 5-year plan last year.","Now I will focus on the 2012 guidance, which is provided based on a 53-week fiscal year."," "," We expect to achieve 2012 earnings per share of between $3.30 and $3.45, with same-store sales between 4% to 6%. As has been our practice, these expected results align with our operating plans, reflecting the investments we are making and appropriate sales expectation. This plan would deliver our third straight year of increasing sales by over $1 billion.","Our plan for the 53rd week will increase our annual sales and earnings per share by approximately $160 million to $170 million and between $0.03 and $0.05, respectively.","Our 2012 gross profit rate will range from 5 to 35 basis points lower than last year. This primarily is a function of the near-record performance of merchandise margin in 2011, along with the unfavorable gross profit impact from an increasing mix of Rack stores, the reduction of shipping revenue and the introduction of our enhanced Fashion Rewards program.","We anticipate retail SG&A to be $265 million to $330 million higher than last year. The increase primarily is due to the growth in volume from existing and new stores, along with the previous-mentioned acceleration in e-commerce investments.","Credit card revenue is expected to be flat to up $10 million with no anticipated growth in credit card receivables due to increased sales volume being offset by higher payment rates. Our credit SG&A expense is expected to be $10 million to $20 million higher compared to last year primarily due to the absence of planned reductions in our reserve for bad debt.","EBIT as a percent of sales is planned to be in the range of 11.4% to 11.6% for the year. This is a slight decrease from last year and is a function of the increased level of investments we've described.","Interest expense is anticipated to increase $25 million to $30 million, largely due to increased borrowings and a higher interest rate relative to last year.","Free cash flow is planned to be approximately $400 million for 2012. This reflects our continued ability to generate cash from operations and adequately fund our aggressive growth plan."," "," As we've stated in the past, the highest and best use of our cash is to invest profitably in our business. Beyond that, while maintaining adequate liquidity and flexibility, we look to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, of which $310 million remains in our existing authorization.","In 2012, we will include in our quarterly earnings reporting a breakout of same-store sales for Nordstrom full-line stores, Nordstrom Rack and Direct. This is a change from the last several years in which we reported full-line and Direct comp sales on a combined basis due to the substantial integration between these 2 channels. We continue to believe this is an accurate means of capturing the synergy between these 2 businesses. However, given the incremental investments we are making in our Direct business, greater transparency regarding this part of our business is warranted.","As you can tell from our remarks, we are excited about the strength of our core business, the growth opportunities that lie ahead and the health of our financial position. Overall, we believe this supports our relentless desire to offer superior customer experience and increase shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I look at your slide that you put on your website, it looks like you're anticipating EBIT dollar growth of high single digits in 2012 and then low double digits in the out years. Should we interpret that as thinking about your investment cycle as 2012 being a peak year in terms of dollar commitment and  also SG&A compression?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Charles. This is Mike. Thanks for your question. I think, based on what we know today, 2012 is a pretty significant step change for us relative to building up our capabilities and a number of initiatives in the Direct channel. We also believe that, going forward, we're going to get more leverage out of the top line, that's going to help that. Now keep in mind what this does also say is that we're going to continue to grow the return on invested capital, and that is our focus along with the top line sales growth. Thank you.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I can just sneak one more in, just on the upcoming technology initiatives, can you shed a little light on exactly what you guys are going to be doing? And I know you've been testing geofencing in some of your stores. Can you elaborate on that initiative?","James F. Nordstrom","Yes, this is Jamie. I can't speak directly to the geofencing. I can tell you a number of the things that we're doing are around the mobile space. We've got a number of different initiatives to improve the service we're giving through mobile devices both in our stores and outside the store. We're improving the speed and quality at which we can get merchandise to customers. We think we've got a big opportunity there. A lot of the tools and, frankly, the talent we need to be able to  improve the service we're giving through our online efforts are some of the things we're investing in this year.","Michael G. Koppel","Charles, I, this is Mike, I'll just add one other thing that's very important. And that's the work we're doing in planning and allocation, which is something we've been working on several years, and this is the year we're going to start to implement those technologies.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit -- I think you highlighted the e-commerce piece of the CapEx as being roughly $140 million, but you also cited some of these investments as being one of the reasons for a kind of down EBIT margin on a year-over-year basis. How much of that investment are you actually expensing through the P&L versus capitalizing?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, Ed, overall, you can count that there's, for roughly every $1 of capital that goes into technology, there's roughly 30% to 40% that hits the P&L in that current year. So as we've talked about in the past, when we accelerate these technology investments, it is a more rapid reflection in the P&L but then, long term, does reflect a more proficient capital base.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And one follow-up, if I may. I just want to confirm that your higher interest expense is a result of the debt raise that you did and there's kind of no other reasons for that.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, primarily, that's it.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black","I wondered if you could talk about conversion now that you've had free shipping for a quarter. What are you seeing with the average order size? And do you find most people are shopping multiple departments due to the time-saving nature as far as shopping those departments in-store? And then I also wondered, is the information you're obtaining helping you to be more accurate in your planning and allocation for merchandise in your full-line stores?","James F. Nordstrom","Jennifer, it's Jamie. Yes, I think we've talked about the last couple  quarters since we've launched free shipping that we've seen improvements in just about every customer metric we have that we can measure online. Conversion is up, as you would expect it to be. And we also look at things like average order size and units per order and cross-shopping across the website. And clearly, our free shipping offer has helped, and customers have been telling us through their purchases that they really enjoy having that offering. I couldn't tell you much about cross-shopping; those are things that we don't talk about publicly, but I can tell you that we're seeing great customer behavior, and they like it. As far as the planning and allocation, maybe, Pete, do you want to take that one?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, I think it's been part of our ongoing initiative that we want to have better, more actionable information and particularly given the fact that we've been able to have more fission towards the speed of our term [ph], it means it's more important that we can allocate appropriately and correctly upfront. So we've got access to better information. I think we have a good sense of where the sales are coming from and therefore where the inventory needs to be. So there's a lot of effort being made to make sure we're getting inventory in the right place upfront. So that should continue to help improve our results as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Given your focus on e-commerce, can you talk a little bit about longer-term store count goals for both the full-line and the Rack concept?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Sure, this is Erik. For full-line stores, we're at 117 right now, and we think there's an opportunity around 125 in the United States. So our store count, new store count is dropping. We have 1 new store planned for this year and a couple stores in the workout -- works after that without a affirmed date attached to it. So that is slowing down. For the Rack, we continue to be in at around 15 stores a year. We have a much shorter window with Rack planning so we don't have to commit as far in advance. So for the foreseeable future, we're comfortable with that range.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then any thoughts on expanding into Canada?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Do you want me to?","Michael G. Koppel","Go ahead.","Erik B. Nordstrom","Okay. We've been looking at Canada for over a year now. And it is an attractive market for us. We like it for several reasons. It's -- we have a lot of customers there being as close as we are to the border and the markets are very attractive. It's a very healthy retail environment there. The challenge, as you can probably guess, is the real estate. It's a tough real estate market given the, mainly, the dense urban areas where the population is. So we have an interest in there and we think we could learn a lot that could inform us for other expansion after that, but right now, it's really a real estate question. And at this point, we haven't answered that one.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Lejuez from Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind your comp assumption for '12 just in terms of transactions versus ticket and I then, I guess, most specifically, your AUR assumption for next year?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Paul, this is Mike. We usually don't break out those factors in terms of how we come up with our forward-looking numbers. But I will share with you that, in general, we planned our stores, meaning both the full-line and Rack, in the 3% to 4% increase range, and the balance was in our Direct business. And that's how we came up to the 4% to 6% range.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And how should we think about inventory throughout the year in terms of year-over-year increase?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, it's, this is Pete, I think it's our ongoing quest to make sure that we're trying to grow sales faster than we're growing inventory. That's what you've seen with our improving turns, and our ability to be able to leverage all of these channels off one base of inventory enables us to do that, again, with better information. So I think you should expect to see us try to continue up with those efficiencies and have sales grow faster than inventory. That's how we're planning it.","Operator","Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Could you talk about HauteLook in some detail? What was the drag on earnings actually last year? What is the projected drag on earnings this year? And then, could you just give me also some more specifics on what will the new planning and allocation system do that the system you have now doesn't do?","Michael G. Koppel","Okay, Barbara, this is Mike. Regarding HauteLook, the overall impact on the year was roughly $0.23. I think, when we went into the year, we estimated roughly $0.20. As far as next year, it will be roughly half of that in terms of the impact to the P&L. We expect the company to continue to grow. And we're looking at repeating that roughly 60% growth rate in 2012. And we're going to continue to invest in that business and, hopefully, over the next few years, see some more profitability there.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And the planning and allocation?","Michael G. Koppel","And the second part of the question in terms of the planning and allocation, I think the biggest advantage there is we're going to use the data that we have been accumulating through our multiple channels to develop better ways to allocate and assort our inventory plans on a store level. Currently, we're doing a lot of that with a lot of manual tools and, I think, some data tools and we're going to be able to use some technology to more efficiently help us do that through our purchase order system.","Operator","Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Caris & Company.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, just 2 questions, 1 on the Rack business. You saw some really strong performance throughout much of the year, a little bit more muted in the fourth quarter so I wondered if you could address that. And then just secondly, if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're planning in terms of the mobile PS -- POS unit.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Dorothy, this is Blake. I'll address the Rack. We were really pleased with the team's efforts this last year not only with successfully opening all those new stores but continuing to grow the comp, and there were a number of initiatives on that. It is true that, though there was about a 6- or 7-month trend of pretty consistent comps and it's softened slightly in the fourth quarter, some of that was due to a pretty strong promotion that happened a year before in the month of December that we didn't  anniversary. So we still had gains through it, but it muted that performance a little bit. But we're encouraged about that team and its contribution to the company and expect that through 2012.","Erik B. Nordstrom","This is Erik. On the mobile POS devices, we started about halfway through last year with  about 6,000 devices in all of our full-line stores and that includes some testing in the Rack stores as well. We've had a very strong response to them. Our plan for this year is to continue to increase the functionality of those devices. Currently, about 75% of what our fixed point-of-sale devices can do, we can do on a mobile device. By the end of the year, that'll be 100%. And we will increase the number of these devices both in the full-line stores and in the Rack. So we believe more strongly today that those devices just help provide a better customer experience especially around personalization and speed.","Operator","Our next question is from Michelle Clark from Morgan Stanley.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, I had a question for you. Earlier in the Q&A section, you said that you had expected to get more leverage out of the top line. Can you just remind us where you are in your leverage points today in your buying and occupancy and SG&A and then how we should think about those leverage points go forward?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, well, in terms of our leverage points, right now, particularly the period we're going through, we're much more focused again on driving that top line and sustaining and growing the return on capital. Because part of what's going on is we're going through what we believe is a real, I would say, an incremental step-up in terms of the activity in the investment to take advantage of this e-commerce growth channel that we're seeing. And so it's tough right now because we really don't have a stable point of view and a stable model in terms of where that's settling down and so we believe that the continued investment and being there where our customer wants to be in the moment is the more important thing. And we're going to continue to invest in that.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So a housekeeping question is going to be on just the change in reporting. So I hear what you're saying about the comp on full-line Rack versus Direct. Have you guys done anything internally to actually change the way that you compensate your people, since competition is kind of a big deal? And the big picture question is, you guys are definitely testing around some fun stuff over in St. Louis and Nashville in terms of store formats and flows. Just wondering, what are you learning in those new formats? How do you plan on applying some of those learnings? And give us a sense as to what that could do maybe to the remodels, and how many remodels? That'd be helpful.","Michael G. Koppel","Okay, Neely, this is Mike. In terms of the compensation, we haven't made any changes to the way our folks are compensated as a result of where the sales are going in the various channels we're selling.","Erik B. Nordstrom","As for the new stores, our new stores this last year performed -- they've done well, ahead of our plans. And they're, like all of our new stores, we apply learnings as we go along and they're all a bit different. I think the stores last year all had more of  an integrated women's  apparel area that were less  department divisions that flowed, I think, a little better. And we've had good response to that, a little better women's apparel business as a percent of our total. We're certainly investing in remodels. We think there's  big opportunity there. We've seen particularly good results when we've invested in our flagship stores, our biggest, best stores where we can invest. And often, a big part of that investment is expanding our Designer offering. To have a full Designer offer with an enhanced environment in our best locations where there's a lot of customers, a lot of tourism, has really paid off for us so we will continue to focus on those areas in particular.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Drbul from Barclays Capital.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, when you look at the '13 and '14 targets on the EBIT dollars, as you put in the chart, what are the profitability assumptions around the e-commerce piece of the business in the low double-digit growth that you're targeting for those out year?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, Bob, this is Mike. We haven't really disclosed individual profit goals for the business. And I think an important part of that too is it's not just about the profit that comes from e-commerce; it's the overall value that we create for our customers through all channels and so it's tough to look at that in a silo and make some sort of assumption about that. So we're really not breaking it out. We'd like to think of this as the combined and collective offering.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then just my second question, if I could, Mike. On the inventory, the levels of the inventory, are there any pockets of inventory you guys are concerned about as you look to the beginning of this year?","Michael G. Koppel","No, Bob, the answer's no. We feel that we transitioned out of the fourth quarter very well. We did what we needed to do to assure that going into the spring. We had current and healthy inventories. Some of the growth you're seeing is reflective of the continued growth in the assortment in the online business, as well as anticipated volume levels that we anticipated in the month of February.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just  along those same lines with the inventory, obviously, you've got industry-leading turns. I'd assume, as e-commerce grows, that would make turns go even faster. But maybe I don't understand it or maybe there are different things about the business as it grows that would maybe not make it turn as fast, right?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I think, in general, it's made it go faster because we have a shared inventory that we've used so we're just -- it's more efficient. What's going to change, though, is as we work to do a better job of gaining top line, that's going to probably imply us having some more offer and selection online, and we've got to invest in that. And I think there's going to be a period of time when we  really understand how that inventory works for us. So we're trying to gauge how far we can go in terms of the breadth of our offer online and still have it be efficient.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So I guess, short term, it's accretive, but long term, maybe neutral.","Michael G. Koppel","I -- we have to learn. I mean, this is a -- in the scheme of the life of this channel, we're in very early stages. And I think we have a lot to learn about how to do that. But all that being said, it's that we see it as a significant growth opportunity, and we'll fund it appropriately.","Operator","Our next question is from Deborah Weinswig from Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So 2 questions. Number one, Blake, in your prepared comments, you spoke about expanding your online merchandise selection. Well, does that mean your online offering will differ  from what's in stores?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Deborah, we just talked about it in the previous question and both Pete was talking about it, and Mike, a little bit. I think we prided ourself as merchants to try to have an edited buy, a balanced buy within the confines of our customer demand in the store and space constraints and flow and a number of issues. And so as we've applied that from kind of our roots to online, to date, that's served us pretty well. But as we continue to listen to our customer, they're expecting and demanding even more selection and they want that search engine to be that efficient means to quickly go to the item or items that they're hoping to have. So that means more SKUs for us. And whether that's leveraging what we have in our stores, whether that's our facility at Cedar Rapids or, down the road, the possibility of another facility, whether that's drop ship, we have to execute on what the customer is looking for. And we think, at this point, selection is really important online. And so as Mike said, we're on a steep learning curve there. We're going after it, and we expect to succeed there.","Peter E. Nordstrom","I will just say to add, this is Pete, that we would -- you would expect to find the same brands and classifications but we might be able to go with more selection in those brands than we could typically offer in a store, so the selection will grow in some regard.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on January 20, I think it was announced that Obama was easing the Visa rules to boost U.S. tourism. Obviously, with the -- as you mentioned, you were kind of increasing your kind of Designer merchandise selections and obviously have a lot of stores on the West Coast that could easily benefit from this. Can you talk about if you've incorporated anything of that into your comp estimates for 2012? And how you're thinking about that in terms of your merchandise selections?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, Deborah, we have not assumed anything in our comps as it relates to that change. Hopefully, we'll get some benefit, but we didn't bake anything in.","Operator","Our next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess -- I've so many questions, but I'll start with, what's -- can you give us an update on women's? After the departure of Loretta Soffe, sort of what's going on with that business? And then I thought you said that the capital plan was $3.3 billion for over 5 years, which if you just straight-line it, is a little bit more than the CapEx that you've guided to for 2012. So could you just help reconcile that?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. With regards to women's, yes, it's been a challenging year for us. And that has prompted some changes, as you mentioned, with our leadership there. I think that we expect that we should be able to do better and we should be able to do better right away. There's a lot of things we've tried this last year both related to what we're carrying and how we merchandise it in the stores. And I think we're getting  to a place where we're able to draw some conclusions from that, that we can apply across more stores and, obviously, in the spirit of being able to grow the business. So I don't really have anything to announce there right now other than, clearly, we weren't satisfied with the results we had so we're making changes to improve those results.","Michael G. Koppel","And Liz, this is Mike, regarding your question on the $3.3 billion plan, included in that plan, in the tail end of those 5 years is roughly $600 million that relates to potential opportunities in the Canada market as well as Manhattan.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question. We've talked -- you've talked a lot about return on invested capital in your long-term objectives. Could you talk about how you guys internally view HauteLook, if you're holding them to the same ROIC standards as you hold the other divisions? Or is it really a Skunk works kind of operation where you're using it as a test and learning experience rather than an ROIC-driven kind of investment?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Richard. This is Mike. I mean, our goal is that we want to grow businesses to create value. And I think, clearly, we took a high risk by going into an early-stage business that tends not to have the same kind of operating metrics as more mature businesses do. Long term, we do have those kind of expectations. We also believe it's going to create value, return value for the greater enterprise. So that being said, the learnings we're getting from it and the accelerated top line growth we're getting, we hope that, over time, will help us deliver the kind of return goals we have.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you think 2012 is going to be another year where we see accessories continue to outperform apparel? And could you talk a little bit about the trends that you saw for boots over the holidays? We've heard that prices on some brands are going to be going up fairly substantially for next year. Do you think that can continue and we can continue to see nice increases in units there?","Peter E. Nordstrom","What -- with regards to the question on accessories, we've had -- I mean, I don't know how many years in a row we've had kind of outpaced growth there, but it's been several. So I certainly don't see anything in the business that would indicate that, that's slowing down. We've got good traction in those classifications. We have good leadership and  good merchandising strategies. And our plans are that we will continue to grow that business at least fast, if not faster, than the rest of the total business and as it all rolls up. The other question was about boots, specifically. We had a great boot season this last year. I mean, our shoe division just had a really excellent year  kind of across the board and, in large part, because they planned well around the demand for boots, not only in the fourth quarter, but really kind of all throughout the year as it applied across fashion. And I think that, that will continue to evolve, but for us, that meant we had some average higher unit retail prices and that, that worked out well for us. But I don't think it's fair to assume that, that will continue to go an upward trajectory. I know that our group is really looking at other ways to tap into new growing markets. So I don't think there's going to be a big seismic shift away from boots to something else, but I think that should probably flatten out some and we'll see other categories emerge that we can grow with.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up. What was the gross margin impact from free shipping in Q4?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, we didn't really comment, but it's been, and we said in Q3, roughly 10 to 15 basis points to the total company.","Operator","And our final question today is from Michael Exstein from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple  quick points of clarification. Number one, when you talked about the loss from HauteLook, that is not an incremental $0.10, $0.12 or $0.15 but a reduction year-over-year...","Michael G. Koppel","That's correct. That's correct, Michael.","Michael Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then in terms of, how come depreciation is sort of growing at a lower percentage rate than CapEx this year?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, because it's still catching up to the CapEx rate. The growth this year and the way, Michael, that the CapEx is coming on the books is just the relative timing of when that's happening. To assume that all that capital is going to come on in the first day is probably not likely. Thank you.","Robert Campbell","Thank you for joining us today for our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call.

You may begin.","Trina Schurman","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include a 30 minutes for your questions.

Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, Co-President.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Erik.","Erik Nordstrom","Thanks Trina. Good afternoon. Before we get into the call, I'd like to take a moment to comment on Blake's passing. As you can imagine, this has been a painful and difficult time for our family and our Company. Blake's impact around here is immeasurable.","He loved this business and was so good at it. I think the most important impact Blake had on our Company was with our people. In many ways, he brought our culture and values to life. He was the most genuine person I have ever known, and his authenticity helped him make real connections with people inside and outside of our company, many of you included.","Pete, Blake and I worked closely as a team our entire lives, most especially over the last 20 years and most recently as Co-Presidents. We miss Blake terribly but are inspired by his example, and all of us are committed to keeping his legacy alive by being the best retailer we can be, particularly me and Pete. Lastly, Pete and I would like to thank those of you who have reached out with your condolences and stories about Blake. It is greatly appreciated.","Okay. I\u2019d like to start out by saying that we are confident in our strategy to serve customers and drive market share gains. Our unique business model is a key point of difference. It allows us to serve customers in multiple ways \u2013 through Stores, Online, Full-Price, and Off-Price with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. Heading into 2019, we\u2019re focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience.","While we have the right strategies in place, we are not satisfied with our current financial results. We planned 2018 as the inflection point for improved profitability, and we missed this objective. We have a high sense of urgency to deliver on our profit margin expectations. This means executing our levers to drive our top and bottom line. We\u2019re focused on getting back on track with our profitability goals, and we reaffirm our financial targets that we laid out during Investor Day last July.","Turning now to our fourth quarter results, we had a slightly positive comp sales increase driven by momentum in Off-Price. In Full-Price, we saw an unexpected slowdown in full-line store traffic, during and after the holidays. This resulted in softness across most merchandise categories, with Women\u2019s Apparel being the most challenging. We\u2019re taking immediate action to improve our merchandise assortment by leveraging data analytics for inventory and allocation planning.","At Investor Day, we outlined a number of initiatives supporting our customer strategy. First, we\u2019re encouraged by our customer trends. Of our 35 million customers, nearly 10 million shopped across our multiple channels over the past year. We expect this to lead to incremental customer spend of 4x to 11x. During 2018, more than 7 million new customers were introduced to Nordstrom through our Off-Price business, our largest source of customer acquisition. This is impactful because one-third of these customers are expected to cross-shop in our Full-Price business within a year.","Second, our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales made up 30% of our business in 2018. As we shared during Investor Day, Nordstrom.com has achieved scale with contribution margins at parity with full-line stores. Customers are increasingly engaging with us across stores and online. As an example, we\u2019ve seen annualized sales growth of 40% from buy online, pick-up in-store over the past five years.","Third, we continue to leverage our strategic brand partnerships to offer customers newness and a sense of discovery. These partnerships include emerging brands such as Reformation and Something Navy, as well as established partners like La Mer and Birkenstock. We also had successful limited-time launches of digitally native brands like Away and Allbirds, with more coming this year. Our strategic brands delivered growth of 9% and made up more than 40% of our Full-Price sales.","Finally, we\u2019re pleased with our team\u2019s execution in Off-Price to build momentum over the past year. Through focused efforts to strengthen our merchandise offering, we delivered improved topline trends and faster inventory turns. We continued our expansion into Canada with the introduction of six Nordstrom Rack stores that have outperformed our expectations.","Similar to our U.S. business, we\u2019ve already seen synergies between Nordstrom and Rack stores. For example, the Rack serves as an exhaust for full-line stores, enabling more newness and improving product margin in Canada. This year, we have two key priorities to drive sales and market share gains \u2013 our local market strategy and The Nordy Club loyalty program.","Beginning with our local market strategy, we\u2019re leveraging inventory, along with digital and store capabilities, to serve customers in new and relevant ways. We launched this strategy in Los Angeles as a proof of concept. The outsized share gains in this market give us confidence as we continue to scale.","Our \u201cGet It Fast\u201d feature offers customers an expanded selection of merchandise available next day. We also opened two more Nordstrom Local neighborhood hubs. We\u2019re experiencing higher customer engagement through services such as alterations and personal styling, which lead to an exponential lift in customer spend.","In the L.A. market, demand for buy online, pick-up in-store increased by 4x. Customers who visit Nordstrom Local spend 2.5x more on average. This year we\u2019re planning to reach scale in L.A. by leveraging our inventory. Our supply chain investments will give customers greater access to merchandise selection, with faster delivery, and at a lower cost to us.","This spring, we plan to open a local omni-channel hub in L.A. to accelerate inventory efficiencies. We also plan to open a 1 million square-foot supply chain facility in the fall. This will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base.","We\u2019re looking forward to expanding our presence in New York City. We introduced our men\u2019s store last spring and plan to open our women\u2019s store this October. This flagship will be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand, in one of the world\u2019s top retail markets. We expect that our flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in the New York City market.","Our second key priority is to leverage our loyalty program. We continue to evolve our program to remain relevant with customers. In 2018, our loyalty customers contributed more than half of our sales. Last fall, we launched our enhanced program, The Nordy Club. Card members are now earning three points \u2013 up from two \u2013 for every dollar they spend.","We also added experiential elements, such as exclusive access to services and experiences. For example, we offered our loyalty customers early access to our recent Something Navy drop. Going forward, we are pursuing additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend.","In closing, we\u2019re well-positioned for success through our unique business model that enables us to serve customers in differentiated ways. As we focus on delivering our profitability goals this year, we\u2019re prepared to take further action to drive our top and bottom line.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our results and expectations for 2019.","Anne Bramman","Thank you, Erik. To reiterate, we\u2019re disappointed that we missed our EBIT margin inflection point in 2018. We\u2019re focused on getting back on track through our levers around inventory and expense. As we approach the end of our heavy investment cycle this year, we expect our generational investments and digital capabilities to further scale and contribute to improved profitability. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to remain agile in changing business conditions.","Turning to our fourth quarter performance from an EBIT perspective, our results were generally consistent with our updated expectations in our holiday preannouncement. While Full-Price sales came in lower than expected, this was offset by strong expense management. Full-Price comp sales decreased 1.6%.","As Erik mentioned, we saw broad-based declines across most merchandise categories, with the exception of Shoes. To address our opportunities going forward, we took immediate action to edit our assortment, which represented about 10% of our brand portfolio. In Off-Price, our comp sales increase of 4% was in line with expectations, with gains across most divisions. This reflected successful efforts throughout the year to improve our merchandise assortment and accelerate inventory turns.","Our total company gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points over last year. We took higher markdowns due to softer Full-Price trends and in response to an elevated promotional environment. We ended the year in a solid inventory position overall, with a decrease of approximately 2.5%. That said, we have some pockets of elevated levels based on our current sales trends.","Our SG&A rate was down 23 basis points over last year. We managed expenses well, outperforming our expectations. We continued to bend the curve as our annual expense growth moderated to 4%, below the five-year historical average of 7%. This was driven by productivity gains in our digital capabilities particularly in marketing and technology.","Our fourth quarter earnings also reflected a favorable income tax impact associated with our deferred tax assets. This included a $0.05 EPS benefit related to prior periods, in addition to a reduced effective tax rate beginning in 2018. As we look back on the year, our strong financial position is a key differentiator in the marketplace. We have a healthy balance sheet and generated annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year.","Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enabled us to return $1 billion to shareholders during the year and maintain an investment grade credit rating. As we shared during Investor Day, we are targeting increased shareholder returns through the following financial priorities: drive market share gains; improve profitability and returns; and continue our disciplined capital allocation approach. We\u2019re focused on achieving our long-term financial targets and in fact, sales, ROIC, and free cash flow performed in line with our goals.","While we fell short of our EBIT margin expectations in 2018, we\u2019re confident that we can achieve our long-term targets. We\u2019re focused on scaling our generational investments, leveraging our digital capabilities, and strengthening our product margin. Inventory is our biggest near-term lever of profitability.","We\u2019ve positioned our inventory plans below our sales trends, giving us flexibility to chase demand. We\u2019re also further leveraging data analytics to inform our merchandise levels and allocation. Our second lever of improved profitability is expense. Relative to our long-term targets, we are planning incremental savings between $150 million to $200 million related to efficiency initiatives across our company.","Turning to our 2019 guidance, our EPS range of $3.65 to $3.90 is based on net sales growth of 1% to 2%. This assumes consistent trends in Off-Price and gradual improvement in Full-Price throughout the year. As we have mentioned before, we\u2019re measuring success through sales, customer, and market metrics.","In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comps due to the ongoing shift from stores to digital. As a result, beginning this year we will only report net sales growth. For EBIT, we expect a range of $915 to $970 million. This implies an EBIT margin range of 5.9% to 6.1%, tracking toward our 2020 goal of 6.3% to 6.5%.","Relative to our long-term targets, we have assumed lower sales growth in 2019 offset by incremental expense initiatives. From a gross profit perspective, we\u2019re planning modest expansion through efforts to increase inventory turns and grow strategic brands. Our occupancy rate is expected to be flat.","Moving to SG&A, we\u2019re planning for modest deleverage when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. This includes $150 million to $200 million of expense savings and ongoing productivity gains in our digital capabilities. Excluding our West Coast supply chain investments, we expect to maintain a mid-single-digit expense growth for digital capabilities.","Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. In 2018, they contributed nearly $2 billion to our topline and exceeded our bottom line expectations. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook became our fastest business to hit $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club sales grew 35% for the year, on track to reach its market potential of more than $500 million.","In 2019, we\u2019re planning for our generational investments to deliver sales of roughly $2.2 billion, with an EBIT improvement of approximately $15 million over last year. In terms of our quarterly cadence, we expect EBIT for the first quarter to decrease from the prior year. This assumes a continuation of current sales trends with higher markdowns to clear out pockets of excess inventory.","From an expense standpoint, we assume greater deleverage on fixed expenses resulting from lower volume in the first quarter relative to the year. We\u2019re planning for EBIT margin to leverage beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we estimate $35 million in pre-opening costs for our New York flagship leading up to our planned October opening.","From a CapEx perspective, there are no material changes to our 5-year plan. We\u2019re estimating approximately $900 million of investments in 2019, or nearly 6% of sales. This includes a shift of around $100 million in projects from last year. We\u2019re investing in our key priorities, with 50% of our plan for technology and supply chain and 30% for the New York flagship. As we near the end of our generational investments cycle, we expect CapEx levels to moderate in 2020. ","Through our unique business model and strong financial position, we believe we have the appropriate plans in place to succeed. Together, as an experienced team, we\u2019re prepared to make hard choices and pull additional levers around inventory and expenses to drive improvement in our business. Heading into 2019, we\u2019re focused on delivering our profitability expecations and long-term financial targets.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we would appreciate it if you can limit to one question to allow everyone a chance to ask a question. We'll now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jay Sole of UBS. Please proceed.","Jay Sole","Great, thank you. Anne, my question is about the margin guidance. It\u2019s interesting that you're guiding to sales up 1% to 2%, yet you're still able to increase the EBIT margin. Is the message that you're seeing investments payoff, the generational investments and you're able to do things around inventory or is it more that sales are a little bit slower and you're finding new places to sort of cut costs and maybe you didn't expect before? And if you could sort of maybe divide between the two where the margin improvement is coming from that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes. Thanks Jay, and I appreciate your question. So I think let's step back and broadly look at how we set the plan for 2019 and where we set our guidance. So as you mentioned the topline of 1% to 2%. I think if you\u2019re focusing on the \u2013 I'm going to talk about the midpoint of our guidance. As you can see from the midpoint of our guidance, we are actually expecting to get inflection in EBIT rate. And the way we're getting there is modest improvement in our margins through inventory turns, tighter discipline in inventory and strategic partnerships.","On the SG&A side, it's a slight deleverage, but between the two, they kind of moderate out. So what you're seeing is flow through from the topline. I would emphasize, on the SG&A piece to it. It's kind of a combination of both. We are getting a lot more leverage both in the topline and the flow through from our generational investments. We're getting scale and productivity out of the investments we've been making in our digital capabilities. And additionally, we are finding additional ways to drive productivity in the organization.","In general, when I look at our SG&A rate as we're coming out of our heavy investment cycles, the good news is if you pull out what we're investing in our West Coast supply chain, our SG&A rate would be relatively flat from a rate basis year-over-year. So we're really starting to see that scale and productivity coming through the business.","Jay Sole","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [Rossi] on for Alex. We just want to know what is embedded in your guidance as far as freight and wages, particularly on the fulfillment? And also if you could give a little bit more color on the digital capabilities planned for 2019? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes. So Alex, I'll take the first piece of the wage and freight. We typically don't break that in the model. What I would say is as you're hearing from everybody in the market, there is wage inflation and freight costs are going up. However, as part of our guidance, we're finding ways to offset that.","Again, we've been making investments in things like the supply chain and West Coast. So that's actually helping us not only serve our customers in a better way, but it's also allowing us to open up inventory and also be more cost efficient in how we serve the customer. So we're finding ways to offset some of those increases. From a digital capability perspective, Erik talked about supply chain in his remarks. Erik, do you want to add anything else to the capability?","Erik Nordstrom","Yes. I\u2019ll touch on that. I would start with inventory, being able to leverage the inventory that we have that's close to our customers, mainly in our stores, but also starting this year with the local omnichannel hub, and I mentioned in LA, allows us to do a lot with customers then it \u2013 so it's the digital investments to leverage that inventory. It's also the digital investments allow the customer to access it the inventory in very efficient way.","So the result of that is a significant increase in selection for the customer. And when we executed with our local market strategy, especially same day, next day, two day, the amount of selection we can bring to customer is significant. The speed increases dramatically as well. Right now our two fulfillment centers, one is an Iowa, one is in Pennsylvania. Our delivery time to our West Coast customers, will improve significantly.","And the third thing that our digital investments around inventory provide us \u2013 for us at a much lower cost. We're able to get this increased selection faster and at a lower cost. So it's a very meaningful. The other part, our digital capabilities, I would lump them together as being able to serve customers better.","And a lot of that has to do with stitching together these experiences, digital experiences we've invested in the last several years. A lot of these capabilities we've tested and we know, they resonate with customers, but they especially are meaningful to the business when we can connect them together.","So it can be \u2013 I guess old world services like alterations of making that experience and setting up appointments online. That's an important piece of engagement for us and our digital investments help with that.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Oliver Chen with Cowen. Please proceed.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. It was very helpful in the comments regarding the women's product and that being more challenging. What's your hypothesis for what happened there and what classifications or thoughts do you have? It sounded like you could use data to help better inform the inventory bias. Just would love your thoughts on how that process will work and the timing of working through these pockets of elevated levels? Thank you.","Pete Nordstrom","Yes. Hi, Oliver, this is Pete. So yes, it was a bit abrupt in terms of what happened in women's and somewhat unusual that had happened pretty much across the Board. And there's explanations for all, but if you really kind of get into it, it is troubling that we had that challenge across the Board.","So the thing that we've got going for us, to your point about the data analytics, we've got really good information about what's working, what's not. And so we\u2019re actually right in the middle of understanding better just things like our average unit retail and some what's happening in the different classifications. So the first thing we did is we had to take our inventory levels down, so that we weren't taking too many markdowns and as such, we edit it out. It's about 10% of the brands that we offer in women. So part of that gets us rightsized, and the other part of that that does creates some Open-To-Buy for us to go and buy new things that hopefully are going to be more compelling.","And I think we tend to always gravitate. We've been doing this a long time, we're in the fashion business like, if it's not working it's probably because our offers is not compelling enough. And I know that sounds kind of obvious, but we've got a team of people that are currently in market right now just trying to figure out a way to improve our offer. There were some things that worked well in women's. As an example, like our Topshop business is really strong still. So there maybe some things to learn about that. I mean that would suggest to us that new product, fashion product, maybe a price sensibility. I think some indicators there that should help us as we continue to work through this.","Anne Bramman","I'll take the question on the timing. So as we talked about our Q1 guidance, part of this is getting through some of the pockets of excess inventory. As I mentioned in my comments in the script, we've been placing our buy below our sales trend in order to allow ourselves the ability to be agile and to chase demand. So we're expecting that we'll be able to come out of Q1 really having to address some of these pockets of inventory.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Very helpful. Best regards.","Anne Bramman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the really thoughtful remarks around Blake's passing. My condolences. Could you talk about how you're going to fulfill his responsibilities and how you're reallocating a lot of things he did internally in the organization? And how you are thinking about the management team overall as you continue to go down this digital path and omni-channel path where you think you are on the talent front? Thank you.","Erik Nordstrom","Thanks, Omar. Yes, in many ways the subject aren't new to me and Pete \u2013 some ways they are. We've been co-presidents and have shared responsibilities over a number of years where we had our different areas of focus. So we've done it with Blake's passing, I am supporting finance, still supporting our Full-Price business for both full-line stores, nordstrom.com, and supporting technology. Pete supporting the Off-Price business, marketing, HR, all of our merchandising. Am I forgetting anything?","Pete Nordstrom","That's about it?","Erik Nordstrom","Okay. And I\u2019ll say structure always follow strategy for us and we've moved things around over the years. And again, we've been involved in kind of all the subjects and some of them were more involved now than we were before. To your question about, how you view talent and our team, we really do run the business as a team and it's our executive team that ultimately runs the business for us.","And we've had some additions over the last several years going back, so it's been about 3.5 years. Christine Deputy, in HR; and then Anne, our CFO; and most recently, Edmond Mesrobian, who is our Chief Technology Officer, joined us about seven months ago. I will say the common thread through all of those is going deep in subject matter expertise and adding more specific technical talent to our team, number one. And then number two is how we operate as a team. So I believe we have the best team we've ever had and feeling really confident as we move forward.","Omar Saad","Thanks for sharing your comments.","Erik Nordstrom","Thanks Omar.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Edward Yruma","Hi, thanks for taking my question and my condolences. I know the New York women's flagship is opening this year, later in the year, and I know you gave some color to the shape of the year from a P&L perspective, but are there some things we should consider as you begin to kind of final preparation for opening that from a P&L perspective and kind of how should we think about the lift that you receive from it in the back part of the year? Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Ed, this is Anne. So for the New York store, we gave some commentary as far as the pre-opening expenses as you can imagine with an October opening, you will start seeing this really start to ramp Q2 more importantly Q3 as we go through the year. As far as the color around the year, when we get into the quarter we'll give some more watching as far as and guidance or color of how that market is doing as part of our generational investment. I will say that given the fact that this is opening in the fourth quarter, as you can imagine, it will slightly skew some of our guidance or EBIT delivery and topline delivered to the fourth quarter or the second half of the year versus normal. Not materially but slightly.","Edward Yruma","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks for taking my question and condolences to you and the family. I guess the first question for me is just on the customer centric strategy, you guys have the 10 million consumers that you have that cross shot multiple channels. I think you talked about it growing 6%.","I'm curious, how would that looked over time? You guys have slice and dice the loyalty data little bit different than just trying to see what the kind of growth rate comparability is. And then I guess maybe adding on to Ed's question as it relates to the New York opening, I'm curious if there have been specific learnings more from whether it's merchandising or anything else from the men's store now that it's been open for a while that can help kind of inform things that you would change and as you prepare to open that? Thank you.","Erik Nordstrom","Hi Erin, this is Erik. You brought up the 10 million is cross shopping, then you mentioned loyalty. Those are two different things. So the 10 million is what a shops more than one channel for us with us, but is not limited to loyalty customer. So yes. I will say that cross shop\u2026","Anne Bramman","Yes, please. I guess that do you used to disclose the loyalty members pretty right regularly and you've stopped disclosing that. So we're getting kind of different segmentation of how you think about kind of that customer centric model. So just thinking about that 10 million who kind of cross shops, I'm just \u2013 you talked about it growing 6%. I'm just curious kind of what has that run rate been. The growth of those consumers that are shopping across multiple channels how has that looked over the recent quarters?","Erinn Murphy","I don't have that right in front of me, but my I would say it's been pretty steady that that percentage of migration and what's encouraging to us is that that continues. The as that becomes a bigger, a bigger base, that's more and more people. So we are encouraged about that in. And I would point out we talk about things like the cross shop and digital sales penetration.","Our business is much more digital than even that suggest, we know that the majority of store visits start online. We know that majority of our store customers pull out their phone at some point while they're in our stores. And ultimately that could get captured as a store sale and it wouldn't be capturing that calculation that you're referring to. But it absolutely, is aided by the digital assets that we have.","Pete Nordstrom","And this is Pete. I'll take on the New York part and it is true. We've had a lot of learnings and one of the great advantages we've had is being able to open the men's store and advance the women's store. It did initially start out that that was our plan, but once we knew we were able to open it sooner, we made a decision because we knew we'd be able to get some learnings and when the women's store opened really be able to leverage that. And that's been true. We've been able to prove ourselves that we can hire really nice people that give great service. That's been super positive. We proved that the customers are responding super well to the integrated physical and digital experiences behalf such as express returns and same day delivery and the 24\/7 Buy Online Pick Up in Store.","In fact, a lot of women shoppers are using the men's store as a hub to do returns. We\u2019ve also proven that we get a big online lift in a market when we have a physical store there. The New York market is already on before we open a physical store, our biggest online market. So we know that once the women's store opened, that's going to be great.","The other thing that we confirmed ourselves the synergy of having everything all located next to each other helps. So we\u2019ve planned this, but we've confirmed it that without the women's store opening the men's store while it's doing well and you'll meet our plans and both ways, it's going to be a lot better, when the women's store opened because we just get that lift of that many more customers.","I mean, for example, in our regular Full-Price business, I think it's something that 48% of all things sold in men\u2019s departments, sold to a woman buying it for a man. And it's obviously quite a bit less since we don't have the women's store across the street.","So I think we're feeling super encouraged by that. That the other thing I would tell you is, we've got a reputation, a legacy and a foundational element around shoes. Shoes has been the best performing category in men's. We've got a lot of shoe inventory and square footage plan in women's and kids and everything [indiscernible] new tower. We're feeling really confident about that.","The other thing that we've done in the tower as we've dedicated more inventory and floor space to designer, designers has been the best performing kind of as a price classification in men's. And we anticipate that that's going to carry from women's. So I guess I've used a long way of answers, but I think we've confirmed a lot of things that we knew and were feeling really great about opening up in October.","Trina Schurman","Yes, and Erinn, this is Trina. Just to let you know that we did disclose the loyalty customer. It's $11 million, that's a 16% increase year-over-year, and they contribute about 56% of our sales, and that's on it's like.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you. I appreciate that. Thanks Trina.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, thanks everyone. It's Tracy filling in for Paul. I was just wondering, given the challenges, you saw it full price in the quarter, what were you seeing in the competitive environment and does any of that make you change or we think you're overall promotional playbook? Thanks.","Pete Nordstrom","Yes, this is Pete. That's a really good question. And I think it's a real time issue for us to figure out how to compete more effectively in our promotional environment. And it was promotional, in holiday time in particular. A lot of it is, we've got what we call preferred strategic brands and these are brands that have limited distribution, but all of these brands are retailers as well.","And what things that we've seen is a fair amount of them pulled a promotional trigger there in December. So we were actually having to compete on price with some of these brands that results in terms of their vertical presence as retailers. I think that everyone really is committed in our orbit of \u2013 and universe of brands we work with try to run a full price business, but there's some practical realities that come in there.","So it's evolved and changed over the years from just a straight markdown to things like buy more, save more, and a lot of kind of clever ways of getting promotional activity in there.","So I guess what we could tell you without declaring anything here specifically is that, we've got a lot of really good data about that and we want to make sure that our strategy is as competitive as it can be. And obviously we can't pretend that the promotional thing doesn't exist. So we continue to work on that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, thanks for taking our question. I'll have my condolences. I just want to a couple of modeling questions on Slide 21, that 1Q commentary and does that mean below the full-year guide or below last year? And then also I don't understand the comment that diluted shares will be $162, for fiscal 2019 without buyback considering you printed about 167 and fourth quarter, so just a couple of simple modeling ones there.","Anne Bramman","Yes, thanks for the question, so on the slide, on the Q1 guidance it\u2019s below last year, so again as we talked about it, we're seeing overall guidance for the year is that we would start to slowly get a gradual improvement in the full price trends we saw coming out of Q4.","We have some pockets of inventory that we will go through. So we expect our markdowns to be higher and so that for our product margin would be a little \u2013 will be lower as well year-over-year, because of the topline coming down, we would expect to see deleverage on our fixed SG&A expenses just because you don't have the topline there.","So overall, we would expect Q1 on a comparison compared to last year will be below. As far as to share pieces to what we gave you the guidance based on the \u2013 there's an average versus where we end the year and trying to come work with you offline on reconciling that.","Michael Binetti","Okay, thanks. And I guess if we try to click down a little bit into the full price business and I guess you've diagnosed it that some of the vertical brands maybe, when promotional on you and that could have affected the trend rate in the fourth quarter. If I heard your comments a minute ago were correctly, I'm trying to think why that behavior would change with given so many of the brands are building their own direct-to-consumer businesses today.","What we will cause her behavior to change or this is more of unappreciated comment about things to come that you'll have to be competing with the brands in the stores a little bit more as they build out their own DTC businesses?","Pete Nordstrom","Well, the promotional activity is usually a reflection of some kind of deceleration of sales trends and they find themselves with too much inventory. So for us we're on top of that as best we can be. And we paid the price for a little bit to get ourselves in line, but we start the year in a pretty healthy position with inventory positions, even though we missed our sales plans.","And even as we go forward, we're going to be down about 5% and our plans and receipts, if not more. I mean, we've got to respond to that as time goes on. So I don't know and I think increasingly it strikes us that our relationships with brands, particularly as we become more edited and our offer is much more strategic than it is transactional, and oftentimes we're trying to solve for the same issues.","These guys have big retail initiatives and it doesn't serve them well to run a super promotional business either. I mean, it used to be the biggest cry that they would have if we\u2019re super promotional with the business. So they know it's corrosive to the brand value that they have. So I think the biggest thing is for us to work upfront with brands to be clear about what we see in terms of sales trends, planning the business right, ensuring that we've got good flow. So that's keeping ourselves nimble and agile by having relatively lean inventories.","These have been fundamental practices that we've worked on for years, but it feels like it's coming into sharper focus. And I can just tell you from my personal experience of interacting with the leaders of these different brands we do business with, they are largely very interested in partnering with us in ways that they haven't in the past about how to flow inventory. So it works to our mutual benefit.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.","Charles Grom","Thanks. Good afternoon, Erik, Peter, our thoughts are with you and the team. Anne just a couple for you on the incremental expense savings that you talked about the $150 million to $200 million, just wondering if you could flush out what the impact is to your long-term guide in light of that? And then, my follow-up question would be just we noticed that the number of Rack openings next year is going to be down significantly. I think you guys were outlining five stores versus roughly 17 in the past couple of years. Just wondering why the deceleration. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes. Chuck, let me talk to you a little bit about the SG&A pieces and the incremental. So as far as the overall, our long-term targets, as I mentioned in my comments, when we set the target from our Investor Day last summer, we have had a little bit of \u2013 we took a modest decline to sale. So that\u2019s come down a little bit versus what we had set out was the target. But we have more SG&A productivity savings.","I would expect when you see that coming through for the year, you're going to start seeing that coming through in our SG&A lines in the second quarter, and then really progressing through the rest of the year. So overall it should actually \u2013 we should be in line from an EBIT rate percentage. It's just a few different levers to get there. And I think Pete can talk about the Racks. ","Pete Nordstrom","Yes. There is no big explicit message being sent about the number of stores were Rack stores are opened this next year. Our strategy for a long time is to be strategic there. We don't have as long as the lead time to figure that out and plan it out. And frankly we actually raise the bar on the expectations we have when planning a store in terms of the four wall profitability it needs to deliver. I think just to be cautious kind of giving the environment in terms of what's happening with physical brick and mortar retailing.","But the good news is we've been able to have success really across the board regionally with new Racks are opening. So again, I wouldn't read too much into that. I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic. We believe we can have more Rack stores successfully. And what typically happens in terms of the opportunistic part of it is when times get challenging for others, oftentimes that creates great real estate opportunities for us. So that's what we're taking a hard look at here over the next 12 to 18 months.","Charles Grom","Thank you.","Trina Schurman","We will now take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please proceed.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon, and thanks for squeezing me in and my condolences to the family as well. Anne, how was traffic versus ticket in this past quarter between Full and Off-Price? And then just is there any update to the Analyst Day plan to repurchase? I think it was 3.5 billion to 4 billion of stock or whatever that number was. So just if we can get an update on that. Thank you. ","Anne Bramman","Thanks. So on the traffic versus ticket, I would say generally when we talk about this in Full-Price, we saw a deceleration, pretty substantial deceleration in Q4. And for Off-Price the trends really didn't change. So the biggest call I would have on traffic, is the Q4 for Full-Price. As far as the share buyback, we laid out a plan and I think you saw in Q4, we\u2019re part of that \u2013 that was part of our disciplined capital allocation approach. And we did see an opportunity to get in the market and buyback a lot of stock. So we continued to have approach. We haven't come off our plan. That was a five-year plan. But I think you're seeing that we're executing against that.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the year ahead.","Anne Bramman","Thank you.","Trina Schurman","Again, thank you for joining today's call. A replay, along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks, will be available for one year on our website.

We will begin with the prepared remarks, followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President, and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's second quarter performance and the outlook for fiscal year 2016. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Thank you and good afternoon. Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory, expense, and capital as we align to current sales trends. In the second quarter, the team made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales. We're also pleased with our customers' response to the Anniversary Sale. This year marked one of the best events we've had in our history, with an all-time high in sales volume. The strength of our Anniversary event, along with the team's inventory and expense execution, drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter.","Our Anniversary performance reflected an improvement from our recent sales trends. We had a strong start to the sale and the momentum continued throughout the event. Our sell-through rates were at record highs, putting us in a clean inventory position for the second half of the year. Customers responded favorably to newness with shoes and beauty leading our results. As a reminder, historically, every several years we have a shift in our Anniversary event which moves one week of the event into the third quarter. As a result, our comp decrease of 1.2% was unfavorably impacted by roughly 250 basis points.","On May 18, we achieved an important milestone with the expansion of our loyalty program. Nordstrom Rewards serves as a powerful tool to drive incremental sales and trips. Even more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers. In response to feedback for more flexibility in joining our program, we've expanded it so that all of our customers can earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay. We're encouraged with the strong response. We now have around 6 million total Rewards customers who shopped with us over the last year, up significantly from 4.7 million last quarter.","As we head into the second half of the year, we are focused on a number of initiatives to improve the customer experience and drive top-line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we're expanding our reach to serve more customers. We're building on the success of our Canada expansion with two full-line store openings in Toronto. On September 16, we will open a flagship at Eaton Centre followed by another store at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21. In the U.S., we will open a second full-line store in Austin, Texas on September 30. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we plan to open 15 stores this fall for a total of 215 by the end of the year.","Our merchandise strategy remains focused on providing our customers with newness. Our efforts to grow relevant brands that have limited distribution play an important role in creating excitement and attracting new customers. They now make up the majority of our top 20 fastest-growing vendors and we're continuing to expand the most highly sought-after brands like IVY PARK, Madewell, and Charlotte Tilbury with new partnerships to come.","In addition to providing a differentiated product offering, we recognize that our customers desire a personalized and convenient experience. To meet their evolving expectations, we are making digital enhancements to better serve customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We have several initiatives underway that include new mobile features, improvements to our website, and enhanced selling tools. In the second quarter, we've made ongoing improvements to our mobile app, including features that enable customers to shop their store of choice and shop for items based on a visual search. This fall, we are piloting a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try on in our stores.","In closing, our ability to deliver strong Anniversary results while realigning inventory and expense speaks volumes to the quality of our team. We're proud of the team's high level of execution and remain committed to continuing this progress. Next quarter, we look forward to providing further updates on our efforts, including our expanded loyalty program and performance in Canada.","I'll now turn it over to Mike, who will provide additional color on our results and our ongoing efforts to improve our business models.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Blake. Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on our second quarter results. As we evolve our business model, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we can serve customers with high-quality products and services while achieving profitable growth.","Our earnings per diluted share of $0.67 were ahead of our expectations, driven by our strong execution of the Anniversary Sale, inventory management, and expense control. We are also continuing to see benefits from the strategic growth investments we've made to fuel growth in new markets and ecommerce. These investments, HauteLook, our expansion into Canada, and Trunk Club are expected to contribute over $1 billion to our top-line in 2016. Our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, and Trunk Club had a combined comp decrease of 2.3%. This reflected an unfavorable impact of over 250 basis points from the event shift. The momentum of Nordstrom Rack, consisting of stores and online, continued with a comp increase of 5.3% on top of last year's increase of 6.5%.","Over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively adjusting our inventory plans as consumer demand has changed. We have a complex portfolio of businesses, and combined with the uncertainty of sales trends, our merchant and planning teams were making continuous adjustments. That high level of execution combined with a compelling product offering for the Anniversary Sale drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our inventories are well-positioned, current and in line with our sales trends. As a result, we are on the offense, focused on bringing in the latest and most compelling product offering that resonates with our customers.","In terms of our broader efforts to improve profitability, we recognize that the shift towards e-commerce is having an impact to our financial model. As we accelerate investments to support changes in customer expectations, our expenses, particularly in technology, supply chain, and marketing, grew faster than sales. To address this, we are continuing to make operational changes to right-size this trajectory. As we shared last quarter, we identified over $150 million in productivity improvements this year, of which roughly half has been realized to-date.","We are streamlining corporate headquarters and executed on a number of initiatives that will enhance the customer experience and improve our operating model. In technology, we're on a path to modernize our platform and increase the productivity of delivering features that will improve the customer experience. For example, this year, we implemented new technology solutions that support our expanded loyalty program and online search engine. These modernized platforms enable us to serve customers in a more personalized and relevant way.","In supply chain, we've executed on several initiatives to improve operating performance. This included optimizing our supplier network for both inbound and outbound carriers, reducing split shipments through a greater allocation of merchandise to our fulfillment centers and editing out less profitable items online.","A year ago, we opened our East Coast fulfillment center, which has the potential to double our fulfillment capacity as we scale for growth. For customers we serve on the East Coast, we've been able to speed up delivery times by over 30% with lower unit shipping costs due to the increased proximity to our customers. In continuing these efforts, we are further integrating Trunk Club's operations into the Nordstrom fulfillment network with completion expected by mid-2017.","In marketing, we are repositioning our organization to better align with the customer journey and our strategic priorities around customer acquisition and retention. This includes strengthening our capabilities around customer analytics and digital engagement so that we can reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.","Our expanded loyalty program demonstrates our efforts to rebalance our marketing resources towards a greater focus on personalization. This will help us better serve customers and increase their lifetime value.","In addition to the adjustments we've made to inventory and expense, we have re-prioritized our capital investments to better align with changing customer expectations and strengthen our financial position. This resulted in a 10% reduction to our five-year capital plan.","Our reduced CapEx plan of $3.6 billion is appropriately balanced between store and technology investments. We have made a modest reduction to our Rack store expansion plans, given the growth of our online business, which has doubled since the launch of Nordstromrack.com a couple years ago.","All of these efforts to improve our productivity will result in a more productive use of financial resources, which is beginning to positively impact our results. During the second quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was $853 million, more than twice what it was last year.","Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. We have adjusted our earnings per share outlook to $2.60 to $2.75 from our prior outlook of $2.50 to $2.70. As we head into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business while also being mindful of uncertainty in retail trends.","In closing, as our business evolves, we remain confident in our ability to serve customers in an exemplary way and achieve sustainable profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we believe Nordstrom will emerge stronger and better positioned for future success.","I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We will now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Thank you. Good afternoon. I was just hoping that you could give us some clarity on which of the categories you saw the most sequential improvement in during the Anniversary Sale, and how you're modeling receipts for those specific categories coming into the back-half?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","This is Pete. We experienced some good success in a few categories. You heard us call out Beauty and Shoes, in particular. I think categories within there, boots were particularly good for us in Shoes. In Apparel, our denim business was strong, as were sweaters.","In terms of how that impacts our inventory plans going forward, I think, for us, we're really well served to try to keep our inventory plans conservative. We've been able to prove over the years that we can exceed sales plans with conservative inventory plans. And when you do that, I mean, obviously it just \u2013 it creates a good scenario for us in reducing markdowns.","So I think while we're happy about the sales results, we're very cautious not to over-invest either our plans just in the way that we're allocating inventory. So we're still taking a cautious approach here for the second half.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So the Rack seems to be striking a really nice balance with stable brick-and-mortar and then outsized online growth, but the full-line still remains negative. What do you think off-price is delivering that the full-line's missing? And what's the best way to think about initiatives in place to drive better traffic at the full-line?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Well \u2013 Matthew, this is Blake. We don't look at it as the Rack's doing something that the full-line store's missing, that those are different businesses. There's some similarities. But we're making terrific progress within the full-line stores. And that trend improved greatly in that second quarter. So the Rack's had a more consistent business the last couple of years than the full-line stores, but we've got a team on the full-price business, the Nordstrom brand.","And we view it together, both the stores and the online, as one business. And it's, over time, becoming more and more merged because the customer doesn't view that as two different experiences. But, that said, there are experiences that \u2013 with products and experiences in the store and online that the customers desire and deems as good service, and it's a fluid thing. And we're working on a number of initiatives, and we're encouraged about, on the Anniversary Sale, the feedback and response we got and the opportunities we have going forward.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Matt. This is Mike. The one thing I would also add to that is you have to look at the relative maturity of the online channel in the full-price sector versus the off-price. And we're one of the few that actually have an online offering off-price. Most off-price is done in-store. So I think there's a little bit of apples and oranges there in terms of comparing the two.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great point. Good luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Yeah, guys. Question on the service levels in the store. If you continue to see drops in same-store sales, are you making adjustments in selling payroll? Because obviously your online business is more of a variable cost model and you've got that fixed cost in the store, and if it \u2013 we continue to see negative comps, obviously that is going to continue to weigh on your EBIT margins. But \u2013 so I guess I'm asking a question \u2013 I'm also making a comment. Do you risk \u2013 if that's the case, and if you do adjust payroll on the downside, are you risking service levels, I guess \u2013 inferior service levels in-store?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. This is Mike. I think the first point I would make there is, certainly, a key differentiator for us is our service levels. So we're very conscious of assuring that we deliver that high level of service. But keep in mind, in our regular-price business in the full-line stores, that's a 100% commission-based sales force. So, by its very nature, it does adjust to the overall level of sales volume activity. And certainly, we also ensure that we have the right level of staffing there to ensure that we can deliver the right level of service. So I think that's something that we'd prefer not to compromise.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. I apologize if I missed it, but did you give the actual comp for the Anniversary Sale? And also, if you can just touch on the narrower spread between comp and overall sales growth this quarter.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Paul. We didn't break out the actual Anniversary Sale comp. In terms of the difference between the total sales and the comp sales, the recent it was so \u2013 the spread was so narrow is, at the end of every quarter, we're required to make a number of adjustments that primarily relate to the timing of sales and the timing of returns at the end of every quarter. And because of the high volume of Anniversary, that tends to be a higher adjustment at the end of the second quarter. It's basically timing, and it's a GAAP adjustment. And that will reappear next quarter.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up. Could you just speak to merchandise margins in the second quarter versus your expectations coming in? And given where inventories are now, how should we think about that line item in the second half?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well, the line item that we report is gross profit. And interestingly enough, our overall merchandise margins in our Nordstrom brand, our full-price business, were roughly equal to last year. Most of the impact we had in negative merchandise margins came through the off-price business. We also had some deterioration in the gross profit as a result of increased occupancy costs with the opening of new Rack stores. But basically the regular-price business was roughly on \u2013 better than it \u2013 I'm sorry, better than expectations but equal to last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was \u2013 is the big delta versus your expectation in 2Q the stronger execution in the Anniversary Sale? And if so, could you talk about maybe some of the things that you might have done differently this Anniversary Sale versus prior sales, besides just moving the date?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yeah, this is Pete. No, I think it's fair to say that Anniversary was a good catalyst for us in terms of getting some positive top-line results, but I think what really made it happen for us is the way that we manage inventories, and we went into a very conservative plan at the beginning of the year when we recognized that the sales momentum and trends were tough. We've made the adjustments necessary for the sale given the current reality of the sales trends. And so, once we got that down, what happened is we ended up having very good sell-through on our Anniversary product, which puts us in a great position for the fall. So that's probably what contributes to the bottom-line the most, is just the efficient application and deployment of inventory.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","And I'd just want to add \u2013 this is Erik \u2013 just mainly as is usually the case, it's the product that drives, especially Anniversary. But I think we did get some lift from the enhancement of our Rewards program. By launching the non-tender part of our Rewards program, it allowed us to connect with customers in a more direct way.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And I was hoping I could just follow up on traffic. Could you comment on sequential changes in traffic?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Now, well, you know we really don't track traffic within our stores. I would say, generally speaking, it was roughly \u2013 for the quarter, roughly equivalent to what it has been. I don't think there was any big news there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you so much. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the merchandise margin comments. I thought you said that the pressure in merchandise margin is coming from the off-price business. Could you just talk about that a little bit, is that related to returns? Is it the off-price ecommerce business that's pressuring that margin? And did you see any increased markdowns in the full-price business?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Yeah, Kimberly, I would say the markdown pressure that we were having in off-price is primarily related to the fact that we're still working through the operational challenges of operating an integrated in-store and online business. We still don't have all our systems fully aligned, we're still working through the challenges of taking online returns in the stores, and finding the right way to balance our inventories based on that kind of flow. And so, that caused us to take some more markdowns. Now that being said, we continue to make progress there and we're narrowing the gap, and I think as we go forward that should continue to be a better news story for us.","In terms of full-line, the markdowns, I wouldn't say the markdowns were necessarily better than they were last year, but they were certainly better than our plan for the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","I wanted to follow up on some the comments you just made about the loyalty program, the tender-agnostic version I think you rolled out in May. What you're seeing there, are you getting a lot of sign-ups from new customers, and how much you're able to expand that program in terms of members? Is the program, from the consumer side, the same sort of benefits, whether you're participating in the credit card or whether you're a tender-agnostic loyalty member? What kind of information you can get from that program as you build out that base? It seems pretty interesting from our perspective. Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","Yeah, thanks, Omar. This is Erik. The program works \u2013 for a non-tender, the rewards are one point for every dollar spent where it's two points for every dollar spent if a customer has our card, so it's a little different level of reward there. The real appeal of \u2013 to refer \u2013 the one for customers is there's just no barrier to sign up. It's an e-mail. The identifier is the customer's mobile number, and it takes a few seconds to sign-up and anyone can participate in it. So it's been received really well by customers who just see it as a very friction-free way of enhancing their and being rewarded for their shopping experience.","For us, we've \u2013 as you know, our Reward program has long been one of the main drivers of our business, our attention, our loyalty, and it helps. I mean, getting those reward notes out to customers really helps. But the second piece, which I think is what you're touching on is the information, having a lot more customers involved in our program, and we've signed up through the quarter about 1.5 million customers into our non-tender program. It allows us to, number one, connect with them; and number two, deliver a much more personalized experience for them. So that's the longer-term unlock that we're particularly excited about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just going back to the merchandise margin pressure at Rack, I'm just curious, can you just remind us what percent of Rack's product comes from the full-line stores? And has that changed over the last couple of quarters? Is that having any sort of an impact on merch margin at Rack? When you talk about merch margins, how do you account for the product that transfers from full-price to Rack? Does it count against full-price merch margins or Rack? And just where do you see that mix going forward in terms of what percent of Rack's product comes from full-price? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Paul, this is Blake. It's been fairly consistent for some time, and where it does change very slightly is if we change, in any material way, the amount of Racks we have, because the full-line stores have been fairly consistent. But it's approximately 15% of the merchandise, at this point, comes from the full-line stores, and then the rest of the merchandise are with our top vendors, their closeouts, and it's \u2013 and that merchandise allows us to be very current and have a good offering in sizes and balance.","In terms of the margin, and Mike alluded to it earlier, there's different components that affect the markdowns, and part of it is the merchandise that comes from the full-line stores. So we're dealing with immediate impact today, but there's also a tail to it, so as we're addressing merchandise over the last \u2013 first half of the year, it has go through our system, both the full-line stores and online and then through our Racks. And so, some of that stuff that didn't sell well at full-price has been challenged a little bit at off-price, and so we're taking the necessary markdowns in all of our businesses upfront to try to address what is the right price to clear these goods. And I think, overall, the most important thing is, whether it's the Rack or our stores, we're in one of the best inventory positions we've been in, in many years. We're able to respond to the customer, partner with our vendors and have good flow, and a lot of good things come from that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much, and good afternoon. I think last quarter you talked about a big delta between your sale customer and your full-price customers. So just wondering, prior to the Anniversary Sale, if you were seeing any change in customer shopping patterns. And then as far as your gross margin opportunity to recover, price matching I know has been a big issue and now we talk about some of the vendors wanting to pullback themselves from the Friends & Family and couponing. So just have you changed your perspective on what price matching means to your customer now that it seems like every client out there is already looking at transparency?","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","I'll take the first one. This is Erik. And Pete will take the second. As far as comparing our regular-price customers to our sale customers, look, the first thing to understand is Anniversary is unlike any other sale, certainly we have, and I think unlike any sales out there. It's not a clearance sale, so it's not older merchandise that's priced to clear out in broken size runs. It's just brand-new merchandise that \u2013 full-size runs that we mark back up after the sale. So the behavior we've long seen from customers around Anniversary is much more around a regular-price customer who is motivated by newness than it is a sale customer that's motivated by price promotion. So, in that regard, I would say our trends have really been unchanged, that our business continues to be driven by customers who are looking for newness as opposed to customers looking for the one-day sale.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","With regards to price matching \u2013 this is Pete \u2013 our practices remain the same. But I think it's fair to say that the promotional activity has stabilized a bit here in the last quarter or so.","To the point you made, there's vendors out there choosing to participate in different ways than they may have in the past with our competitors. What we're trying to do is put ourselves in a real favorable position with vendors to be the retailer of choice for them, and what that means for most of the vendors we deal with is our desire, strong desire, to sell at full-price. And so, we focus a lot on flow and newness and all that.","So I think in terms of the price matching thing, it's \u2013 we've had a lot of success and growth with brands, again, that are aligned with us in trying to sell at full-price. And where you see kind of the growth by brand in some of these brands that maybe aren't entirely ubiquitously distributed but have good growth prospects and we try to identify those brands kind of early-on in that trajectory so we can partner with them to grow really healthy business together.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Jaffe from Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much, guys, and congratulations. Really lots of good news in the call.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Richard.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It's my pleasure. The Canadian business, I know, has a different leasing structure and you're ending up paying rent before you would generate sales to offset that rent. And I'm wondering where that process stands? I know you've opened a few Canadian stores. Are you now paying rent on the next wave of Canadian stores, and the size of that liability, if you will? And then a second question, if you would. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Richard, this is Mike. As you may recall, we have shared, and I think we shared directionally on one of the slides the impact that our investment in Canada is having on our P&L, and some of that does relate to how we need to recognize rent.","Right now, we have three full-line stores that are yet to open that are in process; two that will open this fall that will start to get some sales, and the third that will open next spring. So I think some \u2013 in 2017, we should start to see the overall volumes of the six stores we'll have there start to move forward and mitigate the loss impact from all those investments.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I read somewhere that Canada \u2013 Canada, I'm sorry; New York City, is 2019, is that in time for the holiday season 2019, or still a work in progress?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I would say, overall, it's still a work in progress, but we'd love to be open by holiday 2019.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","That's our plan; yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.\/Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ed.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.\/Pacific Crest Securities","Just real quickly on Trunk Club, in looking at the slide you have on 10, it looks like you've been able to, or at least point to minimization of some of the other costs of Canada and Rack, dot-com. I guess how should we think about the cost trajectory at Trunk Club?","And then as a follow-up, I noticed you tweaked your credit income guidance a little bit, so any insight into drivers there would be helpful. Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","Okay. This is Erik. I'll take the Trunk Club question. Trunk Club is \u2013 we've had it for two years. It's still I think very much a start-up business that's having high growth. Our results have been in-line with our expectations. But it's a business that is increasingly getting integrated into our business. The merchandising and supply chain would be probably the biggest examples. So it certainly helps from leveraging costs, but more, it's leveraging capabilities to deliver a better customer experience. So I think you'll see us continue to find ways to integrate it and leverage the strengths of our businesses to serve customers across those channels.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ed, in terms of the credit side of the business, there's a couple things in there. One is that we've made some very good progress on improving our fraud results, and that has shown a better-than-plan performance. And, in addition, we're starting to see some early signs of some benefits of our partnership from \u2013 in the revenue-sharing agreement we have. So we had a little good news on the top-line there and some good news within the expense and credit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Could you...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Could you help us on \u2013 just reconcile a couple of things really quickly. From a position of strength, I suppose, as you've accelerated the Rack a little bit now and you sound a much more positive on the outlook there than you have in the last few quarters, but you did lower your long-term store outlook for Rack, and I think it was part of a bigger capital tightening plan. But as a bigger picture relatively, this is a relatively low store-count chain at this point. Can you help us think about how you see the store opportunity longer-term here if the reduction that you did make was done more out of a necessity during some fairly high volatility around the P&L that the industry saw over the last few quarters?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Michael, this is Blake. We shared a couple quarters back that we had an estimate that we thought we could be around 300 stores by 2020. We are sensitive to the capital deployment but as we've said, the Rack stores have been a good return on the shareholders' investment. I think what we said in our remarks and what we're mindful of is just the terrific growth online that's coming, and so we want to be sensitive with our resources and what we're short-term committing to.","So we didn't have, when we talked about 300 stores to be exact, that include Canada. We think Canada could have roughly 15 Racks when we're done. We start with our first Rack in 2018 I believe, and so when we put the 15 stores with kind of the reduced number, we're just shy of 300 stores at this point, but it's not a linear thing. When these opportunities come forward in key locations, we take advantage of that and that could go up a little bit or it could come down. But to the best of our knowledge today, we think it's just under 300 stores at this point by 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Forte from Maxim Group.","Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. So two things. On the East Coast fulfillment center, should we think of the benefits on shorter ship miles as immediate or something that ramps up over time? And then on mobile ecommerce, can you talk at all about either conversion or mix of ecommerce sales that's coming from mobile ecommerce? Because it seems like you've made some adjustments to your app and improvements there. Thank you.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","So, Tom, this is Blake. On the East Coast fulfillment center, it's relatively new. We opened it last fall and it's ramping up. The first test was the holidays last year and then our Anniversary event, so it hasn't gotten to full capacity. And so what we're saying is that we're well-positioned where a good portion of our customers live, and so we're able to improve the delivery times and our execution, but it's not at full operating strength like our Cedar Rapids facility that's been open for some time. So I think the main thing is that we're on track at this early point one year in, and it's providing a meaningful way to service our customers with opportunities to be more efficient down the road.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","This is Erik. On the split between mobile and desktop for our ecommerce business, certainly mobile is outpacing desktop and it has been for some time and we've continued to see that, quite a delta between those channels. And just to clarify, we have two ways of conducting mobile commerce. One's through a mobile browser, the other's through our app, and both we're seeing quite outsized gains in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Good afternoon. Congratulations on a great result here.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Neely.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Yeah, you bet. So, Erik, for you, I think I remember hearing 5 million sign-ups for the Rewards of non-tender base, is that still \u2013 did I hear that right, and is that still on track? And more importantly, Anniversary Sale's a great catalyst to get people to sign up. Are there incremental events planned in the back half to drive that? And, Mike, for you a housekeeping question on SG&A. When you take that big large Anniversary Sale week and move it into Q3, I think back in 2012 it actually did drive some interesting and outsized sort of leverage on SG&A. Could you give us any sort of contextualization to guidance around, like, how we should be thinking about the SG&A leverage in Q3 this year because of the shift? Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","Hi, Neely. Yeah, it's \u2013 we look at it as one program, it's our Fashion Rewards program, and there's two ways for customers to participate in it. Overall, we're up to 6 million participants in the program and we're clearly in the early stages of the non-tender offer there. Anniversary provides tremendous opportunity to sign-up customers for our Rewards program, it always has. It's been a big driver of opening our credit accounts previously. Now, it does provide the opportunity to additionally add the non-tender portion of it. So we're very pleased with the rate of sign-ups in both the card and the non-tender and have a lot of plans to continue that.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Neely, in terms of the SG&A, we haven't broken that out by quarter. Those assumptions are included in our guidance for the year. But, that being said, it's probably a relatively consistent directionally accurate relationship between what happened in 2012.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thank you. I was curious about your customer research. On your customer research, what would you say customers really want that you don't yet offer? And what are the longer-term implications for how you allocate CapEx towards IT to kind of address what's evolving there? Also, related to the future \u2013 just on a long-term basis, how do you see your brand composition evolving in terms of ensuring that you have the specialness that is required in this new version of retail that we're in now?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","I'll take the first part. I guess, what do we not have that customers want? You know, I would say...","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yeah, I think you've been on top of it. You're like a case study for knowing the customer. That's what you guys do best. And you were ahead of the curve, like, five years ago with Rack and free shipping. So I'm sure \u2013 what's 5G and Generation Z, and what are they asking you for?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Well, this is Pete. I would say probably the evergreen subject there is any enabler to service \u2013 and technology has been the best enabler to improving customer service that we have in integrating multiple channels and all that stuff. So I think that that's going to be an ongoing deal for us. Outside of that, if you look at it more kind of in the bigger picture, it has so much to do with what we have to offer \u2013 the products we have to offer. And a big part of our success is online as we're able to add to our selection there. That was really helpful. Customers liked that a lot.","And I think one of the things that happens slightly on the downside of that is the context it creates for some stores. There's so much more available online than there might be at any given store. So I think our ongoing challenge is to do the best we can to make sure each store has the best possible product offer that it has, and the kind of stuff that customers ask about are the things that are hard to get. And they ask for that everywhere. And that has to do with some of the limited distribution stuff that's obvious \u2013 that's usually connected to designer or what have you. But knowing we can't get that everywhere, we do the best we can to put it in places we think it'll be successful. But that's been an ongoing subject for us forever. And it's just retailing stuff that we work on every day.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oliver, this is Mike. In terms of the IT, if you look at our allocation of capital today, we've got over a third of our capital focused on IT investment. And post the completion of Manhattan and Canada, it'll be even a larger proportion. So we're highly committed there, and if you ask what that's going to mean to the future and what we're trying to do, so much of the investment we're making today is to build a platform that's going to allow us to, in a much more frictionless way, develop applications for the customer to make the experience with us very dynamic and very easy. And so we're highly committed to making those investments. And the path we're on is, not only are we moving very fast to make those investments, but we're also learning as we go. So we're going to continue to move down that path.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","And Oliver, this is Blake. Your last question, as I recall, was on brand composition \u2013 composition and levels, degree of specialness. As I mentioned \u2013 both Mike and I did, we look at it from the Nordstrom brand, and which is our full-price stores, and dot-com, and Trunk Club business, and our Nordstrom Rack brand, which is inclusive of HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com as well. And so we think the customer views it that way. And there's an opportunity to be current and relevant, and to ensure that the experience they have, whether online or in our stores, through our people and through our product, is meeting and exceeding their expectations. And it's a very fluid thing. And we need to keep testing and trying things and evolve to be in lockstep with our customer.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Good afternoon, and congrats on a nice quarter.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just wanted to dig into inventory one more time. Could you just talk about the trends you're seeing in the full-line versus the Rack? And really, are there any constraints in procuring the inventory that's needed to fuel growth in off-price?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","This is Pete. At this time, we don't really see that. I mean, that's part of what Blake mentioned in terms of what we think is a reasonable growth plan for the Rack business. We have to contemplate that, getting the supply that we need from vendors. But to this point, that's not really been a challenge. Again, if we can position ourselves as the retailer of choice based on the type of business we're trying to do with full-price, doing it at a high service quality level and being able to present brands in the best possible way and with all the customers that we serve, that's a compelling \u2013 it's a compelling formula, I think, for vendors. So we just \u2013 it's not really been a challenge for us, at this point. It's ongoing and this stuff evolves. But at this point, we feel good about our plans going forward.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now introduce Rob Campbell, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin, sir.","Robert E. Campbell","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last approximately 45 minutes and will include about 30 minutes for your questions.","As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed, due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom Inc.; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's fourth quarter and full year performance and the outlook for fiscal 2013. Blake is traveling today, so he is participating in the call, but not with us at our headquarters.","Before we begin, I want to mention that similar to last quarter, we are using slides to supplement our remarks. If you are listening to this conference call at the webcast, you should already see the slides. If you're listening by telephone, you can view the slides by going to the Investor Relations section at Nordstrom.com.","And now, I'll turn over the call to Blake Nordstrom.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter and 2012 results we announced earlier today reflect the ongoing consistent strength of our performance. 2012 marked our third consecutive year of double-digit total sales and EPS growth, our third consecutive year of adding over $1 billion in sales and our third consecutive year of same-store sales growth of over 7%. This accomplishment is largely attributable to the high level of execution we've achieved across all channels and to the investments we've made to fuel this performance.","Our #1 goal is to provide a superior customer experience. We aspire to be the retailer of choice wherever and whenever customers choose to shop with us. And we understand that our customers' definition of service is changing. We're excited about how we're combining our people, culture and technology along with new capabilities to expand our relationship with our customers, both in-store and online.","This focus on being a leader in delivering a superior customer experience has created multiple growth opportunities. And as we've shared with you over the last couple of years, we're aggressively taking action. All of them are in support of our overarching strategic priorities of: Improving the customer experience, enhancing the merchandise offering, increasing relevance with existing and new customers, aggressively growing our online capabilities.","More specifically, on this call a year ago, we shared with you 5 specific goals for 2012. Number one, build out our IT infrastructure to fuel our e-commerce growth. Number two, enhance the overall web and mobile experience. Number three, expand online merchandise selection and develop a more customized approach to all aspects of our engagement with customers. Number four, add to the functionality of mobile point-of-sale devices and expand their usage in full-line and Rack stores. And finally, number five, begin implementation of enhanced tools to improve the initial allocation and assortment of inventory.","During the course of the year, we made progress on each one of these initiatives. Increasingly, we are using technology as an enabler in improving the service experience for our customers across all fronts.","We've made notable improvements to the web and mobile experience. As examples, we've made enhancements to search, navigation and checkout. We've added numerous features, including updated recommendations and 360 video on certain product pages. We've improved the speed of fulfillment and delivery and we provided Early Access online to our Anniversary Sale. Going forward, we plan to further elevate the shopping experience with features that provide more interaction and personalization.","Customers are increasing their usage of mobile devices in shopping with us. On an average day, more than 100,000 unique customers access Nordstrom on a mobile device, with nearly twice that amount during the holidays. In 2012, sales from a mobile device accounted for over 20% of Direct's total sales, compared to less than 4% in 2010. There's more we can do here to build on the customer mobile experience to make it even more compelling.","Our online merchandise selection has expanded by over 50% and now is virtually at parity with our full-line selection. The selection will further expand to have the appropriate depth and breadth in our online offering.","In our stores, we are enhancing the service experience through the use of our mobile point-of-sale devices. In the third quarter, we successfully launched mobile devices in all of our Rack stores to make the checkout process faster.","In the first quarter of 2013, we will remove a portion of our cash registers in our Rack stores, which will add incremental selling space. In our full-line stores, our mobile devices now have virtually the same functionality as our cash registers. Their usage has increased, and our goal is to be largely mobile by 2014.","On the merchandise front, we started to see improvement in our women's apparel business in the latter half of the year. We also launched Topshop in 14 stores and online with its fast-turning, on-trend fashion at accessible prices, which is helping us deliver a more relevant shopping experience. We anticipate continuing improvement in our women's business in 2013 and an expansion of Topshop into more stores.","We continue to benefit from improved buying tools to better customize the offering by stores. Going forward, we will invest in scaling our merchandise systems to support our future growth.","During the year, we enhanced our Fashion Rewards program to simplify it and make the benefits more accessible to our customers. In response, we've opened a million new Fashion Rewards accounts in 2012. This program continues to help us reach new customers and deepen our relationships with existing ones.","So we've made meaningful progress on our stated priorities of a year ago. It's noteworthy that even with all of the investment spending associated with the strategic initiatives we've undertaken, our ROIC of 13.9% represented an increase over 2011 and was the highest in the last 5 years. Our Direct business, which generates the highest return and where we have been investing heavily, contributed to this improvement in ROIC.","At this time last year, we commuted our -- communicated our intention of expanding into Canada. Today, we have more clarity on our expansion plans, with an initial announcement in 2012 of 4 full-line stores and a view that we ultimately could have between 8 to 10 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores. We've announced Karen McKibbin as President of Nordstrom Canada to lead this effort, and she has started building a dedicated team. We look forward to serving both existing and new customers in these new markets.","At this time last year, our plan was to open roughly 15 Racks per year. Today, the plan is to double the number of Rack stores to more than 230 over the next 4 years, with roughly 24 openings in 2013 and more than 30 in 2014. Rack's total sales were up 20% in 2012, with same-store sales up 7.4%. Its sales productivity, even with the 15 new stores reached its highest level in recent years, over $550 per square foot.","Our Direct business increased nearly 30% in 2011 and in 2012, grew 37%, generating $1.3 billion in sales. It's our fastest-growing channel and it is expanding our reach to existing and new customers. We see substantial opportunities for outside growth to continue as we further improve the online customer experience.","At this time a year ago, we were still searching for a Manhattan full-line store location. Today, we have a great location near Columbus Circle, with a planned opening in 2018. During the year, we also announced future full-line openings in Houston, Jacksonville, Minneapolis and Milwaukee.","Our ongoing focus on providing a superior customer experience and increasing our relevance with existing and new customers has positioned us well for the significant growth opportunities we are pursuing. To be clear, we are a growth story, with a business and operating model consistent with that. It is these growth opportunities, whether Canada, Rack, e-commerce, Manhattan and other new full-line stores, and the improvements to our existing stores, that drive the investments we're making. Some of these investments yield immediate benefits, while others will benefit the future. We are confident that in total, they will provide a platform for sustainable, profitable growth, which we characterize by high single-digit total sales increases and mid-teens return on invested capital.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. As we look back on the year, we have surpassed our financial expectations and successfully executed against our long-term growth strategy. As Blake mentioned, we are positioned for growth through our aggressive pursuit of multiple strategic opportunities. We believe the continued momentum in our business, which is reflected by 3 consecutive years of double-digit sales and earnings growth, is driven by these ongoing investments to serve more customers and deliver a superior experience.","At this time last year, we shared with you our 2012 financial plans, including adding over $1 billion in sales and achieving earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.45. We exceeded those plans by delivering sales growth of 12%, or $1.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share of $3.56.","In 2012, we reached a record high in total sales productivity of $470 per square foot. An even more notable accomplishment was that our sales per square foot, excluding e-commerce, of $417, surpassed 2007's peak of $405. This demonstrates our continued belief that a well-executed multichannel strategy is about growing all channels.","As Blake noted, we increased ROIC to 13.9%, which represented our highest return over the last 5 years. This was particularly meaningful since we accomplished this while making capital investments of over $2 billion during this period.","Now I'd like to highlight our fourth quarter performance. Our results exceeded our expectations, with sales growth of 13%, same-store sales increases of 6.3% and growth in earnings per share of 26%. You can find more detail of our financial performance for both the quarter and the year in the Performance Summary document, which is posted on our website.","Our Fashion Rewards program played an integral role in contributing to our overall results. A year ago, we made improvements to our program to provide increased customer flexibility and to make the benefits more accessible. In response, we opened 1 million new accounts during the year, with cardholders continuing to spend more and shop more with us than non-members. In 2012, sales from our Fashion Rewards members increased over $800 million, or 23% over last year. We now have 3.3 million active members, which increased 27% from last year. Nordstrom card penetration reached nearly 36%, up from 32% a year ago.","Our execution in recent years has put us in a strong financial position. In each of the last 4 years, cash flow from operations exceeded $1 billion, and we have ample liquidity. Our capital allocation practices are disciplined and balanced. Additionally, our Credit business is healthy, with key metrics having improved to prerecession levels.","Next, I'd like to share our current thinking on our growth plans over the next several years. Our ongoing focus to provide a superior customer experience, coupled with our execution and strong financial position, has enabled us to undertake multiple growth initiatives. We believe these plans for future growth will provide a sustainable platform for achieving top quartile total shareholder returns.","Over the next 5 years, we plan to nearly double our capital expenditures relative to the last 5 years, due to investments in Canada, Manhattan, e-commerce and Rack. Our current 5-year capital plan is $3.7 billion. Roughly 20% represents entry into Canada and Manhattan, and approximately 55% is planned for a combination of new full-line stores, Rack stores and remodels. The remaining 25% relates to e-commerce and technology investments, including initiatives to improve our e-commerce delivery and fulfillment, online and mobile experience and personalization.","We are confident that these investments are creating significant long-term shareholder value, and they are changing the dynamics within our P&L. For example, our growth is altering our sales mix. We believe that within the next 5 years, Rack, Direct and Canada will make up approximately half of our sales. Our stores, which create the most visible representation of our brand, will continue to represent the majority of our overall business, but customers will clearly use e-commerce in the future more than they are today.","Given the infrastructure investments to support expansion into Canada and incremental growth-related costs associated with the Rack, and higher depreciation expense from ongoing e-commerce investments, we expect no expansion of EBIT margin over the next several years. EBITDAR, which strips out the growth-related expense components of depreciation and rent, is expected to grow faster than EBIT and illustrates the impact of these investments. Operating leverage in our existing stores continues, and collectively, their EBIT margin is planned to increase in 2013.","We are not relying on EBIT margin expansion to create value. As our financial model evolves with our growth, our overarching focus is on achieving high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens return on invested capital. We know these factors, combined with our growing capital base, will drive significant shareholder value.","Now I'd like to discuss our 2013 plan. To provide you with an apples-to-apples comparison, we removed the impact of the 53rd week from 2013 comparisons to 2012. We expect sales growth between 6% to 8%, with same-store sales increases between 3.5% to 5.5%. This reflects low single-digit growth in full-line and Rack stores and over 20% growth in Direct. Our plan achieves earnings per diluted share of $3.65 and $3.80, representing an increase of 4% to 8% over 2012.","Included in our guidance are upfront infrastructure expenses for Canada, as well as organizational and incremental preopening expenses related to Rack store expansion. In 2013, we expect these costs to be approximately $20 million to $25 million. The 53rd week will impact the quarterly cadence of 2013 compared to 2012, including the shift of our Anniversary Sale event between the second and third quarters. Our earnings release provides additional color on these impacts.","With respect to our line item guidance, which is compared to 53 weeks in 2012, gross profit rate is expected to decline between 10 and 30 basis points, primarily due to accelerated Rack growth and higher expenses associated with the growth in our Fashion Rewards program.","Retail SG&A as a percent of sales is expected to improve 10 to 30 basis points due to leverage on higher sales volume. The increase in credit SG&A reflects the absence of the $30 million reduction in bad debt reserves in 2012.","Turning to capital. We anticipate net capital expenditures in the range of $750 million to $790 million. This is a significant increase from $455 million in 2012 and is primarily related to Rack and full-line store growth, improvements in e-commerce delivery and fulfillment and our Manhattan store development. We expect net depreciation and amortization in 2013 to be approximately $390 million, up from $366 million in 2012.","Free cash flow is planned to be approximately $130 million for 2013. This is down from $340 million in 2012 due to our capital expenditures. We expect cash flow from operations to be approximately","$1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2012.","In closing, we are pleased with our progress to date. We're excited about the numerous opportunities ahead of us and confident in our ability to successfully execute our growth initiatives. We remain disciplined in our approach while","moving faster in our execution. Overall, we believe our relentless desire to provide a superior customer experience will lead to continued growth in our business and increasing shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Question-and-Answer Session","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Now we'll take the first question.","Operator","Our first question today is from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, can you discuss the gross margin performance in the quarter? Maybe just give us a little more color?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, our gross profit benefited this quarter by an improvement in markdowns year-over-year. We saw some significant improvement in our women's apparel business, which was reflected in that. And that was partially offset by the increased cost as it relates to our Fashion Rewards program. But overall, a relatively good merchandise margin performance.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And as you guide for the future, you talked about not relying on EBIT margin expansion to drive future growth. Can you maybe -- and obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces and Internet growth and growth in the outlets, in the Rack business. As we look at all the moving pieces and not much full-line growth, how shall we kind of think about one offsetting the other?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, I think the first way to look at it is the chart that we shared that showed the change in the growth in the businesses and how they're contributing to the overall sales of the company. I think in terms of the EBIT margin expansion, the most important thing to remember is over the next several years, we're going to be investing to ensure we have a long-term sustainable growth platform. And the investments such as the accelerated technology investments, the upfront investments required to move into Canada, the acceleration of the Rack, all those things have a medium-term impact on our margin performance, but are there to assure that we've got a platform to deliver much larger dollar earnings growth over the long term.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","My first question is on Savvy. In some stores, where you've reconfigured the department and brought in merchandise at very sharp price points, I just was curious to know the reception to that. And I'm not sure how many stores you have done that in.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Jennifer, this is Blake. The Savvy departments, as you know, have gone through a transformation. We've been working on it for some time, and the official launch in the stores was February 15. It's all stores, and we've taken a pretty dramatic change with the merchandise offering. And so the goal is to try to help attract customers that maybe we didn't have an offering before or wasn't as compelling. And part of that was keeping the fashion-forward trend part of it, but trying to make the price points more accessible. And it's a pretty dramatic change, average price, from what Savvy was before to this new Savvy concept. And so we've only got a couple of days under our belt, but I think we're really excited about that offering and the early reception we've gotten so far.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","Great. And my follow-up is if you could talk about California, Southern Cal, O.C., L.A., San Diego, Northern Cal.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, I happen to be on the phone at our Grove store right now. So I'm in Los Angeles right now. And Southern California and California in general has consistently, over time, represented some of our most productive stores. And in the last couple of years, with the cycles in the economy, it's had some impact there. In addition to women's apparel improving, we've been pleased with California improving as well. Southern California still represents some opportunities for us, but the most important thing is the trend is improving. And so we're encouraged.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Mike, can you -- a little bit of insights on Rack for my first question. Second, the follow-up, would just be a little bit more on the e-commerce delivery and fulfillment initiative. So I think you guys had listed about 16 Rack stores. Could that number actually end up being higher this year? And would that higher -- more Rack stores actually already be contemplated then in the CapEx indications that you are giving to us?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Those are the stores that have currently been announced. Our CapEx plan has allocated for more stores for 2013.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, okay. It seemed to me -- I think at one point, you guys were talking about getting to about 230 by 2016 and that would suggest maybe a mid- to high-20 sort of number for Rack. Is that about the right way to look at that?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. That's in the range.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, cool. And then on the -- can you give us some specific insights on the initiatives? You guys have cited specifically e-commerce delivery fulfillment. Are these physical centers? Or what specifically are those initiatives that you are allocating capital for?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. In terms of the fulfillment and the 2013 allocation, it's about additional square footage to improve our fulfillment base. And it's also about improving some of the -- we have to increase capacity in Cedar Rapids just because of our unit flow-through has gotten so large, we have to install some new equipment. So it's about staying ahead of the curve because we're seeing some pretty accelerated growth in that channel.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the return on invested capital profile of both Direct and of the Rack business, and particularly as it relates to the step-up in CapEx? I mean, is it expected that ROIC can continue to improve despite CapEx being stepped up so meaningfully for 2013?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Ed. Well, as we've stated, our long-term goal is a mid-teen return on invested capital. And I think what one of the interesting factors has been, over the last several years, with adding an accelerated capital of over $2 billion, we've still increased the ROIC. So we do expect to see forward progress there. In terms of the profile of the channels, as we've stated before, Direct, because of the way the technology investment behaves, we have more upfront expense, a faster write-off tends to have a lower capital base and thus has a higher return on capital. Rack is a more traditional return because we do have to capitalize the leases. It tends to have a more longer term fixed base and does operate at a higher-than-company average, but at a more traditional return on invested capital.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got you. And you do this from time to time, metrics on what your Fashion Rewards customer looks like relative to your normal consumer. But what does your multichannel consumer look like relative to someone that shops strictly in your physical channel?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, clearly, I think one of the things that we've shared is our customer -- the customer who's shopping online, shopping mobile, tends to have a slightly younger profile, as is the Rack customer. Our multichannel customer is, I would say, an aggregate of our best customers. And I don't believe there's any particular profile in terms of how you categorize that demographically, other than they happen to be our best customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you give a bit more detail around the complexion of your infrastructure investments into Canada? How much of that is labor, distribution, kind of preopening -- other pre-opening expenses?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Erica. Well, just to step back, the $20 million to $25 million that we called out for 2013, roughly 2\/3 of that relates to Canada. And it's mostly around the development of our technology infrastructure to support that business, as well as the buildout of the team that's going to run that business. We're starting to build out the merchandise team and the operating team there. And so that's basically what hits 2013. In 2014, we'll start to see that expand. And some of the other costs that you're suggesting will come to light in 2014. The balance of that investment relates to preopening and accelerated Rack growth, both organization and the preopening costs required to open more stores.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That is very helpful. And then just a follow-up to one of Jennifer's questions. How are you communicating the new Savvy concept to the customers that you might not have been attracting before?","Michael G. Koppel","Blake?","Blake W. Nordstrom","You bet. We're taking a multipronged approach. We've been bringing this merchandise in over the last month or 2, so there's been a transition. And so working with the existing customers in the store, we're using all forms of communications, all the different channels within social. This is not about running a traditional ad or TV program, but it is trying to utilize the strong foot traffic in our stores and the various means that we stay communicated with our customers and how our customers have shared with us how they want us to communicate with them. And so again, I think, already in a couple of days, we've had a terrific reception. So in many cases, it's less about having kind of a formal word out. It's more about executing in the department of the merchandise offering and having the salespeople and the product knowledge and the fashion expertise to help our customers. So those vendors that were in Savvy, 70% to 80% of them have been moved into other departments. So we've really retained, for the most part, that merchandise. We just allocated in different lifestyle departments. And we think we really are starting to fill a void with some of these aspirational price points and higher fashion trend items that maybe was lacking a little bit in our offering.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about how you formulate your comp plan? And if there is upside to the same-store sales growth in 2013, is there is some opportunity for SG&A leverage?","Michael G. Koppel","Lorraine, this is Mike. In terms of a comp plan, in the overall operating plan we shared, it's consistent with our internal operating plans. The comp plan was built on a low single-digit comp for our full-line and Rack stores, and a slightly greater than 20% comp for our Direct business.","In terms of any leverage, we could get leverage if sales outperform. And that's consistent with how we've shared in the past. We will update that on a quarterly basis if we think we're going to get more operating leverage from our sales performance.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then as you look to your new Rack openings for this year, can you talk about the maturity curve of the new stores and how you're planning that from a cash flow perspective over the next couple of years?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, in terms of the maturity curve, overall, the Rack stores tend to mature at roughly a 3-year point, and then they get to a more normal growth. In terms of cash flow, I don't have any granular kind of guidance to give you in terms of the individual store performance, other than the fact that it's -- our overall ability to generate cash, as we said with 2013, is consistent with which the way it's been in prior years. And as a matter fact, in 2013, it's slightly better.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up, Mike, on your top line commentary. Is the low single-digit comp for the full-line and the Rack and the 20% growth for Direct, is that just your baseline view? Or is there something that you've seen in the business that's kind of leading to that 3.5% to 5.5% comp view, just given that if we adjust for your Anniversary Sale last year, you guys haven't had a comp below 5.8% since you were negative in 2009. And obviously, we saw acceleration in the Rack last year. We saw acceleration in Direct sales last year, and both those segments are becoming bigger pieces of your business. So just -- if you can add any color to that, that'd be helpful.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. I'll repeat what I said earlier, and that is it's reflective of our internal operating plans. We like to plan our business in a way that helps us gain as much leverage when we do have upside, and to instill discipline within the organization around inventory and expense. And that's consistent with how we've done it. And if we do beat those plans, that our intent is to be able to drive additional earnings from that plan.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So there's no change in your thoughts around the macro environment or your core consumer?","Michael G. Koppel","There's nothing at this point that would suggest any change in our customers' behavior.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you talk to merchandise margins in the quarter and also where merchandise margins stand today versus long-term peak? And finally, with credit rewards and Rack becoming a larger piece of the pie, where, how should we think about gross margins over the long term in the model?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, in terms of margin for the quarter, as I stated earlier, we had a very good merchandise margin performance in the fourth quarter. And a lot of that was driven by the improvement in the women's apparel business. We're starting to see much better sell-throughs in women's apparel. That's a strong business for us, and we expect it to continue.","In terms of long term, we have a number of dynamics that are affecting merchandise margin. One is the fact that as Rack continues to grow and accelerate, it has a lower merchandise margin than full-line. Now it has an equal to better bottom line margin, but it's going to affect the geography within the P&L. Our overall merchandise margins right now are at or around their all-time highs. We don't expect any significant expansion there. Clearly, we've seen a little bit of contraction from Fashion Rewards. But on the other hand, Fashion Rewards is generating a tremendous amount of top line value for us, and as importantly, long-term customer value. In terms of merchandise margin, our thoughts around that are not to expect any kind of significant increases.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last is on longer term store growth. As you think about the full-line, what is the best way for us to think about it in terms of longer term and are there -- do you see opportunities for potential closings as well?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, in terms of long term, our expectations around full-line are a low single-digit comp overtime. In terms of closings, we periodically evaluate stores as operating agreements do come up. At this point in time, from an economic standpoint, there's nothing that would suggest that we should be proactively closing stores. But if a store happens to be in a situation where the operating agreement is up and we believe there's a better opportunity in the same market, we might make a change there. But nothing material from a store closure basis. And overall, from a full-line standpoint, Canada is a huge opportunity. We tend to talk about full-line in terms of the 4-wall U.S., but long term, Canada has a lot of upside for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm looking at -- I'm wondering about the inventory. It looks like it's up about 18% year-over-year. I'm wondering if the 53rd week had any impact on your year-over-year inventory growth? And how do you think about planning inventory relative to your sales plan, just as we look out to 2013?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. The impact in inventory is not from the 53rd week. It's primarily from the growth in the Rack. Just to give a little color on that, part of our success with the Rack last year is we have taken a more aggressive posture in terms of procuring product for the next season. It's called \"pack and hold\". We're doing it with our top brands. That has been the most significant driver of our inventory increase. If you look at our full-line and Direct business, the turns are roughly even with what they were last year. They were in line with sales. So that is mostly about the Rack.","In terms of next year, our expectation is that growth in the \"pack and hold\" is going to start to moderate. So we should see that growth start to level off as we go forward. And our goal has always been to continue to improve our turns.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, I'm wondering if because of the shift in your Anniversary Sale, from straddling Q2 and Q3, if there will be any sort of quarterly volatility that we should think about in your inventory levels in the -- particularly as we finish Q2 and go into Q3?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, as you recall last year, we had the last week of Anniversary go into August, which means the third quarter benefited from that from a P&L standpoint, but the second quarter saw higher inventory levels, because we still had a full week of Anniversary left. So what you'll see this year is the inventory levels coming out of the second quarter should be down versus last year because we'll have a full week of that high selling within the period.","Operator","Our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about the investments you're making in Direct, and we keep hearing more and more going towards mobile, what are you seeing in terms of mobile purchasing, in terms of pricing? Does it -- is it a different in average transaction or category? And just lastly, on the Fashion Rewards, how are you thinking about Fashion Rewards in terms of SG&A and margin go forward?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Dana. Thanks for your question. In terms of mobile, I think Blake stated in his comments that this past year, we saw 20% of our online volume come from mobile. So we continue to see that as a large channel within the channel for growth. I mean, the growth in people who have smartphones in the next year or 2 is projected to surpass desktop computing. So that's an area that we've invested very strongly, whether it's mobile in the stores with checkout and service or whether it's our iPhone app or our iPad app, we're going to continue to invest in that. And I think long term, it's going to be about creating a more personalized experience, whether you're online or in the store or whether you're using mobile or at a desktop. And those are the areas that we continue to put our investments. And then -- I'm sorry, in terms of the Fashion Rewards, could you please repeat that?","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Sure. How do you see that -- the long-term impact on sales and margins for Fashion Rewards?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Thank you. Well, with the investments we've made in 2012, clearly, our existing customers and new customers love our Fashion Rewards program. And we expect to continue to find ways to deliver more benefits to our customers. This past fall, we tested a non-tender-based program in our cosmetics business. Going forward, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to offer Fashion Rewards to more customers and not just those that choose to have one of our tender. So we think it's terrific for our customers and it builds a long-term loyalty value there.","In terms of its impact to margin, we have seen an impact to that measured in the multiples of 10 basis points. Over time, that should level off, but clearly, it's driving some pretty significant top line growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A question on Fashion Rewards. What percentage of your sales is coming from the Fashion Rewards program? You mentioned 36% on the card, but I assumed that meant your credit card, not Fashion Rewards.","Michael G. Koppel","Well, Richard, just to clarify, all of our current -- all of our Fashion Rewards customers have one of our tenders, whether it's our co-branded Visa, our private label or our debit card. So that 36% is representative of sales on any one of those 3 tenders.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And obviously, it would all be Fashion Rewards then? So that means -- that's helpful.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, yes. That's correct.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you just comment on your efforts to develop the HauteLook business, perhaps efforts to integrate it into your existing businesses, your full-line and your Rack business? And the profit picture for that business longer term?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, last year, HauteLook was able to generate roughly a 40% increase in its sales and very nearly -- near a breakeven, exceeding its bottom line plan. We continue to see opportunities there as we're offering our customers various ways to do business with us, whether it's flash sale, whether it's off-price in the store, regular price online. And we do believe that over time, our ability to use more of the resources available to us to procure more product, to more effectively fulfill product to our customers, utilizing the resources we have at Nordstrom Inc. is going to help the HauteLook model. So going forward, we definitely see opportunities for both companies to take advantage of the strengths that they both have to deliver a better offer to our customer.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I think the comment that the market is likely to focus on the next few weeks, obviously, the EBIT margins over the longer term and the next few years, because of all the investments you guys see.","Michael G. Koppel","Yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As we look out to the out years, for those of us that are modeling the business, there's an opportunity for sales growth to accelerate based on these opportunities? Or do we need to think about the out year estimates trending and it seems like the earnings estimates trending, call it in the high single-digit range?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Well, as of right now, our goals are to increase top line sales at high single-digit and return on capital in the mid-teens. We believe that over time, that's going to generate value. If we're fortunate enough that we achieve those sales, then we might get more leverage out of that. But right now, that is what our focus, and it's tough to see anything clearer than that in the moment.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if could you just help me think about the -- understanding the leverage a little bit, maybe between the channels? I guess, since you mentioned that your comp buildup is based on e-commerce at 20% growth, that's well below last year. The growth rate, as it gets bigger, it's a bigger piece of the mix, obviously harder to grow, but you're still putting a lot of investment power behind it. So as that part of the business drives some upside on sales, is -- Mike, is that when you would start saying you'd start to think about a little bit higher leverage in our models?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, frankly, all channels -- an improvement in sales in all channels is going to deliver leverage, not just the Direct model. We've had years where we've had some very strong comps in our full-line stores and our Direct stores, where we're generating leverage. As a matter of fact, right now, in '12 and plan for '13 is we generated operating leverage in our traditional 4-wall channels. So we don't expect that not to be the case. But when you're investing at the level we are as it relates to a brand-new channel offering like Direct, as it relates to a brand-new market like Canada, those kinds of things are going to require multiple years of investments in order to get there. And that -- subsequent to that, I think time will tell as to whether or not we get leverage long term.","Operator","And our final question today is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess my main question is, does this sort of change in your CapEx plan over the next couple of years? It must change your viewpoint on sort of buybacks and dividends. I mean, I know you have historically managed dividends through kind of a payout ratio. Is that still the way to think about it? And how should we think about buybacks?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, Liz. Well, thanks for the question. Our framework around our capital allocation is not changing. We still look at that 25% to 30% dividend payout ratio. That's still part of our decision-making. In terms of repurchase of stock, we still do that based on an approach that looks at long-term value -- long-term fair value of the company. So at this point in time, we don't see that having our capital plans negatively impacting those policies. Now of course, that's all based on current course and speed. If there's any significant change in the economy that we can't foresee, those are clearly levers.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)","I will now introduce Rob Campbell, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin, sir.","Rob Campbell","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include about 30 minutes for your questions. As we get started, I'd like to refer you to the slide showing our Safe Harbor Language regarding forward-looking statements.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's second quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2014.","Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Direct.","Before we begin, I want to mention that Blake and Mike will be using slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations tab.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake Nordstrom","Thank you, Rob. As has been customary over these last couple of quarters, we think it's important to start by talking about our strategy. You'll note on the first slide that it's got the customers squarely in the middle. And though that may sound or appear simple, it really is critical for our business and it provides clarity as we think about allocating capital and leadership talent to the various opportunities to serve the customer in the manner they expect from Nordstrom.","Second quarter is important for our company and is materially different than many other retailers due to the anniversary sale, which is a unique event within our industry and one that over the years our team continues to build upon. Before touching on our anniversary, for the second quarter, total sales were up 6.2%. And on a comp store basis, we had 3.3% increase. For the anniversary event, we saw an increase of 3.6%. This was in line with our plans and slightly ahead of our trend of the last 18 months and as well as last year's anniversary sale.","In addition, I want to talk about new store openings in the third quarter. We have three full line stores coming, including a second store in Houston, one in Jacksonville, Florida. And we're particularly excited about our first store in Canada in Calgary opening on September 19th. A lot of work has gone into it. And we recognize how important this is for the company and we're anxious for the opportunity to start serving customers in Canada. And finally, our rack continues to grow at a good clip. We've opened 11 stores so far year-to-date. And for this fall, we have 16 more stores planned to open.","I would like to talk about the recent announcement of the acquisition of Trunk Club. Trunk Club is a terrific business and one that we've been monitoring for some time. This area of the business is an area that a number of customers are interested in and we've been super-impressed with the five years that Trunk Club and their team have been focused on the business on what they've been able to accomplish.","With our strategy that I talked about earlier, it's less about acquisition and it's all about the customer and how we can best serve her\/him. So whether that's partnering, working on something internally or doing an acquisition to improve our capabilities, that's the focus and the filtering lens that we use. As we look at Trunk Club, there was something that we felt was important to some of our customers. We have a dominant men's business and by layering in Trunk Club, it really allows us to service more customers in the manner they'd like to be served. It's something we felt we could do. But they had made tremendous progress. And one of the key elements in our business is speed. And we felt given it would probably take a year or two for us to take a sizeable portion of capital and some of our leadership team to get this business up and running that we were best served acquiring Trunk Club to get up and running asap.","There's a number of synergies that Mike is going to go through. I guess I would add in addition to those synergies on both sides that for our executive team that was involved with the due diligence, we really loved taken by the culture that Brian Spaly and his team have worked on. It really resonates with ours. It's focused on the customer. It's high touch. It's a full price business. And they have a strong pay-for-performance culture there that really resonates with us. So we're excited about the connection with Trunk Club and look forward to over time sharing with you how that best serves our customer and how that's a good fit for our business.","I'd now like to turn it over to Mike, so that he can give you more specifics both on Trunk Club and the quarter.","Mike Koppel","Thanks, Blake. This quarter demonstrated our continued focus on the execution of our current business, while looking forward and building our capabilities for the future. The customers' view of a great service experience is rapidly evolving and we believe strongly in serving customers on their terms.","The acquisition of Trunk Club represents our most recent example, providing an innovative way of serving customers. The transaction aligns with our strategic priorities of accelerating our speed to market, increasing relevance with customers and strengthening our capabilities. We believe there are synergies between our companies that will generate significant long-term growth by enhancing the customer experience. We are very excited about the opportunity in partnering with such an exciting and innovative team.","Before providing details of the acquisition, we'd first like to provide some additional color on our current performance. Our second quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Earnings per diluted share of $0.95 increased 2.2% over the last year. Our results include planned investments and our entry into Canada this fall.","Sales trends were generally consistent with the first quarter. We achieved total sales growth of 6.2%. Comparable sales in our full price business increased 2.7%. The rack continues to deliver accelerated sales growth of 18% with comparable sales increasing 4%. Our gross profit rate decreased 7 basis points from last year, primarily due to higher occupancy expenses related to rack's growth. The heightened promotional environment that we experienced in the first quarter moderated over the last several months, resulting in comparable gross margin rates versus last year.","On a square footage basis, ending inventory growth of 19% over the last year outpaced sales growth of roughly 3%. This was driven primarily from planned growth in our off-price business with Nordstrom rack and the recent launch of Nordstromrack.com. The growth of these businesses is creating additional opportunities for us to procure great product. The increases in inventory also reflect planned investments in our full price business, including fueling growth online and funding well performing merchandise categories. As we exit the quarter, our inventory is current and at an appropriate level to support the business.","With respect to expenses, our SG&A rate increased by 66 basis points over the last year, largely driven by planned fulfillment and technology investments and the upcoming entry into Canada. In addition, last year's results included a reduction in variable expenses associated with company performance.","Now we'd like to provide additional color on the Trunk Club transaction and the opportunities we see. We have entered into an agreement to acquire the company for $300 million payable in Nordstrom stock, a portion of which is retention-based and subject to vesting. In addition, we established a long-term management incentive plan of up to $100 million based on Trunk Club's performance. Achievement of any portion of this plan will result in significant upside value. We expect the acquisition to be dilutive to earnings per share over the next several years largely as a result of share issuance, performance incentives and amortization of intangibles.","Based on preliminary numbers, we estimate the dilutive EPS impact to be 3% to 5% in the current year. We plan to provide more details after we close the transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter.","As to our strategic rationale supporting the acquisition, there were several considerations in assuring that the business fit was in our core strategy. First is speed to market. Although we have some of the elements necessary to develop this offering, it would have taken us several years to match the level of execution of Trunk Club. Their business has been solely dedicated and very successful at serving customers in this differentiated way for the last five years. We believe that speed matters, generating value from our rapid entry into this market along with access to a customer base that is incremental to those we serve today.","Second, Trunk Club has successfully built the foundation that can support its independent growth, while allowing for additional opportunities in partnership with our business. We are looking at how we can combine our collective learnings and capabilities in a way that allows us to serve customers more fully across our business.","Third, we found the financial profile of Trunk Club to be attractive. The business delivered positive operating cash flow in 2013 and is on track this year to achieve over $100 million in annual sales and reach operating profitability. With the projected topline increase of roughly 150% in 2014, Trunk club is expected to sustain outsized growth due expansion of its existing channels of Trunk's showrooms and custom fitting events.","Trunk Club will largely operate independently over the near term, which is similar to the approach we've taken with HauteLook. That said, Trunk Club will be able to immediately scale its business by leveraging our operational capabilities, which include supply chain, greater breadth in inventory and in-store alterations. Erik Nordstrom will lead these efforts partnering with various business leaders.","Before I talk about the 2014 outlook, I'd just like to make a slight correction. I believe I said that the initial purchase price was $300 million. It's $350 million. Thank you. Now let's turn to our 2014 outlook.","We remain on track and have narrowed our full year earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $3.80 to $3.90. This incorporates our second quarter results as well as the full year impact of share repurchases to date, but excludes the acquisition of Trunk Club, which is expected to reduce earnings per share by 3% to 5%.","Our topline expectations reflect total sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and a comparable sales increase of 3% to 4%. Finally, the process regarding the potential sale of our credit card receivables is going as planned. As we shared with you last quarter, we expect the process to take a total 12 to 18 months. We'll provide an update once this process is complete.","In wrapping up the first half of the year, we are encouraged with our progress, executing both our current operations and strategic initiatives with the overarching goal of delivering a superior customer experience.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Rob Campbell","Thank you, Mike. Before taking the first question, we want to ask that each person ask one question and if necessary one follow-up in order to give as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ed Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets","You have a tremendous amount of insight into the US consumer, given your various banners and price points. I guess the high end has been very resilient. Are you starting to see some of those upper middle income and middle income consumers beginning to heal? And then two as a follow-up, in terms of the Canada launch, is there anything we should think about in terms of expense cadence for 3Q and 4Q?","Mike Koppel","In terms of the health of the consumer, our trends have been pretty consistent. If you look at since the beginning of the year, we've been in that 3% to 4% range and while there's been some macro news in terms of the health of the consumer, I think the way the consumer is behaving certainly in our space continues to be relatively consistent.","In terms of Canada, I think we shared previously that Canada would have roughly a $35 million impact to our earnings this year. Through the first half of the year, we've incurred roughly one-third of that and we expect the other two-thirds to be incurred in the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Swinand with Morningstar Equity Research.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Equity Research","It looks like about $0.15 dilution on the acquisition. Is that mostly on the share issuance and including the $100 million in sales, but even breakeven operating margin? Or how should we think about that?","Mike Koppel","The first thing I'll say is that we haven't finalized all the details. Hopefully we expect to close this quarter in the third quarter. And when we get all that, we'll certainly disclose those details. But it really a combination directionally of several tranches. One is the issuance of stock this year. Another is the amortization of intangibles after we finish the accounting and another would be the estimate of any performance against the long-term incentive plan.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Equity Research","The amortization obviously would be non-cash, but that would be spread out over a few years?","Mike Koppel","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","You've obviously now made a nice acquisition to supplement or complement your men's apparel side of the business, but you've also made some great strides on the women's apparel side. I wonder if you could update us on how you think that's doing along with the juniors business, which is now under the same leadership. So just an update on where you are in the women's side of the business.","Pete Nordstrom","As you've mentioned, we now have leadership that really spans the entire breadth of what we do in women's from juniors all the way through designer. That wasn't always the case. And I think what we've learned over time going to appreciate is the dynamics are very similar kind of end-to-end. And the best way for us to be successful is really the synergy of how it all goes together. And so that's new and it's not going to represent a huge change, but I think over time it will help us leverage our strength better.","More specifically with regards to women's, we've had really good growth still with Topshop. It's really an important part of our ongoing plan to be meaningful to that younger fashion contemporary customer. We have 52 stores with Topshop. We will be growing that. I don't have any specific plans to tell you exactly, but we're aligned with our friends at Topshop to continue to grow this business and there's more opportunity for us there. And the good news about that is that that's not really measured in isolation.","We have Topshop in the store and we have success. It's really kind of lifting all boats in the women's apparel. So I would say generally we've had good progress at women's. We're happy about our plans there and we feel like we'll continue to have growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","I wanted to follow-up on the growth in inventory this quarter and specifically the planned growth in full price. Is that just new stores, or is that making that's in other categories?","Mike Koppel","The full price primarily is the growth in direct. We continue to see that business growing in the mid to high-20s range. And so that's the continuing funding of that business. We do have some new stores that we plan to open, but the impact on the overall inventory levels at this point is relatively minor.","Pete Nordstrom","We did make a purposeful increase in inventory plans related to specifically the cosmetic division where we feel like we're returning a little too fast and maybe we were out of stock. And as we've done that, it's really helped improve the business. And in fact, cosmetics is the top comp sales division for us year-to-date. So that's been a purposeful investment in what we're doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","I just wanted to follow-up on Lorraine's question on inventory. I know that you have been building inventory for the last several years for all the various initiatives you have. Is it your view that we should just continue to expect inventory to grow to outpace sales growth into the future? And does that mean that a slower level of inventory turnover is what you expect going forward? Or do think we'll get some sort of the normalization in Q4, six, eight quarters where you would start to see revenue actually outpace your inventory growth?","Mike Koppel","Our overarching goal is always to improve the GMROI on our inventory. And clearly, one of the components of that is turn. That said, as we've expanded our off-price business, we've launched Nordstromrack.com and I think as we've done a more integrated approach with our top brands and procuring product, we've been able to do a much better job in the marketplace at being the first ones at the table to get the best product. And the pack-and-hold has been something we continue to invest in. And clearly what you're seeing there has been some great opportunities for us to get the best off-price product out there that we believe will certainly continue to drive those sales in the off-price space.","We don't expect that over the long run that it's going to continue to outpace the sales. But clearly we're going through this inflection point as we've adjusted some of our operating techniques and our strategic that we are able to accelerate the growth of the inventory.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Just wanted to ask about the performance of the Nordstrom Rack as well as HauteLook and Nordstrom.com, just get some breakdown amongst those websites' performance in 2Q.","Blake Nordstrom","The question is about Nordstromrack.com?","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, just about each of your website banners, the performance on what you saw.","Erik Nordstrom","One of the great values of HauteLook acquisitions and the launch and the support of Nordstromrack.com on their platform and that team did a terrific job of making that happen very, very quickly. So very happy with the speed of that. Our integration of rack and HauteLook to Nordstromrack.com, there's a couple that we really benefited from. One is on the technology and getting it quicker to the merchandise. As our team is able to go to market, the story in the marketplace, the value of the vendors these different businesses and the synergy it creates is really resonating. So our quality of the content is starting to be more and more influenced by our rack merchandising team. So our merchandising teams of rack and HauteLook are working together.","The content is just starting to come. Up to now, the bigger chunk has been from the HauteLook. So we're still learning a lot with Nordstromrack.com. We're pleased with the launch there, but we've got lots of opportunity to get better. The HauteLook business itself has been very consistent from the demand standpoint, running about 30% increase in demand. What's changed for us is the return rate. Again, this goes to integration points of why we like the HauteLook business. In the last year that we started taking HauteLook returns in our rack stores, and over 70% of HauteLook returns are now coming physically to our rack stores, customers coming to our rack stores. It is a better customer experience. I think it separates HauteLook from other flash sale competitors. And it's a tremendous traffic driver for our rack stores.","So within HauteLook silo, the return rate has gone up quite a bit, hurting their sales. But overall for the company, it's a clear win for us. As far as Nordstrom.com's performance, I guess the biggest difference in first quarter and second quarter were the amount of promotional activity. First quarter, the industry was having more promotional activity and we're matching price. We saw a fairly significant increase in demand and also the corresponding reduction in gross margin. Second quarter, not as much promotional activity, so we didn't get the lift in demand, but we also didn't get the hit to the gross margin.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","As we move into the second half of the year, obviously tough to gauge the competitive response going forward. But just help us understand what your thought is on gross margins and promotional intensity for 3Q specifically. I mean there was a big gap between your first quarter and second quarter gross margin performance. Is the thought to expect the second half to be somewhere in between?","Mike Koppel","Our guidance reflects our expectations as to how we feel about our ability to achieve our margin. We definitely saw the first quarter was impacted by some pretty severe weather patterns coming out of the winter season that caused a lot of promotions in the first quarter. We saw that moderate in the second quarter. We clearly are very conscious of what's going on out there. But I think if you look at what we're guiding for the back half of the year, I think that says how we feel about it. One other thing I'll add to about the direct performance, if you look at both the first and second quarter on a two-year basis, we're up almost 60%, almost equally in both quarters. So we continue to see that business operating at our expectations, which is roughly that mid to high 20s comp.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","","Regarding your prior and your current outlook, the tweak in the comp store sales, taking towards the high-end as well as editing the gross profit on basis points, what were the main dynamics that drove those changes? And a follow-up was on the full line comps. What would you prioritize as the biggest opportunity just to see improvement in that business?","Mike Koppel","In terms of the adjustments, it really just reflects the fact that we got two quarters behind us now. And there's more certainty and clarity into what the year is going to look like. There's nothing more in those adjustments other than that.","Blake Nordstrom","One thing I want to remind you when we talk about the full line business is that we have a customer strategy, not a channel strategy. So we do have a number of things we're working on and opportunities we're pretty encouraged about to improve our service and improve our productivity within our full line stores. But the line between where the demand occurs and where the sale gets reported is so blurred today and the expectations the customers have around the service that they want are so dynamic that we're really looking at how we serve customers in the future that it's not about what we really need to do this thing in our full line stores to get the comps go in that channel. We need to look at our entire business and say how can we provide a better customer service and hopefully drive more customers into our stores.","Erik mentioned returns going into our rack stores. That's a great example of things that we can do that might not make one P&L for one business, but different or better in another one, but it's a win for the customers. So we're really focused on those things and again really encouraged by number of opportunities we got in front of us to improve service there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Black with Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black - Jennifer Black & Associates","Congratulations on solid business trends. It appeared that you had much more as far as full price merchandise on the floor during anniversary sale, and I wondered if that was correct and if customers responded favorably to the merchandise assortment. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about what you think your areas of opportunity are for next year's anniversary sale?","Pete Nordstrom","I don't know that we actually had more literally in terms of regular priced inventory, but we're definitely conscious of how important it is to have new regular priced inventory when there's that many people in the stores. So I know that there's always efforts that we have to have a good regular priced offering. And I can tell you the divisions that did the best are the ones that were able to not only have good sale merchandise, but have a good flow of new regular priced. So that's certainly part of our strategy.","I think one thing that we did a particularly good job this year and this has been a theme for us for the last couple, I think we've done a good job with our loyal regular Nordstrom customers in making this event as appealing as possible and convenient and easy for them. And that certainly showed in our results. I think the opportunity for us going forward is while we continue to do that that we also spread the word and try to raise the word with customers that are maybe more casual Nordstrom customers or acquisition type customers at what a great event this is and why it's special and different. And there is a lot of opportunity with that specifically. So that's I think something we're trying to layer on for next year and that should help us grow the event.","Blake Nordstrom","Jennifer, one thing to add to Pete's comments there is in the second quarter, as we've seen this whole year, is we're acquiring customers in our rewards program at an accelerating rate. In the second quarter, I think we were up about 18% in terms of new rewards customers. So that continues to be an opportunity for us, as Pete said, to continue to engage customers at a higher level and also introduce new customers to our brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Just a couple questions on the rack stores. Is there anything more recently that you've been seeing that gives you increased confidence in that 230 store target for the long term? And then also in terms of category performance, do the rack stores have the same category successes that the full line stores do, or are there any differences there?","Blake Nordstrom","Regarding the current 230 store goal or objective we've had for 2016, we are close. At this juncture, we could fall short. What we are finding is there some cyclical nature to it in terms of availability of the stores. So one year, we might have plan to have 25 store openings and we might fall short of that. And the next year we might come up above that. But I think from a long term point of view, we feel really good about the growth of the rack and the opportunities there, but there could be some nuances that we may not be exactly at 230 at that time. But I think over time, we'll hit that number and continue to go forward with that.","In terms of category performance, our racks do mirror the full line stores and the customer is desirous of the same passion and trends. And so there is a correlation if the full line stores have a category that it tends to correspondence well within the racks. So there is a complementary approach there. And we said earlier too and I would just reiterate that general merchandise managers are just doing a terrific job working with our vendors and enhancing our partnership and looking at the four areas of our strategy. And the vendors are more and more thinking of us first and when it comes to close out, it's really helping our rack business. So we are really encouraged with the quality of product that we're able to provide for our customers.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","","I had a question on the inventory. I was wondering if you could comment a little more on the pack-away inventory, categories that you've seen. And it seems like just the magnitude, that's one of the larger ones that we've seen over the years in terms of the commitment that you've made there.","Mike Koppel","Well, Bob, we're really not going to break down by category of what that looks like. But suffice it to say, we continue to believe that it's providing us with great opportunity. And I think the other thing to keep in mind about that too is I think we got 16 rack stores that we're opening next quarter. So that's also an element of the growth of that investment. But it's relatively broad in terms of the opportunities.","Blake Nordstrom","There is really kind of three elements or drivers to access to products. It's from our full line stores that transfers its close out merchandise from our top vendors and its ability to have when there is a void make up some product as well. Again, I've mentioned earlier in the previous question we're really encouraged. We are getting more, more first call and more access to great product as time goes on. So as we have gotten larger with scale, it's really helped in this pack-and-hold ability to be able to go to our top vendors and be able to buy all the product they have in this season and then hold it for a couple of months and then bring it in our stores. It provides much better flow, better sizes and again more trend-right merchandise. So it's been a real win, win.","It does impact in the short run kind of apples and oranges comparison, i.e., what we had in pack-and-hold last year versus this year. And as Mike said, some of that's driven by the new store opening cadence. And that's a key point of filling those stores at that right part. We use pack-and-hold. But at this juncture, we're really encouraged about that avenue of product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","I'm curious about a couple of things with Trunk Club, since it'll probably be a focus here for the next few weeks. I'm curious about your comment about how you said there was an opportunity to speed to market and maybe a little bit about why you felt the urgency to get into that category right now.","Erik Nordstrom","We've been looking at that business model for the last couple of years in particular. And it's just smack dab in the middle of what we do. It's about fashion, the guy who wants to look good and who appreciates high level of service. What's complementary to what we do, because those are two things that are foundation, is the guy who doesn't want to go to the store. Either he doesn't have time to go to a store or simply doesn't like going to stores. And they use a multichannel offer to do that. That is in so many ways close to what we do. Yet, it's complementary. I think we purchased HauteLook that while we're in the off-price business, we concluded that this flash sale model was of significant scale and that certain customers certainly liked it. And it wasn't why it's for us to try to force them into the one off-price model. If we had it, why it's for us to offer the customer the choice that they want. That's very similar here. It's another way of serving customers that's about fashion, it's about great service. Yet it is different from what we do.","So the model got us more excited. We looked at it. And it's something that we feel that category is going to grow, that we're uniquely positioned to be a leader in it. But if we didn't do it, someone else would and would take a bigger chunk. It's pretty clear where we can help them through things inventory, supply chain, intraoperations, things like that right off the bat that we can add appeal to their growth.","And then it's also clear that our two companies are better together than separate. Things like even contemplating expanding that service to women's would be very daunting for either one of us to do it on our own. Combined we're well positioned to test things like that. And we just thing there's tremendous upside going forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Of the $0.15, I think that's backed us out to about $45 million in cost, how much of that is ongoing versus costs that will roll off like amortization? If you could help us break that down and then maybe why the decision to pay in stock for the acquisition.","Mike Koppel","We'll give more visibility into that as we get to the closure. But suffice it to say, the business currently in 2014 and going forward is at an operating profit. And we expect that to continue to expand as time moves forward. In terms of some of the non-cash related items, we will see those start to pare off after the first couple of years. But we'll give you more detail as we get to the closing process.","And then I think the second part was why stock, stock was just currency that made sense for both parties. And it helped to facilitate us to get the deal done. So clearly, it also fits within our overall capital policy in terms of how we manage our capital. So it's frankly kind of a moot point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA","What are you doing to announce your arrival in Canada, anything special? Could you bring us up-to-date on performance in denim and women's active?","Jamie Nordstrom","We're opening our first store in Canada on September 19th and our team up there has been very active in the community for a number of months. Clearly there has been some hiring that's been going on as we build that team. And Calgary is a great county. We've been sponsoring things. We sponsored the big breakfast up there where we feed 50,000 people breakfast on one morning. And what we're really trying to do is wherever we've opened stores, which is really try to learn what's important to the community, so that we can be part of the community. We're only opening one store in Canada this year. And our entire team at Nordstrom is focused on getting it right. And so we want to make sure that we're listening to the customers up there and we're doing everything we can to make sure that when we open our doors there in a few weeks that we make a great first impression.","Denim, both in women's and men's is solid. It's pretty solid. I wouldn't say it's spectacular. But I think it's fair to describe is pretty good and at least a plan for us. So it's a healthy part of the business. In terms of women's active, we have had a lot of discussions around here recently about that. And we've had some really outstanding growth in particular with our Zella brand that's an MPG brand that we do ourselves. It's been quite good and I think it's reflective of not only how great that product is, but the opportunity it represents more broadly in that category. So it's a hot topic around here. We're talking about ways that we can continue to add on to that momentum. So yeah, it's a very positive part of our women's business right now.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA","What percentage of your customers shop full line store and rack both?","Mike Koppel","Roughly 30%, Barbara.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","I was wondering if Erik and Jamie would lay in a little bit with their job switch and any sort of key learnings that they would like to share that might be impacting strategy. Where exactly did those rack.com sales go? Are they in the direct number that's up 22% or the rack number that's up 18%?","Jamie Nordstrom","The main reason behind Erik's job switch is that we felt we could do a better job as an organization in being customer-centric. I think we've made a lot of progress over the last probably decade in being really focused on customers and how they want to shop and investing capabilities to serve them on their terms. But Erik and I over the last year or so really felt that we were kind of hitting a bit of glass ceiling in terms of organizationally how we were able to get after some of the stuff. And to put it simply, in some ways, we weren't being very customer-centric. We were actually being channel-centric. And our customer doesn't care about channels. You never hear a customer say the word channel. And Erik and I felt that by us switching jobs, we could support our teams more effective to get after some of these bigger ideas that we think are out there in terms of whether it's how customers are shopping on their phones or all the things that happen in between a website and a store that frankly is where the magic is. And we've got some big ideas of how we can improve our business in the future. We think we're pretty well positioned and Erik and I are really excited about how we can better support our team towards those goals.","Erik Nordstrom","While I've been a keen observer from outsider, it's being there day to day. It's a very impressive team. Especially the last three years, Jamie's team added a lot of people, many from outside the company that have capabilities we didn't have, pure e-commerce capabilities that the team is very impressive. And they're experienced in e-commerce and it's a very well run e-commerce business. But I would echo Jamie's comments, we have to keep doing that and progressing on those e-commerce specific capabilities. But we feel there is another level to get to with leveraging our capabilities across the channels. And that's something eight to nine months before we did the switch. Jamie and I worked more together than we ever had. And that's just continued after the switch, and we think there's some tremendous opportunities for us to serve customers in better ways that I'm not sure anyone else can, given the different businesses we're in. And Trunk Club is an example that we can serve customers and that it fits in between the silos of businesses. And that's where we think the big opportunities are.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Rack.com sales, do they show up on the direct line, which was up 22% in the quarter, or did they show up in the rack division sales, which was up 18% overall.","Mike Koppel","It's in total HauteLook.","Operator","And our final question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","I just had one point of clarification. I think you said something like the gross and direct was due to merchandise availability. I didn't really catch that. Could you just flush that out for us a little bit?","Mike Koppel","I think what we're implying is that we continue to expand the selection and the product offering that's driving more business.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Does that mean there's been some sort of slowdown in traffic or conversion? Is it just less dropped baskets or less unavailable merchandise?","Mike Koppel","No, yeah.","Rob Campbell","Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call along with our slide presentation will be available for one year on the Investor Relations section of nordstrom.com under Webcast.

We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.","During today's call the company does not plan to comment further on the expiration by the Nordstrom family of the possibility of a going private transaction or the process. Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President; and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's fourth quarter performance and the guidance for 2018. Joining during the Q&A session will be Erik Nordstrom, Co-President; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started on our results, we'd like to take a moment to provide context on our journey ahead as we aspire to be the best fashion retailer. Our customer strategy is centered on three strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering; delivering exceptional services and experiences; and leveraging the strength of our brand.","As we continue to evolve with customers, we're combining our digital and physical assets to create new ways for them to shop. We invested early in our omnichannel capabilities integrating our inventory across our stores and online over a decade ago. This has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways. Today we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Through these investments, we have strengthened our foundation to better serve customers and gain market share.","Turning to our performance in 2017, we had record sales of approximately $15 billion. This represented annualized growth of 5% over the last five years reflecting the investments we've made to expand our reach and improve the customer experience. We're encouraged by a number of key achievements over the past year. First, we continue to see positive customer trends. At the close of 2017, we had 33 million customers who shop with us during the year. Additionally, 9 million customers shopped in multiple ways, a 6% increase over the previous year. It's noteworthy that customers spend nearly 70% more when shopping us with through multiple touchpoints.","In our Nordstrom business, we made meaningful progress in meeting customers' expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We offer a number of ways to serve them on their terms seamlessly across stores and online. Our services such as Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store, Reserve Online & Try In Store, and Style Board grew by more than 30% over last year. Nordstrom Local is a recent example of how we are testing new ways to engage and provide customers with convenient access to our service offerings. And our accelerated investments in our digital platform continue to pay off with digital sales representing 30% of our full-price business.","Nordstrom.com has 700 million annual site visits offering expanded selection in key brands and categories. Our Nordstrom Rack business continues to be our leading source of customer acquisition, gaining 6 million new customers in 2017. Over time, about one-third of our off-price customers cross-shop in our full-price business. In addition, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook represent our fastest growing business to reach $1 billion. In 2017 it accounted for 18% of off-price sales and had new customer growth of 45%. Its integrated digital and physical experiences led to 85% of online returns being made in store, which drove more than 4 million store trips in 2017.","We continue to evolve and grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice. Benefits of this strategy include creating a source of newness and discovery for customers, strengthening regular price selling and driving long-term collaborations with preferred brands. These brands, including designer, product with limited distribution and our private label delivered outsized sales growth of 14% in 2017 with healthy gross margins.","Over 60% of full-price brands have limited promotional exposure, a 17 percentage point improvement from two years ago. Our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program continues to drive engagement while providing valuable customer insights. In May 2016, we expanded our program so that all our customers can participate regardless of how they choose to pay. We continue to reap the benefits with more than 10 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of 35% year-over-year.","As we look ahead to 2018, we're executing on our strategic pillars through a series of initiatives. First, we're excited to announce that we'll be opening the doors to our Men's New York City store on April 12. Together, with our Women's store, which is slated to open in fall 2019, this flagship is our largest project to-date. We expect this store to be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand serving as a gateway to new customers both in the U.S. and internationally.","It will be our highest volume store in one of our top markets. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in a new market, we also expect this store to drive a material lift to online sales and market share gains.","Second, we're focusing on further integrating our digital and physical assets in our top markets to deliver best-in-class services and experiences. We will bring our capabilities together across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to create a digitally connected and differentiated experience for customers to shop on their terms.","We're starting our integration in L.A., our largest market where we serve 4 million customers online and through our local assets including 16 full-line stores, 27 Nordstrom Racks, distribution and fulfillment centers, Nordstrom Local and Trunk Club. We believe that we will gain terrific learnings from our experience in L.A. that we could apply to other markets.","Another key initiative for 2018 is the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada where we completed our full-line store expansion plans with our sixth store opening in Sherway Gardens, Toronto last September. This year we're planning to open six Nordstrom Rack stores in the Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, and Ottawa areas.","Similar to our experience in the U.S., we expect strong synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses, and plan to grow our total Canada business to $1 billion.","Finally, we'll continue to curate our assortment to provide newness and the opportunity for discovery for our customers. In our full-price business our focus is on strategic brand growth through new launches and our existing partners. In our off-price business, leveraging our vendor partnerships enables us to offer the best brands at the best prices.","We have made meaningful progress in laying the groundwork to better serve customers and look forward to our opportunities. We believe we have unmatched local market assets, our people, product and place, that combined with the strength of our digital capabilities make us uniquely positioned in the market.","I'll now turn the call over to Anne who will provide additional insights into our financial performance and thoughts about the year ahead.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position marking the ninth consecutive year of generating more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. We had a strong finish to the year. For 2017, total sales growth increased 4.4% increased, and comps increased 0.8% which were slightly ahead of our expectations.","In our Nordstrom brand, fourth quarter sales reflected both favorable store trends and double digit online growth. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we had a meaningful improvement from the third quarter, a direct result of our focused efforts to provide good inventory flow and fashion right merchandise.","Fourth quarter retail gross profit was down roughly 40 basis points from the prior year due to occupancy expenses associated with our growth plans. Merchandise margins were consistent with both our expectations and the prior year, reflecting continued strength in our regular price selling. Ending inventory of 7% was in line with our plan and included a shift in timing of in-transit receipts. When normalizing for this, inventory growth was consistent with sales growth.","Our SG&A rate increased approximately 240 basis points which included roughly 90 basis points of non-operational items. We had a onetime contribution to our employee profit-sharing plan associated with tax reform as well as legal settlement gain in 2016. The remaining increase primarily reflected planned supply chain, marketing and technology expenses.","We reported EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year. The impacts associated with tax reform were not contemplated in our prior outlook. This consisted of a onetime charge of $0.25 primarily related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, we made an investment to employees of $0.06 mentioned earlier. Our results also included year-end adjustments to our incentives based on our top line performance, bringing earnings to the lower end of our expectations.","Now I'd like to provide our perspective on how we're measuring success as our business model continues to evolve. The economics of serving customers are greatly enhanced by having combined digital and physical assets in a given market.","In our full-price business, we have a high-quality portfolio of around 120 full-line stores in roughly 50 markets across the U.S. In these markets, the profit per customer is more than double that of markets without a Nordstrom store presence. This market-focused approach informs how we allocate capital, leverage our capabilities and measure our success.","As we've previously shared over the past several quarters, we're increasingly managing our business primarily through two brands, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, rather than by channel. This includes migrating our metrics from a legacy store view to those that are more relevant to how customers are engaging with us. We continue to further align our incentives based on markets rather than individual channels.","Beginning in 2018, we will make a number of reporting changes and introduce additional metrics around our customer and market performance as indicators of the underlying health of our business. These changes, which are outlined in today's release, will impact our segment and sales reporting.","Specifically, this means that we will be allocating our credit business to our full-price and off-price businesses. Additionally, our sales reporting will represent a combined stores and online view, and will include allocated corporate adjustments such as estimated sales returns. As the year progresses, we will be providing clarity and transparency to help make this reporting transition go smoothly.","Next, I'd like to discuss our path forward to achieving long term profitable growth. We have now reached a point where our full-price digital business is at a scale in which costs to serve customers are comparable across our stores and online channels. This year we are planning for a turning point in improved profitability as we scale our generational investments and leverage our enterprise capabilities.","In 2017, generational investments in Canada, HauteLook and Trunk Club contributed roughly $1.5 billion in sales. As these investments continue to scale, we anticipate profit improvements.","We accelerated investments in our foundational capabilities for supply chain, technology and marketing, resulting in an annualized expense growth of approximately 20% from 2010 to 2015 in these areas. Over the past two years we have cut this growth in half through our focused effort to drive productivity and plan to further reduce it to a mid-single digit range in 2018.","We're planning to maintain our marketing expense as a rate to sales, focusing on personalization at scale through our data and analytics capabilities. With the speed and agility enabled by our modernized technology infrastructure, we expect to incur cash spend of $525 million towards technology, consistent with the prior year. And in supply chain we have maintained our cost per unit with further opportunity to optimize our network.","Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2018 guidance. Our EPS range of $3.30 to $3.55 includes a benefit from corporate tax reform of around $0.55 partially offset by an EBIT reduction from revenue recognition changes of approximately $30 million. In terms of top line performance, we expect a continuation of underlying trends yielding total sales of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion and comps of 0.5% to 1.5%. This incorporates sales from generational investments of roughly $1.8 billion in 12 new Nordstrom Rack stores, 6 in the U.S. and 6 in Canada. Our gross profit rate assumes modest improvement in merchandise margins.","Occupancy expenses as a rate to sales are expected to be relatively consistent with last year with higher expenses in the first half due to timing of new store openings. Preopening expenses for our New York City flagship are estimated to be $25 million in 2018, consistent with 2017. Additionally, SG&A expense growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From an EBIT perspective, these drivers are expected to result in flat to a slight improvement in margin rate at the midpoint of our guidance.","The 2017 estimated EPS impact of the 53rd week is approximately $0.05. Our income tax rate including state and local taxes is estimated at around 27.5%, down from 39% due to tax reform. Given the impacts related to the 53rd week, tax reform, revenue recognition and event shifts, please refer to the appendix section in today's slides for additional color.","Moving to our capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.2 billion over the next five years, or 4% of sales. Technology and supply chain are key enablers of the customer experience, representing nearly 50% of our plan. Canada and our New York City flagship investments making up 17% will moderate as they near completion. For 2018, net CapEx is expected to be approximately $740 million, an increase of $70 million from 2017, primarily due to our New York City flagship and the buildout of an additional West Coast fulfillment center which shifted from 2017.","In closing, our strategic brand partnerships and combined digital and physical assets make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We believe our diversified and resilient business model will continue to serve us well while creating value for our shareholders, customers and employees.","And now I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Again, we'd like to remind you that we will not be commenting on the privatization. We'll now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. A very helpful presentation. The turning point plan in 2018 is really remarkable in terms of taking a stand now here. The environment is still very dynamic with Amazon and mobile and voice and digital. So what's context for why this is the right time to do this? And what kind of underpins your feelings that improvement is here and will happen? Thank you.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks, Oliver. This is Anne. So, there's a couple of things. As you look at our guidance, and I'll take it in different sections, so for the sales part of our guidance, we're really being very consistent with what we've seen with trends over the last several quarters. So we don't feel like we are \u2013 even though the industry is in disruption, we feel like we're being pretty consistent with what we've seen in the top line of the business.","The two biggest components of where we're getting that turning point is, one, we've got our generational investments starting to come online. As Blake mentioned, we're opening our New York Men's store this year and additionally we continue to open our Rack stores in Canada and continue to get scale and productivity out of those investments. The second component is we've been investing for a long time really ahead of the curve in our core capabilities to serve our customers. As I mentioned, we are continuing to bend the curve in those investments and getting scale and productivity really out of marketing and technology, and we're continuing to optimize our supply chain.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. Best regards.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. You made the mention of strategic brand partnerships a number of times during the script. Historically, you guys have maintained more open to buy than maybe some of your peers' less reliance in hard shop-in-shops but over time you started to add some brand exclusives. I guess, is this a step change from what you've done previously? Or is this just a continuation of that trend? Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hi. This is Erik. I'll take that. Well, a couple of things. We really haven't changed on the hard shops. We have very little of that in our stores. But we do have a trend, a multiyear trend of having more strategic relationships and I would clarify it's not necessarily exclusive brands. We're not looking to have merchandise that's exclusive for the sake of exclusivity.","We're looking to have the most current relevant sought-after brands and we believe in brands that's out there. So we think the appropriate thing given the changing dynamics in our industry is to have more strategic partnerships with brands that are not widely, widely distributed. So that's been very successful from both the sales growth standpoint and a gross margins standpoint and we do plan on growing our strategic brand business at a faster rate than our overall business.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. Just wanted to maybe flesh out a little bit more detail regarding the plan for retail EBIT in 2018 and very specifically to what extent you're able to get an improvement from those initiatives such as Canada and Trunk Club. If you can give some color on that, that'd be helpful.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah. So as I mentioned in my comments, we're changing our reporting metric, so we'll no longer split out. We're just going to have one JWN component to how we're looking at the business going forward. As far as the components of our generational investments, there is a slide in the materials that we show the total of what we're going to get contribution from in the generational investments that include all of those items.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. In terms of the integration of the digital and physical assets, it sounds like an exciting initiative. Just curious what you're hoping to learn from the L.A. test. It seems like a natural evolution of your capabilities you've been building for some years. Just curious how quickly you could roll this out to other key markets. Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Hi, Mark. This is Erik. Yeah, we're excited about it for a couple reasons. One of them being that as you know, we've been investing pretty significantly against adding capabilities, certainly digital capabilities, but also capabilities in our stores to serve customers in the new ways they want to be served. Many of these capabilities are in place, yet they're not linked.","So we see the opportunity and first, we think we can move faster for the whole company by focusing our efforts in Los Angles to learn quickly, but we see the opportunity to link many of these capabilities to really make a difference with customers. So our focus is this year to move fast in Los Angles to connect these capabilities both physical and digital, and learn a lot to where we can start scaling out to the rest of the company in 2019 and 2020.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Thanks and best of luck.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please proceed.","Daniel Stroller - Nomura Instinet LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. This is Dan Stroller on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. Could you talk a bit about the Beauty category? We're curious about performance there, and any initiatives going forward? And also how you view the promotional environment within this category? Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Okay. This is Erik. I'll take that. Beauty continues to be very strong for us, very solid business. A lot of it is like the other parts of our business driven by new or not highly distributed brands and brand launches. So that business continues to be very healthy and solid. The promotional environment you're asking about, Beauty promotional environment specifically?","Daniel Stroller - Nomura Instinet LLC","Yes, specifically. Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Okay. Well, as you know, Beauty is traditionally not a very promotional category for us. It's been a bit more in the last year, but not in a real impactful way for us.","Daniel Stroller - Nomura Instinet LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just bigger picture as you think about your comp guidance for the year of up 0.5 point to 1.5%. I guess, what gives you that confidence in the continued momentum build in this past year? And then within that guide could you just talk about what you're assuming for transactions or traffic? And then just finally just again to the comp. Some of your competitors are talking about a stronger first half. Any nuances in terms of when we're shaping the comp guidance? Thanks.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah. So when we look at the comp guidance, if you look at where we finished the year at a 0.8% in our guidance, it really puts the midpoint around that point. So when we look at our guidance, again it's based on a trend over the last several quarters, and that's how we got comfortable with our top line.","As far as the transactions piece to it, what was coming out of 2017 it's been really pretty consistent, and so we're assuming pretty consistent trends on that as well. And then as far as the top-line comp performance, there is a slide in the appendix of the deck that we gave you guys. We don't normally give comp guidance or even quarterly guidance, but we did try to lay out some of the event shifts with the Anniversary Sale and what some of the comp impacts are going to be first half and second half.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, and again the slide deck was very helpful. The question is on the full-line comp still down here in the fourth quarter, but I believe it's the best in a couple years. So, I'm just wondering how we should think about the sustainability of that momentum in 2018. And then, Anne, just on the EBIT guide for 2018, any color between retail and credit, clearly credit, it looks like credit EBIT dollars in 2017 doubled. Do you think that can continue? Thanks.","James F. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Chuck, this is Jamie. I'll take the first part of that. As we've been talking for the last few quarters and particularly going forward around our full-price performance, we're really focusing on how to better serve customers market-by-market. And so we're less as focused on the full-line store comp as opposed to how we can gain market share in every market that we compete in. And that means continuing to break down the barriers between the digital experience and the store experience.","Erik mentioned some of the things that we're going to be focusing in on L.A. going faster at that. And so our plan is to continue to grow market share by leveraging all these investments that we've made and the capabilities that we've rolled out, mostly by connecting them together and creating a better experience for our customers in every market that we do business in.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah, and for the EBIT and the credit piece we do have in the appendix of the guidance assumptions we refer to the credit revenue growth. We gave some guidance on that. And again, as we go forward we are combining our EBIT number to be one JWN.","Operator","Thank you. Next is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please proceed.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, everyone. It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I have question about the SG&A in the fourth quarter. I think, you said there was 90 basis points of one-time charges. And I was just wondering aside from the $16 million, what the other one-timers were. I didn't know \u2013 I know you mentioned something about incentive comp, but I don't think that's the one-time you're talking about. So just more clarity there, thanks.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah. So part of it is we're anniversary-ing a legal gain, a settlement of gain, in 2016. So that has a negative impact on the year-over-year comparison.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So that was the 90 basis points?","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","That was part of the 90 basis points. Yeah, so there was the one-time \u2013 yeah, and then the comping of the legal gains.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then how much was the increase in incentive comp? I think that that's what you said took you to the low end of the range that you expected back in January.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yeah. So I think if you look at the range, you can get pretty close to where it would have been.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So that was the difference. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Bilun Boyner - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Bilun Boyner on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. So far, Rack store comps it was a really nice improvement here from Q3. Can we talk about maybe some of the drivers there? What did you do differently through the holidays maybe that led to this improvement? And then last year I believe you had mentioned that the team was maybe too optimistic at the beginning of the year with Rack inventory plans compared to how it actually played out, at least the first half of the year. So as we look into fiscal 2018, how are you planning Rack inventories, or maybe buys?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","This is Blake. I'll take that. Yeah. We were pleased that Q4 was improvement and kind of back towards a more historical trend. No question in Q3 we were disappointed, and it underperformed our plans. As we've said the \u2013 or I've talked about the last couple of quarters, there's a number of factors. But one of the biggest we felt, and you alluded to it in the last part of your question, is our management of the inventories \u2013 the balance, the content, the flow. And are we in market in a fluid manner, reacting to the business in a timely way to have trend-right merchandise with great values. And we felt like, particularly in hindsight now, that we \u2013 our plans weren't as grounded as they could be, and as we weren't meeting those plans, we weren't making the necessary adjustments.","And so we literally went three quarters where we were slightly overbought and not in market the way we'd like to be. The team worked hard on that, and we think that was reflective in the Q4 numbers. And we got back to kind of a historical approach to inventories in Q4. We're particularly excited about where we are today and how we start the year in 2018. Both full-price and off-price has very solid inventory management. The aging of it is good. We think we're in a very good position to achieve the goals we've laid out for this year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. On the gross margin front, I guess, can you speak to some of the headwinds that impacted the fourth quarter? And then for this year, what are the drivers behind the modest merchandise margin expansion? And what comp is needed to lever the underlying buying and occupancy this year.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","So in my comments in my script I mentioned that our merch margin was pretty consistent year-over-year for 2017, as well as Q4. And really the big headwinds were in our occupancy expenses with some of the pre-opening costs we've had in Canada with the Rack stores, as well as in New York City. So when we look at it, those were really what was driving the fourth quarter.","As far as the modest improvement in 2018, it's really two different pieces to it. One, as we've talked about, in our journey for fashion authority, as we continue to grow our limited distribution assortment, it has a higher margin rate for us. And so that's helping some of the improvement that we're calling out in 2018. The other piece to it, as Blake just referred to in discussing the Rack performance, we expect to see some improvement in that area as well as we start the year in a better inventory position, as well as having a pretty disciplined look on our buy.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. And if there's more detail in the slides, feel free to refer me there. I haven't had a chance to get through every single one of them. But I'm wondering if you can just help us understand what defines a general generational investment for you. I'm just not familiar with that term and how you distinguish which investments are categorized as generational versus otherwise. Let's just start with that one. Thanks.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Yes. So for us, generational investments, there's really just a couple of very big items that we've been investing along the way and then done some acquisitions. So it's HauteLook, which is now Nordstrom.com HauteLook, it's our Trunk Club acquisition...","Blake W. Nordstrom - Nordstrom, Inc.","Nordstromrack.com.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","I'm sorry. Nordstromrack.com. Thank you. It's our investment in Canada as well as our investment in New York City.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then in terms of the new reporting structure, are we going to be getting a Nordstrom full-line division report separate from the Rack division report? I'm not sure I totally understand what pieces of financial transparency are being removed.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","So we will continue to highlight and we're giving guidance on a JWN perspective. We'll give color commentary on off-price, full-price business.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So no reporting for each of the two divisions separately?","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","We'll do off-price and full-price. We're no longer going to give you channel specific numbers.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then lastly, are you reporting credit revenues separately? I guess, there's new guidelines on credit and so a lot of retailers are pulling it out, the credit income, into a separate revenue line. Will we continue to see that separately?","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","So we will have credit revenue, but the actual EBIT piece to it will be combined as a JWN.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. Thank you for the clarification.","Anne L. Bramman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Sure.","Trina Schurman - Nordstrom, Inc.","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

At the request of Nordstrom, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I will now introduce Rob Campbell, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin, sir.","Robert E. Campbell","Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include about 30 minutes for your questions.","As a reminder, all forward-looking statements on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions discussed due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom, Inc.; and Mike Koppel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's third quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2013. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; Erik Nordstrom, President of Stores; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Direct.","Before we begin, I want to mention that Blake and Mike will be using slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, we're actively engaged in a number of initiatives as we execute our growth strategy, all of which fit under our overarching goals of striving to be the best in service and experience, increasing our relevance with existing and new customers and being the retailer of choice, whether in-store or online.","There are benefits to create synergies across our businesses that promote a seamless customer experience. We'd like to use this time to provide an update.","First, a comment on current trends. Our online business continues to deliver considerable growth, consistent with our expectations and reflective of the investments we're making to elevate the online shopping experience. We're encouraged that the Rack same-store sales, after a slower start to the year, have rebounded and were in line with our plan in the third quarter.","As we've commented in previous quarters, we've experienced softness in our full-line store sales, with third quarter results consistent with recent trends but lower than what we anticipated as we started the year.","We don't believe it's attributable to any one factor. That said, we know customers respond to freshness and fashion, and we're working to provide that, combined with ongoing efforts to enhance the store environment and overall execution.","The momentum in our Women's Apparel business continued, benefiting from increased focus on key brands and improved shopping environment and product innovation.","We're appealing to new customers with our repositioned Savvy department, featuring on-trend fashion at more accessible price points and with the expansion of Topshop into a greater number of stores.","We started the year with Topshop in 14 stores and now, we're in 41, with more to come next year. The performance of these departments is meaningful individually, but also collectively, in terms of the impact they are having on our overall Women's business.","In September, we relocated our full-line store in Glendale, California with opening sales exceeding plan. The interior design concepts, which reflect our customers' desire to make it easier to shop, emphasized selling floor flexibility through the ability to more quickly adjust and evolve departments over time.","This is the approach we've taken with all of our 2013 remodels, including select stores in Southern California, Chicago, Seattle, Connecticut and Florida and will be included in our renovation program going forward.","We're encouraged by the ongoing growth in our e-commerce business. We've had 2 consecutive years of at least 30% sales growth at nordstrom.com. And this year, we're on track to have a similar increase.","Our efforts to personalize the customer experience based on customer preferences and purchase history continue.","In addition, we are close to announcing a site for an East Coast fulfillment center to further enhance our ability to deliver on customers' expectations for fast, reliable delivery.","Turning to the Rack. We opened 11 stores during the quarter, including 1 relocation. At least half represented new markets for us, including 2 that were in new states. This year, we've opened 24 Racks, including 2 relocations, and we plan to open roughly 30 Racks in 2014.","As we expand the number of stores, we're also expanding the services we're offering. We recently added capabilities through our mobile point-of-sale devices in the Rack to locate and send the customers merchandise from any one of our Rack locations.","In addition, we're enabling our Rack stores to accept HauteLook merchandise returns, which has added convenience for our customers while driving incremental traffic to our Racks and further integrating the customer experience across channels.","Our HauteLook business has grown by over 25% year-to-date and now has nearly 15 million members. We recently opened a 900,000 square foot fulfillment center in San Bernardino that is much more automated than its predecessor. It has capacity for nearly 3 million units, which will support significant multi-channel growth.","In addition, today, we're adding on HauteLook, a persistent selection of Nordstrom Rack merchandise to complement HauteLook's existing flash sale offering. We're pleased with the growth and integration taking place in this part of our business.","While we're making improvements to each individual channel in which we operate, we recognize that the customer views us simply as Nordstrom. Increasingly, we're seeing the benefits not only of the growth at each channel but also the synergies between them, including customer acquisition and retention.","We know that our most engaged customers shop us in multiple channels and spend 3x to 4x as much as other customers. Using enablers such as technology, Nordstrom Rewards, inventory access, supply chain, marketing and merchandise returns that we can leverage across the company are critical in making for a seamless customer experience.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. We remain strongly committed to our growth strategy, which focuses on delivering a differentiated customer experience across all channels. We're working to achieve this while also being mindful of the daily execution of our business.","After 3 quarters, we've been encouraged with the momentum we've experienced, particularly in our Direct and Rack businesses. Full-line sales trends during the year have been consistent, though less than planned, but we've been pleased with our execution around inventory and expenses, which has mitigated the top line softness in our full-line stores.","Our third quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.69 were in line with our full year outlook. This reflected our Anniversary event shift, which represented an estimated decrease to earnings per diluted share of $0.06.","Combined second and third quarter same-store sales, which eliminates the impact of the event shift, increased 2.4% and was comparable with the first quarter performance.","As Blake mentioned, our overall sales performance was consistent with the full year outlook that we shared last quarter. We continued to see outsized growth in Direct, reflecting our ongoing efforts to expand merchandise selection and enhance the online experience.","In addition, HauteLook generated a strong sales increase. We believe that the continued integration of HauteLook positions us well to serve more customers in the online off-price channel.","Rack total sales increased 16% in the quarter, reflecting 20 stores opened since the third quarter of last year. Rack same-store sales showed improvement from earlier in the year, tracking in line with our plan.","Full-line sales performance represented a continuation of sales trends experienced in the first half of the year. Top geographic performances were in the Southwest and Southern California regions.","The notable improvement in the Southern California region in part reflected recent strategic investments, particularly in Women's Apparel.","Merchandise category performance also showed consistency in terms of relative trends throughout the year. Top performing categories included Cosmetics, Women's Apparel and Women's Shoes. We've been encouraged with the strategic changes in Women's Apparel, which outperformed the Nordstrom average on a year-to-date basis.","Now let's move onto inventory and expense performance, where our disciplined execution drove results that were in line with our plans.","Inventory growth per square foot of 5.9% exceeded sales growth per square foot of 0.3%, primarily due to the Anniversary shift and investments in pack and hold inventory to fuel Racks growth.","Third quarter gross profit rate decreased 41 basis points relative to last year, primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to the accelerated Rack store expansion.","The strength in regular price selling continued with the percentage of regular price sales in line with last year's historical high for the third quarter.","The growth in our Nordstrom Rewards program continued with more than 3.7 million active members, up 15% compared to last year and year-to-date card penetration of 38%, up from 36% a year ago.","Our credit card portfolio performance remains healthy with delinquency and write-off rates around a 5-year low.","Third quarter SG&A rate increased 65 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to deleverage from the event shift and planned growth investments including technology, fulfillment, the Rack and Canada expansion. This included $6 million of expenses related to Canada and Rack's growth or $16 million on a year-to-date basis, which is on track with our full year estimate of $20 million to $25 million.","On a year-to-date basis, our SG&A rate improved 13 basis points relative to last year. Our 4-Wall business, which represents our full-line and Rack comparable stores, continued to generate year-over-year improvement in SG&A rate performance, demonstrating our ongoing disciplined execution.","Our financial position is sound, with roughly $950 million of cash, total liquidity of nearly $2 billion and operating cash flow of over $700 million.","Adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.1x is well within the range of investment grade. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for a total of $155 million with $824 million remaining under our existing authorizations.","Year-to-date net capital expenditures were approximately $550 million, consistent with our full year expectations of $750 million to $790 million.","At the end of the quarter, return on invested capital increased to 14% from 12.9% a year ago.","As we've previously shared with you, these investments are fueling growth for the entire company. When reviewing the overall performance of our capital investments made over the past several years, they exceeded our expectations and were accretive to our total company return on invested capital.","Our track record of successfully reinvesting in our business adds to our confidence and we -- as we move forward with our growth plans. In doing so, we continue to look for ways to make the store experience more compelling. We are encouraged with the initial results from our recent store investments in Women's Apparel, reflecting our efforts to cost effectively add selling floor flexibility to more strongly emphasize brands and to innovate with product.","Our recent learnings are informing enhancements to our remodel strategy to touch more stores more frequently through a more targeted department focus.","Finally, I'd like to address our updated outlook for the year. Our current outlook of earnings per diluted share is $3.65 to $3.70 compared to our prior outlook of $3.60 to $3.70. We expect the same-store sales increase of approximately 2.5%, which is consistent with our year-to-date trend.","Included in our outlook are the following considerations: the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2012 represented a sales increase of approximately $162 million and earnings per diluted share increase of approximately $0.04, and we anticipate no material impact to fourth quarter sales related to the compression of holiday shopping days.","In closing, we continue to make progress on improving the customer experience and look forward to the growth opportunities ahead.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] So, Lisa, with that, let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dorothy Lackner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the full-line stores. Obviously, Rack has been -- has had a nice rebound here, direct is very strong and you're up against 3 years of some pretty strong numbers. So just wondering, if you look at the merchandise categories across the full-line businesses, is there anything that you're seeing that's kind of impeding the comp there, or is it simply the comparisons are tough?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I don't think we would say that the comparisons really are so much the issue. I think, for us, the most challenging business that we've had that's sizable is the Women's Junior part of the business, and that's going on for, gosh, about a year now. It's been pretty challenging for us. I don't know if that's unique to us in the industry, but it's a sizable part of our business and something that we're -- and we feel like we're working the right things. Otherwise, the business has been relatively stable and consistent this year. And we talked about the divisions that are doing well, Cosmetics and Women's Apparel, Women's shoes. Our Men's business has been solid. So I don't -- there's not any big outliers there that I think are indicative of something that we need to change remarkably. I would say that the things that we think we're working on that are bearing fruit in particular, the success we've had in Women's. There's learnings there that we can continue to apply towards that division and also to other merchandise divisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you speak to the health of your core consumer? How are they feeling right now? And if you can just comment on the trends in the later half of the quarter.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Paul, this is Blake. Our trends, as both Mike and I tried to relay in our comments, have been very consistent throughout this year. And so, we are planning accordingly for the fourth quarter. We're taking those numbers and those results as we move forward. So we aren't planning for any change going forward. And beyond that, I mean, I don't -- we don't comment about economic or customer issues beyond how they vote with their dollars.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just -- is there any color you can provide just in terms of kind of the early '14 outlook, investment dollars expected for your entry into Canada, just how we should think about '14?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Paul, this is Mike. We'll be commenting on that more in detail when we talk in February. We're right now in the process of developing and refining those plans. And we'll be happy to give you a little bit more insight into that when we report fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You've really ramped up the pace of the Rack store openings as you look to double the count by 2016. Can you give us any insights into some of the newer markets or stores you're entering? Are you seeing cannibalization? And are they ramping with the same productivity that you've seen out of some of your legacy stores?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Yes. This is Blake. To-date, we've been very pleased with the accelerated growth and the results have exceeded our expectations. One of your questions was has it had any cannibalization on comps or what it's done on the productivity. Our productivity is maintained and even improved slightly. So at this juncture, we're really pleased with the execution of those stores, and we think it's reflected in the numbers. We were concerned about our ability to find good real estate, the talent needed for those stores, the customers' response and probably most importantly our ability to access inventory. And I guess, across all fronts at this moment, we couldn't be more encouraged by both the reception, the results and the opportunities. So we're forging ahead.","Michael G. Koppel","Ed, I would just add a small comment. We included a slide that indicated the returns we're getting, and the Rack stores continue to deliver very consistent return year-over-year on each vintage of store opening. So again, to Blake's point, we're very happy with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Underlying the gross margin line, what's the trend that you're seeing with the core merchandise margins? How should we think about this going forward? And should we model continued occupancy pressure from Rack, as this continues to expand over the next couple of years?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Matthew, this is Mike. In terms of overall merchandise margins, other than the impact of the mix of Rack growing faster than full-line, merchandise margins have been relatively constant. Most of the change that we're seeing in the gross profit as we report is a result of what I just mentioned earlier, the mix as well as the increased occupancy costs and the acceleration of the Rack. In addition, we have had some pressure from the Nordstrom Rewards program, although that is a little bit lighter than it was last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, I'm wondering if you can talk to us about the inventory levels here coming into the fourth quarter. How are you feeling about your inventory levels? Is there any sort of color on how you think you'll exit the year? And if you can just talk to us about any kind of performance differentials relative to last year that you're seeing in your seasonal categories, that would be great.","Michael G. Koppel","Sure, Kimberly. In terms of inventory levels, I would say our levels in execution have been relatively consistent throughout the year. We're transitioning from the third quarter to the fourth quarter with how we feel inventory to be in very good shape. The growth in the levels is primarily due to some timing relative to anniversary in a way that sales per square foot was calculated and then clearly the investments that we're making in growing the Rack with the pack-and-hold strategy. In terms of the aging of the categories and the segmenting of the inventory, it's all very healthy. So we feel good about it. We've clearly maintained a prudent outlook in terms of our sales projections and how we made commitments to inventory and that's helped us transition through this period. So we expect that coming out of the fourth quarter that unless there is some unusual, unforeseen event that our inventory levels should be in good shape going into 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just hoping for a bit more of an update on the progress in Canada, how the team is progressing, do you have the people that you need? And also, how fast do you think you'll be able to open Racks once you have the full-line stores open?","Michael G. Koppel","Erik, can you comment on that, please?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Sure. Thanks, Lorraine. We're very happy with our progress in Canada. There's a lot of work. It's not the sexiest of work. It's a lot of operational issues to address. And we have our very best people we've assigned to that. Karen McKibbin, the President of Nordstrom Canada. For us, she's one of the great team. So I would say we're very encouraged. It certainly starts with we've got great real estate, and the locations we have really couldn't be better. And now, it's up to us and we've been working with our vendors a lot in the last several months. The vast, vast majority of our vendors have capabilities of distributing in Canada. So that -- there's a handful that we have to work with to get them up there. We really haven't gone to big hiring yet. That's coming right after the first year at Calgary to hire the people that will work in the store, hire the Canadians. We have a solid plan on that. As you know, service is, has to be, needs to be our point of difference. And we don't take that for granted, especially in the foreign land for us. So that's our focus. Not much to report on that yet. As for your second question on the Rack stores, the Rack stores can open fairly quickly, not quite as quick as here in the U.S. but fairly quickly after that. And we're -- we've been doing a lot of work and looking at some real estate. There are some good locations there. But we haven't quite finalized our opening schedule for the Rack yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Black with Jennifer Black & Associates.","Jennifer Black","I noticed that you're running a 10 point Fashion Rewards event at Rack, November 23 and 24. And I wondered if that was in response to the promotional environment possibly getting ahead of Black Friday. And also, can you tell us what kind of response you've had to 5 Rack customers for the Fashion Rewards program? And are you seeing growth in the number of Nordstrom credit card holders at Rack and what percent of your Rack customers still hold credit cards?","Michael G. Koppel","Hello, Jennifer. This is Mike. I'm going to tackle those points. In terms of the Rack customers and the Nordstrom Rewards program, as you know, we opened it up to our Rack customers back in January of 2012 and since then, we've had roughly half of our new accounts that have been -- that have resulted from folks that the accounts have been opened at the Rack. So we continue to see a terrific response to those customers joining the Fashion Rewards customers. We also find that a lot of those customers tend to be a little younger and they tend to also open with our debit card. So we're very happy with that, and we see it as part of our overall event -- our overall effort to grow with our younger customers. As far as the 10 point event, that was a very limited event that was to a select group of customers. So it wasn't any response to any major promotion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Erik and Pete, I have some questions for you guys related just to the overall store environment. I just don't know which one of the two of you is going to [indiscernible] . So you've definitely have done a major undertaking on kind of redesigning the Savvy department in taking that over. I'm hearing from you still that BP or Junior is still underperforming. Is that a next sort of major candidate to be redesigned? And then, similarly to that, the customer service bays, at least in some of the stores we've been in, have been shut down and kind of pushed out back to the store associates. Is there an opportunity to really raise the productivity per foot by repurposing some of that dormant space?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Yes. This is Pete. Gosh, related to BP, I think there's some of the residual effect from the success that we've had with Topshop and Savvy and the customers that we're trying to get after there. I mean, what we're really trying to do is not measure any of these departments so much in isolation but see how it all works together from end to end. And I think part of our theme all along in recent history has been trying to be more compelling to young customers and attract new customers and acquire new customers. And so, it's a big state to operate in. It's competitive. It's dynamic. And, yes, I think it's fair to say that we have got to work hard to address the issues that we have in BP. We're just not going to sit idly by and have that business be challenged. But it's part of how the whole thing works together with the other elements of Women's Apparel. I think we've got a pretty good plan based on some of the recent renovations that we've been able to do in Southern California in particular, that gives us a blueprint for success going forward in the stores. In terms of customer service, I think that's just part of our ongoing evolution, how we can serve customers better. And the most convenient way to serve customers is to have them be able to get the service they need wherever they want in the store rather than to go someplace special to get services provided for them. So it's in that spirit that we've tried to enable all our departments and our salespeople to be able to handle any number of issues that a customer may have. The byproduct of that is we might be able to repurpose some of that space and apply it in a way we have -- particularly in productive stores, where we can sell more. That would be true. But we handle those all kind of one at a time. And we're definitely, gradually and pragmatically evolving that whole process because the last thing you want to do is have any unintended consequence of giving worse service as a result of that. So we're being careful there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Blake, when you take a step back and look at your overall comp trends year-to-date, you're running up about 2.5%. If you look a little bit further back the past 3 years from, say, '10 to '12, you've delivered close to an 8% comp. And I'm just trying to get a sense for when you think about beyond the fourth quarter just over the next couple of years, what's the right comp assumption for Nordstrom when you blend it all together between the Rack, between HauteLook, between a full-line and between e-com?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Charles, that's a good question. And I think the main thing that we want to emphasize and hopefully is coming through is that it's super important that we don't get overbought and that we stay close to the customer and we maintain that flexibility. And so, it was asked earlier about our inventory, and I just give our team really high marks with some of these softer sales to continue to keep the inventories fresh and current and in line, so we can continue to try things and adjust. And so, when we think about our planning process, it's different than our goals. And so, we talked about fourth quarter, you just asked about how should we think about it for 2014. We're going to take the trends and the facts are where we're running right now and put that in from a budget planning point of view. But again, our hope is from a goal point of view that there will be some upside. But there's nothing today that would say to us we should dramatically change our plans. They're tied to performance. And so, our business, though, in total really produces a very strong bottom line at that 8% or mid- to high-single digit comp for the total organization. And so, what we are again continuing to evolve with is ensuring that each element of this business is maximizing their opportunities. But really, where it all comes together is to allow the customers to shop on their terms between all those different channels, and we think that's where the best outcome comes for the shareholder.","Michael G. Koppel","Charles, this is Mike. I would also add one thing. As you know, we've been reiterating that our long-term goals are to grow the top line and that's total sales at a high-single digit. And so, within that, there will be variations on comp as the years go by. But in the long run, that is our overall goal. So that's something to consider.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just back on the topic of cannibalization as you've opened up more Rack stores, I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of the full price for cannibalization if you're measuring that and what you're seeing. And then, just one other follow-up on the HauteLook business. Could you just give us an update on the profitability of that business, where we're looking to end up this year versus last year?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Paul, so this is Blake, and I'll take the Rack part of it. We've had an example or 2 where -- in an isolated situation, where Rack has opened and has had a short-term slight impact on a full-line store. But in aggregate and in total, it's been synergistic and complementary. And so, we view it as a real positive. There is a similar customer, and there is also a different customer and there are some cross-channel shopping. But to-date, it's been a real positive for the company to locate Racks next to our best full-line stores, and we're continuing with that strategy.","Michael G. Koppel","Paul, this is Mike. In terms of the question on HauteLook's profitability, beginning in the third quarter of last year, we started generating operating profit in HauteLook. And we expect for the full year 2013 to generate operating profit. We're really excited with the progress we've made there, not only in our ability to continue to grow the top line through our -- through the integration we have with the rest of our business but also that we've developed a much more efficient model from the delivery and fulfillment standpoint, which has allowed us to become more profitable. So we'll give a little more color on that as we transition out of the year. But we feel good about the progress there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We talked earlier in the year. I think you were surprised a little bit at how Rack sales have decelerated through the year. If we just step back in a bigger picture here, now that you've have seen quite of a gradual re-acceleration coming in, what can you tell us as you guys have done some soul-searching on that, what might have been holding it back? Do you think you figured it out at this point?","Blake W. Nordstrom","Well, this is Blake. It's always lots of things. I don't think there's any one thing that we would point to. And, yes, you're correct, we were, towards the beginning of the year, coming in a little bit below our plan from a comp point of view. The new stores were continuing to exceed their plans. And we're pleased during the third quarter that it's gotten closer in range with our budget and it's improved. But there just are a number of initiatives that, that team has been working on and continues to work on. That's a very fluid and dynamic business. And every day, there's a whole host of challenges and opportunities. And so, it's encouraging to us to see that improve. And again, we've got to execute that through this busy time period in the fourth quarter and going forward. But at this juncture, we're really pleased how the customer is responding to that. But there isn't one that I would call out. We did mention, from an inventory point of view, the pack-and-hold subject and that has been a real plus to the business to be able to help turn the corner by season quicker to be able to open the amount of new stores that we have in a fresh and compelling way and to really provide some sizes in some of the top merchandise in our stores. So that's been a strategic advantage so far.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And if I could just ask one follow-up. Could we talk a little bit about the merchandise plan in the cold weather categories for the next few months? You guys stand out as really having done a great job in the past making brands like UGGs and others in boots really, really big in the winter when weather was even close to normal. So that's been a struggle for everybody for a couple of years. How do you think about setting the inventories for this year and how much you'll be able to chase sales if weather is normal?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I think we give our teams a lot of credit for partnering with vendors because we're all dealing with the same issues. And I think any way that we can collaborate together to make most efficient use of inventory is the way to go. And UGG as an example, it's a big business for us, but we've been doing business together for a while and I think that every year it gets a little bit better in terms of the predictive modeling and how to flow inventory in the most efficient way. So we're doing well there. I think we fully expect that in the seasonal categories that it's going to be good for us. All indications are right now is from coats to boots or what have you that's all going well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","First, just a follow-up on that -- the Rack pack-and-hold. So is there a percentage of the inventory that you'll -- that you're looking to move to in that pack-and-hold category in Rack? And does that mean that's just necessarily the entire inventory turns for the organizational slowdown?","Blake W. Nordstrom","So this is Blake. We have approximately $174 million in that pack-and-hold classification. It is from last year up considerably because as we're newer into this process and ramping up. But that's pretty fluid. And then, for the total, we're very comfortable with the percentage, how it fits in there. And the Rack merchandising team we think is really deploying it well. So at this juncture, it's a positive to the total. But it does have an impact from last year as we move it up. And there's a little bit of an apples and oranges. Hence, why we've been calling it out, but so far so good.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Wanted to just get a little bit more about the online and I know everybody's in the thinking and agreement that online and the stores are synergistic. But are there some categories of goods that will just always be sold in stores like coats? In other words, are you seeing a pattern that certain items are bought more prevalently online and certain items are always more prevalent in the stores?","James F. Nordstrom","Paul, this is Jamie. That's a good question. I think we talked a lot about that in previous years, as our online business was still in its infancy. And I think, at every corner, we've discovered that, no, that customers -- particularly our customers, they love fashion, they love freshness, they love to see something new. And increasingly, as we're seeing customers are using e-commerce and our website to find out what the new trend is and what's hot and [indiscernible] where they end up choosing to actually buy that item whether it's on our website or on their phone or coming into our store, we want to make that as great an experience as possible. So we don't really think about channel conflicts or channel shifts, we think about our customer and how they want to shop and how can we create a great environment for them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. One, the Direct business has done very well, and it appears that you're offering a lot more product, that's to say, more customer choices online than in stores. Could you quantify that, the additional either SKUs or choices that are available online versus stores? And then, I have a quick follow-on.","Blake W. Nordstrom","Yes. I don't have the most recent numbers. But it's in the -- we'll call it a 50% increase roughly this year versus last year in terms of the breadth of offering on our website. And I think what you'll see today is, on our website, just about everything we offer in our stores with very, very few exceptions. And then, in certain categories, we're offering brands and styles that we don't have in our stores, not because we wouldn't want to carry that merchandise but because we just don't have the space. And there's a lot of great brands of footwear or Women's Apparel out there that we can't get to in our stores but can in our website and customers have responded. So we think that there's a lot of runway left for us on expanding that selection, and we'll be focused on that over the next couple of years.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any limits to that [indiscernible] a multiple of what you have in stores?","Blake W. Nordstrom","No. I don't think we can really put a number on it. I think we need to make sure that we do a good job of creating an online experience through navigation and personalization that makes a much larger assortment easy to navigate and fun to shop. And so, we've got to make sure that our investments along those lines keep up commensurate with the growth in our selection. And that's what our plan reflects.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Paul's question earlier, you had mentioned Women's Juniors is one of the more challenged categories in full-line. Does that differ versus the Direct channel versus in-store for that category in particular?","Blake W. Nordstrom","It's been relatively consistent across all channels for us.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, one other follow-up is just on the gross margin line. It just seems like, based on the D&A deleverage and occupancy deleverage, gross margin would have been potentially up. I'm just wondering maybe I'm off there and any kind of color you can provide.","Michael G. Koppel","Well, yes. Stephen, this is Mike. We still would not have seen, I would say, expansion in gross profit percent because we do have the impact of the additional occupancy costs that's flowing through there. So I would say it's safe to say that, at best, that would have been even.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you -- as you think about this upcoming holiday season with the 6 fewer days, how do you see this shorter holiday season differ than others in the past that have been shorter? And are there any calendar shifts and event timing this year as compared to last year?","Peter E. Nordstrom","I guess, I'll take it. This is Pete. I don't think we really think that the calendar is going to pose any significant changes for us, and we don't have any different plans in terms of the rhythm of our business and what we're doing. All of the things that we've talked about, there's a bunch of little things that we're trying to improve on to add up to a better experience. And I think the fact that our inventories have been in really good shape all year long is probably the best indicator of optimism for us coming into the holiday season because we have a lot of newness. We're not bogged down with a bunch of clearance, which for us usually isn't the most important inventory. The most important inventory for us is new [ph] and so, those plans are all going forward. And I think that it should be very similar to last year just in terms of the rhythm of it all.","Michael G. Koppel","Dana, just -- I would add just one more thing. This is Mike. We've looked at this over the years and years where we've had more days and years where we've had less days. And we tend to see that the overall shopping bag is relatively the same. So we plan accordingly, and we expect a good holiday season.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Could you talk about the premium denim business? What is the trend like? And have you seen any actions in some of these newer silhouettes like the Baby Boot and Skinny Flare?","Peter E. Nordstrom","The premium denim business has held up well. We've had good success both in Men's and Women's. And I think, in terms of specific styles that you're talking about, I don't really have any color to add to that.","Operator","And our final question comes from Rob Wilson with Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Mike, can you go back to that HauteLook profitability question? Can you confirm that it's been profitable thus far for the first 3 quarters of the year?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes, from an operating profit standpoint, it has.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And one last question. On Topshop merchandise, does that merchandise have a higher or lower merchandise margin than the remainder of the store?","Peter E. Nordstrom","I'm really not going to get into that in detail because, frankly, the relationship and the collaboration we have with Topshop is somewhat unique. We do have a wholesale relationship with them, but it's -- I would just say it's different maybe than the other relationships we have. I would say probably one of the things that's important to contemplate when talking about Topshop is just not what the pure margin is, but the degree to which that margin is new or accretive and also the degree to which it's bringing in new and different customers, which we know to be true. So that's -- when you kind of view the totality, it's definitely been a positive -- very positive thing for us.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call, along with our slide presentation, will be available for 1 year on the Investor Relations section of nordstrom.com under Webcasts. In addition, we provided an overview of our performance and growth strategy at the end of our slide presentation. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.

We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today\u2019s earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention that we\u2019ll be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide showing our safe harbor language.","As a reminder on October 16th, the Company announced that members of the Nordstrom Family have suspended active exploration for the balance of the year of the possibility of proposing a transaction to take the Company private. The Company does not plan to comment further on the process including on today\u2019s call.","Participating on today\u2019s call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President; and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the Company\u2019s third quarter performance and the outlook for fiscal year 2017. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake Nordstrom","Good afternoon, and welcome to our call.","In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I\u2019ll share some key initiatives that we\u2019re focusing on for the remainder of the year.","For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67. We estimate these earnings were reduced by roughly $0.04 from hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey which affected our stores in Puerto Rico, South East Florida and Huston. The damage in Puerto Rico was particularly extensive requiring us to close the store as we continue our repair efforts. We\u2019re grateful to our teams in each of these communities who have extended themselves to help our employees and customers.","We reported total sales growth of 2% and a comp decrease of 0.9%. Lost sales from the hurricanes accounted for approximately $20 million or 60 basis points. When adjusting for this impact, our overall sales performance was generally in line with our expectations. This reflected consistent trends in our full-price business while in off-price, we experienced some deterioration relative to recent trends.","In our Nordstrom brand, total sales decreased 1.2% and comps decreased 1.9%. Sales in our full-line stores remained consistent with current trends. As we expected, Nordstrom.com sales reflected a higher volume of returns associated with Anniversary sales last quarter. When we combine July and August to adjust for this timing impact, Nordstrom.com grew at a mid-teens rate.","In our Nordstrom Rack brand, total sales increased 5.5% and comps increased 0.8%, which reflected a step down from recent trends. In hindsight, our sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive. As a result, we found ourselves over-inventoried without the fluidity necessary to chase the business. This impacted our ability to provide newness, which led to softer results in the third quarter. We have made significant adjustments to our receipt plans to bring our inventories in line, and believe we\u2019re well- positioned for the fourth quarter in this regard. We recognize the opportunity to improve our top-line results, and are committed to providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise, and the best value possible. Our Nordstrom Rack business remains a highly productive model and is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year.","Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is as important as ever. We\u2019re continually testing and learning from new concepts to deliver experiences that improve speed, convenience, and personalization for Nordstrom customers. This is core to our strategy of providing a differentiated selection of the best products, coupled with a high level of service and experience.","Our most recent example is Nordstrom Local, a test retail concept that\u2019s focused on services. Centrally located in West Hollywood, Nordstrom Local gives customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders, and more. In the first four weeks since opening, we\u2019ve had thousands of customer interactions and are applying the learnings to innovate further. Ultimately, our goal is to drive increased customer engagement and market share.","Another way we\u2019re engaging with customers on their terms is our Reserve Online and Try In-Store service, which we recently expanded to more than 50 stores across the country. Our customers appreciate its speed and convenience. It frees up their time, and if they choose to do additional shopping in our store, this results in a material lift in their spend. We\u2019re also connecting the digital and in-store experience with our Style Boards. This digital selling tool leverages the expertise of our salespeople and enables customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones.","Providing newness is an important aspect of our approach with the customer, and we\u2019re encouraged by our recent collaborations with emerging brands.","Our Pop-In Shops give customers access to highly sought-after brands like Warby Parker and Goop. Our recent partnership with Everlane has been our most successful Pop-In concept to date. Our partnerships with fashion influencers are another way we\u2019re creating inspiration and discovery for customers. We collaborated with the popular fashion blog, Something Navy, to launch an exclusive capsule collection with our in-house Treasure & Bond brand. It was our largest brand launch ever, generating $2 million in demand for the first day. We made additional progress in growing limited distribution products and our private label brands continue to outperform the Company average.","We view our stores as a competitive asset and have invested in the markets in which we serve customers. We\u2019ve strengthened our presence in Southern California with the relocation of two full-line stores to Century City and University Towne Center. Both openings well exceeded our plans. Also this fall, we had 11 new Rack openings and one relocation in markets that include Los Angeles, Manhattan, and Seattle.","In Canada, we opened the sixth and final of our announced full-line stores with our new store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. We look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack to our Canadian customers starting next spring in Calgary and Toronto.","As we head into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re focused on making Nordstrom a convenient place for customers to do their holiday shopping. We have a number of initiatives in place.","We\u2019ve invested in key categories and brands that resonate most with our customers. This includes expanding our online selection and fulfillment capacity to support the peak volumes that we expect during the holidays.","To make shopping faster and easier, we offer in our full-line stores Buy Online Pick up In-store with an option for curbside services. Also, in several markets, we have available Reserve Online and Try In-Store and same-day delivery services. Next month, we\u2019ll offer 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets, including Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, and San Diego.","During this holiday period, we believe the strength of our digital capabilities along with our local market assets, our people, product, and place represent a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our third quarter performance and outlook for the year.","Anne Bramman","Thanks, Blake and good afternoon everyone.","Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in-line with our expectations.","Looking at the drivers of our results, our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points due to planned occupancy costs associated with new Rack stores in the U.S. and upcoming stores in Canada.","Merchandise margins continue to be relatively stable, reflecting our ongoing progress in supporting a healthy regular-price selling business. For five straight quarters, sales growth outpaced inventory growth, and we exited the third quarter in a relatively clean inventory position. For the balance of the year, our inventory plans are aligned with current sales trends.","Moving to SG&A, our rate was up approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to technology and supply chain expenses. As we\u2019ve commented over the past year, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around our technology, supply chain, and marketing capabilities. This required fundamental changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and support long-term profitable growth. Last year, we made a significant step change to the expense growth in these areas by cutting the recent historical run rate of 20% by half. This year, we are on track to hold this expense rate constant to last year\u2019s growth rate.","In supply chain, we continue to see the mix impact associated with the accelerated growth of online, which is approaching 25% of our sales. We\u2019ve made operational improvements to reduce split shipments and canceled orders. This has resulted in a better customer experience while reducing our average cost per unit. Going forward, we see further opportunities to gain efficiencies.","Technology is another critical enabler in delivering customer experiences. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to modernize our platforms and investments are shifting to cloud-based solutions. This is creating more of an immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. To get a more holistic perspective on our technology investments, we continue to be on track with our plan for total cash spend of roughly $540 million or 3.5% of sales.","Turning to Credit, EBIT increased $16 million over last year, driven by credit card revenue growth of 25%. We also recently sold our bank charter, eliminating associated regulatory requirements and minimal costs.","We\u2019ve been encouraged by the continued momentum in our Nordstrom Rewards program. With nearly 10 million active loyalty customers, our loyalty program represents more than half of our sales year-to-date. This growth has been fueled by the expansion of our program in spring 2016, which enables all of our customers to earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay.","Turning to our financial position, we continue to have a healthy balance sheet and have generated around $600 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Our debt leverage remained consistent with our expectations, at 2.5 times on adjusted debt to EBITDAR basis. We reported double-digit return on invested capital of 10.7%. These metrics reflect our overall favorable positioning in the market.","As Blake mentioned, our combined physical and digital presence is a key differentiator in serving customers and gaining market share. Our omni-channel business model also provides for favorable economics related to driving customer spend, reducing the cost of serving customers, and elevating the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We believe we have meaningful opportunities ahead to further leverage our investments and improve our long-term profitability.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional color on our updated 2017 outlook.","We narrowed our EPS range of $2.85 to $2.95, compared with our prior outlook of $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our third quarter results and the estimated full-year hurricane impact of roughly $0.06. In addition, we adjusted our full-year tax rate to be in-line with the year-to-date rate.","From a top-line perspective, we\u2019ve held our full-year outlook for total sales growth of approximately 4% with roughly flat comps. This incorporates our underlying trends while taking into consideration expectations for continued uncertainty in retail. It also includes the 53rd week impact, which is estimated to add $200 million in sales or 2 to $0.03 in EPS.","Retail gross profit assumes higher occupancy expenses and the mix impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins reflect a solid inventory position heading into the fourth quarter.","Our SG&A assumptions remain consistent, reflecting higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives. As a result, the deleverage in our SG&A rate for the full-year is expected to be relatively similar to what we\u2019ve experienced year-to-date. This is normalized for one-time items, such as a $22 million legal settlement gain in the fourth quarter of last year.","Based on better than expected performance, Credit EBIT is estimated at $165 million, compared with our prior outlook of $145 million.","In closing, we\u2019re well-positioned to execute on our holiday plans and remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we\u2019d like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. And as a reminder, we\u2019ll not be commenting on the October 16th announcement. We\u2019ll now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Max Rakhlenko","Hi, this is Max on for Oliver. We were wondering if you could update us your thoughts and what\u2019s going on with Beauty, and do you see opportunities in that segment? And then, can you update us on handbags as well?","Pete Nordstrom","Yes. This is Pete. As you heard us mention in previous calls, our Beauty business has been consistently good for quite some time. The more that we can elevate and differentiate our product offer, particularly the more kind of prestige type brand, that\u2019s been good for us. There has been a good trend around wellness and natural wellness. [Ph] Our team has been on that -- been all over that stuff. So, it\u2019s a solid performer for us. Beauty is doing fine. I don\u2019t really have anything to report otherwise there. In terms of -- sorry, the other question is handbags?","Max Rakhlenko","Yes.","Pete Nordstrom","In particular, our handbag business has improved and the biggest driver there is the designer handbag business which has been very good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Ed Yruma","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I know you mentioned that Rack has kind of landed a little softer than you would have thought, at least earlier this year. As you step back and think about it, is it due to cannibalization from other Rack stores, is it -- is the off-pricing environment changing, or is it kind of self-inflected kind of quality of inventory issues? Thanks.","Blake Nordstrom","Hi, Ed, this is Blake. I suppose it\u2019s very appropriate to look it like -- in that manner holistically. Internally, we look at the opportunities we have to improve the execution, and that\u2019s in my comments I talked about the inventory opportunities we have. It\u2019s just in any retail business, it\u2019s critical obviously to have the best merchandise and good values. It\u2019s particularly true in an off-price. And having plans that were now in hindsight too aggressive caused our teams to have to pull back a little bit. And so, we weren\u2019t in the market as aggressively as we would like to have been to ensure that we have the right freshness and flow and again corresponding values. We think that culminated a little bit in that downward trend that we saw in the third quarter. We are very pleased as we start the fourth quarter that we are in line. We think we are well-positioned to serve the customer through this holiday time period. But to answer your question, we think it\u2019s those execution opportunities reside primarily with us and we are anxious to try to turn that around here in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. In your slide decks, last year, you often would kind of update us on kind of the growth investments as well as the drag to the EBIT from some of those items like the Canada rollout, Trunk Club, Manhattan preopening. Just if you can just touch on that in terms of what you are seeing from a top-line and EBIT standpoint on a number of those items?","Anne Bramman","Thanks for the question. This is Anne. So, as you mentioned, we do have a lot of those in generational investments that have come through the pipeline in last couple of years. I believe at the beginning of year, we gave guidance that some of the drag from Manhattan was going to be about $30 million for preopening costs. As you can imagine, if you philosophically step back, as some of these come on line, you can assume that we are going to see more leverage coming through to our EBIT number. We will be able to give you more guidance and context around when we give our 2018 guidance in the next call.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then, just then a quick follow-up on -- you showcase the deleverage from technology and supply chain. Just how should we think about that on a go forward basis, especially given the sustained growth in e-commerce? What are the opportunities to provide some offsets, savings and what kind of sales growth will it take to actually once again be able to leverage that line item?","Anne Bramman","Yes. So, I think if you step back and look at the business model, we continue to evaluate how do we serve the customer in a way that they want to be served and investing in that as well as how do we maximize our investments in different -- various markets. So, we really are winning more towards markets where we have more strength. So, as we step back and think about it, we\u2019re trying to balance that we\u2019re driving more productivity and driving efficiencies. We did a great last year of bending the curve in those three key areas between supply chain, technology and marketing. And we\u2019re continuing to see that. We\u2019ve got opportunities and I called it out in my comments, particularly in supply chain to drive more efficiencies.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good afternoon. On the credit revenues up 25%, can you just talk a little bit about were there just a reduction in the standards on credit and is the assumptions on bad debt or just how to think about the profitability in the remainder of this year and into next year? Thanks.","Blake Nordstrom","Bob, this is Blake. I think it\u2019s important to note that we did not change our standards on how we view Credit with our customers. Our team is really executing well, both within the Credit division and obviously in those areas that touch the customers, we execute and service the customer. We\u2019re now two years into a partnership with TD, and that partnership is exceeding our expectations, and I think that\u2019s reflected in our those results as well. So, overall, it\u2019s not a change in the standards. It\u2019s the customer and our folks really getting behind this program, the loyalty program and what it has to offer in terms of value for our customer and it\u2019s a meaningful part of our results.","Operator","Next is Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the guidance. If I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly, you brought the midpoint of the retail EBIT down by about $45 million. I think, $17 million of that was related to the hurricanes, sales guidance roughly unchanged. So, I guess, if you exclude the hurricanes, maybe just talk about what changed regarding your views for the remainder of the year, just balance between gross margin and SG&A spending from here? Thanks.","Anne Bramman","So, when we set up the guidance, the way we looked at it is we did narrow the range, and we\u2019re still tracking in line with our full year expectations. We updated that we incorporate our Q3 results as well as impacts from the hurricane, and then the continuation of our underlying trends and then also took into account some of the ongoing uncertainty in the retail environment. We recognize there is still a lot of volume we have deal in the fourth quarter. And so, we\u2019re just focusing right now on executing our holiday plans.","Mark Altschwager","Got it. And maybe just quick follow-up there on the gross margin. Are you able to quantify the headwinds from off-price mix and the occupancy deleverage for the fourth quarter?","Anne Bramman","We don\u2019t provide detailed guidance at that level. What I can tell you is that we\u2019ve had pretty consistent regular price selling in our full-price business. And entering into the fourth quarter for both off-price and full-price, we\u2019re in a very good inventory position. So, we do believe our margins are going to be relatively stable.","Operator","Next is Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Adrienne Yih","Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to talk about or inquire about for the mall traffic environment in the A malls and also about rent concessions that you might be seeing that might impact 2018. And then, secondarily, others have talked about for the cadence especially regarding sort of cold weather apparel sales in late October and early November, sort of really picking up. If you can comment, whether you\u2019ve seen that as well?","Jamie Nordstrom","Sure. Adrienne, this is Jamie. I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then give the second part of that to Anne and Pete to talk about weather. In terms of traffic, we typically look at transactions as a proxy for traffic. And for at least the last several quarters, transactions have been very consistently correlated with our sales trends. So, we don\u2019t really see much change in traffic patterns of late. And to your question, I think, you would expect that traffic is better in the better malls, the more productive malls. And so, nothing really to point there. In terms of rental concessions, we do very, very little of that, and it\u2019s unique to some portions for our designer business and a couple of other\u2026","Blake Nordstrom","Jamie, I think the question was more if malls maybe had some opportunities, were there some opportunities partnering with some mall owners for some changes in our rents\u2026 [Multiple Speakers]","Adrienne Yih","But that was interesting too\u2026","Jamie Nordstrom","Well, I think what I\u2019d say is that we are -- we have very good relationships with our big malls partners and keeping close contact with them around opportunities to improve those centers. And we have done a number of things, not really around rent structures but in how we can make those centers by partnering with those guys, better. And we\u2019ve done a number of those things. Blake mentioned that this past quarter we opened a new store in Century City as well as a relocation within the same mall, University Towne Center, those are both Westfield properties. Westfield has made big investments in those properties and they\u2019re better and we\u2019re really excited about it. And so far, results there really are good. So, we continue to look for more opportunities along those lines.","Blake Nordstrom","I don\u2019t know if Pete want to take that merchandise?","Pete Nordstrom","Yes. I mean, I am probably just going to state the obvious. But, obviously, the weather has an impact on. And I think that you saw for us in the third quarter, it was unseasonably warm for big parts of the country till late and that had a negative impact on our results, as it got a little cooler at the very end, it improved some. We\u2019ll see how that all works out for the fourth quarter. But, we look at that stuff rally closely. We have a lot of data to mine over the history of how this has all worked out, and trying to ensure that we\u2019re allocating and flowing merchandise and the appropriate timing of a big part of the execution of this business. So, weather is out of our control. But, we\u2019re prepared for it and we do benefit from a change in seasons and when that cold weather comes along for sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next is with Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Siegel","What\u2019s your proprietary brand penetration at this point, and any thoughts to how large private brands could become? And then, just sorry for the dumb question, could you all parse out the difference in the margin flow through between $26 million of hurricane impact at $0.06 versus the $200 million of 53-week sales\u2026","Pete Nordstrom","I don\u2019t know if we give out the specifics around our own label penetration. I think we do -- I can tell you that it\u2019s growing some and that\u2019s a purposeful thing for us. We\u2019ve had really good success with our own label brands. Blake mentioned that they do perform a little bit better in terms of the gross margin. And I think increasingly, we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to be really good at developing and sourcing our own products as well as partnering with brands that are willing to have a bit of a limited approach to distribution. I think that that\u2019s worked really well for us. When you look at our brands that fall into that bucket, whether it\u2019s our own label brands or the ones that are relatively limited, they are outperforming the other brands. So, we definitely think we are on a good path there. I will tell you that we have a lot of common issues with our major suppliers, and when you can put two heads together to work on that as a partner, it creates good outcomes.","Anne Bramman","And then, on your question on the hurricane impact and the 53rd week. So, for hurricane, we have additional color in our release that went out today. But just in general, Q3 had top-line impact of $20 million and Q4 has estimated impact of $6 million, and then it\u2019s $0.04 impact for third quarter and another $0.02 for fourth quarter. For the 53rd week, we think it\u2019s roughly around $200 million of sales and $0.02 to $0.03 improvement to fourth quarter.","Operator","Next is Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","I just had a question on the spread between your Rack brick and mortar comp versus the dotcom. It\u2019s been wider than we have seen in the past. Could you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving the dichotomy there, if it\u2019s category or assortment or promotional cadence? And then, I do have a follow-up on your reward customer.","Blake Nordstrom","It\u2019s Blake. I think we\u2019ve talked about this over time longer, from a full-price point of view. But, we are newer in terms of our digital business ramping up and an off-price point of view. But, we look at it as a total off-price business. And so, separating bricks and mortar, stores and digital, those numbers are getting more and more blurred. And so, we just want to make sure that we are offering the experience in a manner where the customer wants to shop. And the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook business last year did $700 million. I mentioned a while back that it\u2019s the fastest growing business we have in the history of our Company going to a $1 billion. So, it\u2019s a meaningful part of the business. Overall, our total off-price business is $5 billion. And so, where that ends up going, that\u2019s up to the customer. And so, we look at combined and at this point, it\u2019s a healthy business and we see lots of opportunities and we are encouraged by it.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. And just on the reward customer, I think your active count is at 9.9 million, it\u2019s still growing, but this is the lowest incremental customer add we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, and I think the percent of spend by these customers decelerated from Q2. Can you just talk about what -- kind of longer term, how you kind of expect this to ramp, going forward?","Erik Nordstrom","This is Erik. We are very encouraged with our loyalty program, adding a tender neutral option to it is a -- greatly enhance the participation there. We see a long runway ahead of us, really connecting our experience is things like our mobile experience with our loyalty program in particular as much price -- which still feels very early innings for us to continue to enhance that program; and then, to leverage one of the big benefits of program which is the data we have from that to better serve our customers.","Operator","Next is Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon. As you think about this upcoming holiday season, any differences this year and last year, whether it\u2019s marketing programs or initiatives that we should be watching? And then, some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve done like Tesla in the store in California, I saw good traffic there. Any updates on some of those initiatives that you\u2019ve tested and played with? Thank you.","Jamie Nordstrom","Dana, this is Jamie, I\u2019ll take that. I\u2019ll take the second part first. I think what our partnership with Tesla represents is really about us trying to bring in experiences and product into our stores that create a sense of discovery for our customers. We want to be a place where customers go to find something new. And the more that we can go out and find really interesting products and experiences and bring them to the store, we make those stores better. So, we\u2019re always looking for those things and we think that our customers expect.","In terms of services for holiday, a lot of the new tweaks that we\u2019ll be rolling out are around making shopping in our stores more convenient. We just recently announced that in some of our biggest markets, we\u2019ll be offering 24-hour curbside pickup for our customers who are especially time-starved and needed to do their shopping in odd hours of the day. And that\u2019s an example of how we\u2019re looking at all of our capabilities that we\u2019ve invested in over the last few years and how we can leverage them to improve our service and make the experience better.","Operator","Next is Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.","Charles Grom","Hi, thanks. Anne, if I could just circle back on the retail EBIT question, somebody asked earlier. If I think the delta between your old and new, it looks like about $45 million in 2017 is for the hurricanes, so that leaves the balance of 28. And I guess, I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding for what\u2019s changed relative to the guidance you\u2019ve provided in August?","Anne Bramman","So, again, we\u2019re in range of what we gave guidance on in August. We did take down the high end of the range. But relatively speaking, we are in line. And so, what we did was we did bake in the hurricane, we did bake in our Q3 performance. And then, we also took into consideration our current trends when we gave that guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping to ask a bigger picture question. As you guys think out over the next three years or so, what strategic initiatives you are most excited about in terms of anything, whether it be transformational or just how you can sort of get the customer better and drive market share? So, maybe just kind of prioritizing what things you\u2019re excited about as you look over next few years.","Erik Nordstrom","Yes. This is Erik. What tops the list for us is really looking our business by markets. And we\u2019ve been talking about that this year. It may sound subtle but it\u2019s a significant change in doing our business as opposed to looking at our stores, four wall P&Ls, or e-commerce business across the whole country, really looking at customers in a given market, what assets do we have that we can leverage to serve them better. And it goes to things like something that we had placed for a while like Buy Online, Pick Up in Store and store reserve, which you heard Jamie say, is ramping up, Style Boards, curbside service. But in particular, if you think about our market, our assets in addition to the digital assets we have which are in all markets, our physical assets of having the stores, the people in the stores and the inventory. We\u2019ve a lot in inventory that\u2019s deployed very close to where majority of our business is done. And there\u2019s supply chain initiatives that are part of that, there\u2019s marketing initiatives that are part of that that we\u2019re very excited about that will allow us to do things for customers that really we don\u2019t see anyone else who can do some of these things. And Nordstrom Local is part of that that bigger effort. So, I would put that at the top list for us.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Are you able to expand on the things you can do for customers that others can\u2019t?","Erik Nordstrom","Well, take Nordstrom Local as an example. So, that\u2019s a store that\u2019s focused on services. And its\u2019 described as the store without inventory. The stockroom for that store is all the stores we have in the Los Angeles area, for things where a customer has a couple-of-hour window to get their products, so things like a stylist appointment, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, reserving online and trying on the store. We have tremendous selection that we can offer the customer there and offer it in a more convenient way. We know mall traffic is down, and some customers are looking for different ways, but still touching and feeling the product. And having Local is something that we\u2019re uniquely positioned to do.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","And as you think about over the next few years, are your margins, are your retail operating profit margins about where you might expect them to be? I know you\u2019re not giving guidance for next year but just sort of a longer term view on where margins should be?","Anne Bramman","So, as we continue to look out -- we\u2019re not giving guidance for 2018, I would just say that the way we look at the business and we\u2019ve had consistent selling of regular price, especially in our full-price business, we\u2019ve been relatively stable in the last several quarters. And so, we continue to look at having limited distribution in our product, and we continue to really drive clean execution in our inventory. And so, I would continue to expect that we\u2019ll be focusing on staying stable.","Operator","Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed.","Paul Lejuez","Just going back to Rack for a second, can you maybe talk about at the store level what you\u2019re seeing from a traffic versus ticket perspective? Also related to the availability of goods, just trying to understand what went wrong during the quarter. Anything that there wasn\u2019t kind of the right stuff out there available or is it that the right stuff was there and you just weren\u2019t buying the right stuff and just want a little bit of a clarification on that point?","Blake Nordstrom","It really gets down to do you have the best stuff and do you have the best price. And the fact that we saw a downturn a little bit, indicates obviously the customer wasn\u2019t as enamored with some of our choices and our execution. We are not saying that there was a lack of merchandise opportunities out there. What we\u2019re saying is that we got overcommitted to the sales plans, or to the sales results that we had that it didn\u2019t enable us to be as fluid in the market as we would like to be to chase the business a little bit. So, it\u2019s a very fragile balance of having the right flow, having the right balance, a couple of great values. And so, we really view that as our opportunity in the marketplace, some of our competitors are showing consistent results and the vendor partnership work with merchandise, but we just couldn\u2019t get aggressive with some of those opportunities because we had fully committed earlier in the year. And so we made some pretty aggressive changes with that planning to place in a position today where we are in line and we think we have a good plan for the fourth quarter. And I think it will be very important, we come back next quarter, how are those results and where the various initiatives we had to improve execution, did it resonate with the customer.","Paul Lejuez","How about the traffic versus ticket at the store level?","Blake Nordstrom","I am sorry, I forgot that. So, our average unit retail has been very consistent over time. We did see units come down slightly and that\u2019s reflected in the sales numbers.","Operator","Next is Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good afternoon. One shorter term question, first. Can you maybe give us some more details regarding the slowdown in the e-com at the full-price business? And do you expect it to accelerate into the fourth quarter? And when you look at benchmarking, I guess your shipping options versus some of your competitors, do you think you are on par with them or need to make more investments? And then, maybe the bigger picture question is I guess given the omni-channel investments you\u2019ve made and the blurring of all the lines you are talking about, are there new profitability or ROI metrics you are looking at inside the Company compared to how we look at retail metrics outside?","Blake Nordstrom","Let me start with trends at Nordstrom.com. Our trends are actually consistent and have been in the mid double digits all year and we are very encouraged with our trends there. Month-to-month, the timing between shipped sales and returns that come from that can drive the timing of those sales. So, as you know, we had a very, very successful Anniversary sale online. And the returns we get from those sales show up the next month and the month after that. So, we removing those timing issues, our trends at Nordstrom.con are very consistent and we are encouraged about that.","Shipping options, that is a place that we think we can absolutely win with the customer. Again, it\u2019s leveraging our assets. We have a lot of different ways for the customer to engage with us and a lot of different ways of connecting the merchandise the customer wants with how they want to receive it. So, be it in a store, be at their home, be at the discovery portion being digital or in a physical environment. So, you will continue to see us offer more options for the customers. Because we think that\u2019s part -- it\u2019s not just getting merchandise to the customer faster, it\u2019s giving the customer control of how they want it while also offering as much selection as possible for the timeframe that they want to get the merchandise.","Then, about metrics, do you want to take that Anne?","Anne Bramman","Sure. So, as we\u2019ve been talking about last couple of calls, I think, as we talked about the omni-channnel continues to evolve, and I would look for us to be more -- to share in the next several quarters as far as how we are continuing to look at the business and evolve.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So, SG&A dollars per square foot basically up mid single digits this year. If same store sales after this year remained negative low single digits, I guess help us to think about further efficiencies or just any flexibility to right size SG&A next year, I guess particularly with higher expenses related to the Manhattan opening?","Anne Bramman","Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you have to step back, and looking at things on a same store sales basis in the bricks and mortar, given the fact that we just talked about omni-channel and that we\u2019re -- how the customer shops is getting very blurred and very blended. So, as we look at our SG&A and we look at top-line, I don\u2019t know if it is fair metric to try to link the two together because it is becoming so blurred as to how the customer is shopping us. So, I think going forward, as I talked about in my comments, we\u2019re not giving guidance for 2018. Having said that, when you look at our different markets, we are balancing our investments to how the customer wants to be served. But also looking for continued opportunities and productivity and the driving scale in the investments that we have made and we\u2019ll continue to make.","Trina Schurman","Great. We\u2019ll now take one more question.","Operator","Our final question is from the line Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Blake, I wanted to just follow up on the Rack and I had a quick follow-up question for Ann. Is the six on Rack just simply have -- starting the year with a more conservative sales plan, so that you get the inventory in line or do you think a higher sales plan is okay, but rather wait until you\u2019re in season to buy more of the inventory? I just wasn\u2019t sure what the right strategic fit is there?","Blake Nordstrom","Okay, Kimberley. Yes. We started the year with the inventory and sales plan that was a couple of hundred basis points higher than actual. And we should be striving for the opposite of that. We should always maintain a couple of 100 basis points to allow us to have the flexibility to be able to respond to the business in a more timely manner. And so, I think that was probably the biggest driver of opportunity but there is a lots of things that we think there are opportunities in our execution. From afar, it\u2019s relatively simple business. To execute though at this level of $5 billion and as productive as it is, there is a lot of nuances to it. And so our team has been working hard this last year, none of us our satisfied with these results. But, there is a sense of optimism, encouragement about the things they\u2019ve been working on and how that positions us better to be able to respond going forward to the customer. And so, we believe we can get back on the fourth quarter hopefully to the first half trend; that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. But, we need to show improvement and the last quarter certainly was a reflection of the customers indicating that we had some opportunities.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. That was super clear. Thank you so much. And then, Anne, just a follow-up on the margins. Could you talk a little bit about what type of IT and supply chain spending is driving what I think was about 8% growth in SG&A? And is there are there any strategies in place to perhaps bring the SG&A dollar growth rate down, in future years? Any thoughts would be helpful.","Anne Bramman","So, as I mentioned, we aren\u2019t going to give specific guidance for 2018. But having said that, let me just give you a couple of examples of what we\u2019ve been focusing on from investment perspective. So, we talked about migrating more to the cloud as we\u2019ve been progressing. So, it\u2019s really swapping -- it\u2019s same cash dollars, it\u2019s just weather it\u2019s expense or capital. And what the cloud-based solutions allow us to do is it\u2019s easier to scale and it drives better performance overall, both internally and as well for the customer experience. We\u2019ve also been investing quite heavily in reducing customer friction, simplifying our checkout, looking at ways to improve our payment options. So, all those things take investments. On the supply chain side, we\u2019ve really been focusing on reducing the amount of cancellations, which allows for more top line growth and better customer experience and then improving our split shipments which also improves our cost and it is a better customer experience. So, those are the types of things that we\u2019re looking at. So, there is an investment but there\u2019s also a flow through the you see post-implementation. So, as we continue to go through, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019ve got general operational investments coming on line with Manhattan. So, you would expect to start seeing some leverage on that because we\u2019re investing ahead of the curve. And we\u2019re continuing to make investments to drive a better customer experience but also drive productivity and scale in the business.","Trina Schurman","Thank you for joining today\u2019s call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman","Good afternoon, and thank you, for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to the Investor Relations section of nordstrom.com. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Erik Nordstrom, Co-President and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's third quarter performance and outlook for 2019. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, Co-President.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Erik.","Erik Nordstrom","Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with our results. Our market strategy is transforming our business model and how we're serving customer. We have a unique mix of assets, Full Price, Off Price, stores and online, and we are further linking our business to serve customers in new and differentiated ways. The success of our strategy in Los Angeles adds to our confidence as we expand to our top 10 markets. We recently achieved an important milestone with the opening of the New York City flagship store, significantly increasing our presence in the world's top retail market.","Turning to our third quarter results. Our earnings exceeded expectations, demonstrating substantial progress in the delivery of our strategy and strength of our operating discipline. Through our customer focus, we drove broad base improvement in top line trend of more than 200 basis points relative to the first half of the year. In particular, the Off Price business delivered positive sales growth and increased profitability through strong inventory and expense execution. We're encouraged by the momentum in our Full Price and Off Price businesses as we execute our holiday strategy to establish Nordstrom as a gifting destination for our customers.","Through our focus on driving top and bottom line, we've made notable changes to two key events, our anniversary sale and holiday. As we discussed previously, the priorities for anniversary are to improve customer satisfaction, drive sales and increase profitability. Customer feedback from this year's event was positive, significantly raising satisfaction scores. We curated the assortment by building more depth in key brands and items, driving higher sell-throughs. As a result, we had fewer mark downs on anniversary product in the third quarter, which contributed substantially to merchandize margin.","For the holidays, we are meaningfully expanding our gifting offer across Full Price and Off Price, and making it easier for customers to find gifts by recipient and price point. We're also making shopping more convenient with services, such as free next day shipping, 24\/7 order pickup and complementary gift wrapping.","The momentum in our Off Price business delivered positive sales growth on less inventory. We also increased turns for the eighth consecutive quarter and exceeded bottom line expectations. We've been purposeful about improving inventory flow, refining product allocation and emphasizing merchandise that's seasonally relevant. Our favorable inventory position allows us to be opportunistic in the marketplace, and leads to having a good flow of new product for customers to discover.","Another way we're leveraging inventory is through our market strategy. The investments in digital capabilities, along with assets of people, product and place, enable us to serve customers on their terms. Our goal is to gain market share while driving customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. There are two elements to this strategy. First, we're giving customers greater merchandise selection with faster delivery without increasing inventory levels. Second, we're engaging with customers by offering express services, such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional locations.","We first launched our market strategy in Los Angeles, our largest market, where results are exceeding expectations. Third quarter sales growth outpaced other markets by 100 basis points. In LA, the growth in customers shopping in stores and online was also 100 basis points higher than our average. We anticipate that these customers will increase their spend by four-times. Additionally, merchandise sell-throughs were higher in these stores than in other markets, contributing to profitability.","We recently rolled out our market strategy in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas. In a broader New York City market, customers now have faster access to inventory across eight full line stores, including our flagship and our fulfillment center. This represents seven times more selection available for same day pickup or next day delivery.","Leveraging existing store assets and digital capabilities enabled us to implement their shared inventory approach without making additional material investments. Order pickup is our most profitable transaction and the fourth quarter accounts for 40% of its volume. This represents a meaningful opportunity to increase convenience for customers during the holidays and at a lower cost for us.","Going forward, we're accelerating this strategy to our remaining top 10 markets by the end of 2020 through our continued focus on shared inventory and access to services. This includes plans to open more Nordstrom local service hubs in Los Angeles and New York. We will leverage additional Rack locations to offer express services, such as order pickup, returns and alterations.","And finally, we opened our New York City flagship store on October 24th. We've seen strong customer response with 85,000 visits during the opening weekend alone. New York City represents our largest online market, and we expect to see a halo effect when we open a physical location. Already, the sales uptick in the men's store is exceeding expectations.","In addition, one of Nordstrom's key points of difference is the breadth of our merchandise assortment, which creates an inclusive shopping experience. Customers at this store have responded to our offering and top performing brands include Nordstrom Maze Labels, Topshop, Nike, Canada Goose, Louis Vuitton and Valentino. Opening this flagship has been perhaps the most important milestone in our company's long history. It is a combination of efforts across so many people, and we are grateful to them all.","First of all, to the many Nordstrom alumni who over the years established the reputation with customers and as an employer that allowed the opportunity to be there for us and to our current team across the company, our business is about team and this has never been more true. We are proud of their dedication and passion to bring this store Nordstrom life. Pete and I feel most fortunate to work with so many talented, caring and hardworking people.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Anne to discuss our financial results and expectations for the remainder of the year.","Anne Bramman","Thanks Erik. For the third quarter, we reported EPS of $0.81, exceeding our expectations. We made meaningful progress in improving the customer service and continuing our operational discipline. The consistent strength of our inventory and expense execution contributed to EBIT margin expansion for the quarter. We are delivering on our strategy while driving top and bottom line results.","Third quarter sales decreased 2.2% in line with expectation. Full Price decreased 4.1% and Off Price increased 1.2%. Sales trends improved by more than 200 basis points from the first half of the year. We saw broad based improvement across Full Price and Off Price, driven by actions we\u2019re taking related to loyalty, digital marketing and merchandize assortment. Digital sales represented 34% of our business, up 300 basis points from a year ago. We saw sequential improvement in digital trends throughout the quarter, mostly notably at nordstorm.com.","Customer satisfaction of course our royalty program continued to rebound, and digital marketing efforts are driving traffic. As we rebalance our merchandize assortment, we are increasing depth in key items in Full Price, and accelerating seasonal receipts in Off Price. All merchandize divisions in both businesses improved relative to the first half of the year.","Our gross profit rates increased by 100 basis points over last year. We had fewer markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management in Off Price and higher sell through of anniversary product in Full Price. We ended the quarter in a favorable inventory position, down 2.7%. And, we maintained a positive spread between sales and inventory for the third consecutive quarter.","Our strong expense discipline drove our third quarter earnings beat. Expenses were down 2% from last year, excluding the credit charge in 2018 and pre-opening expenses to the New York City flagship. As a reminder, we planned $35 million in pre-opening expenses, of which roughly $10 million was incurred in the first half and $25 million in Q3. We continue to reduce our fixed costs by realigning our support structure in stores, making end-to-end process improvements in supply chain and technology and minimizing discretionary spend.","Year-to-date, we have achieved $170 million in savings and expect to well exceed our plans of $150 million to $200 million for the year. Our financial position remains strong. We apply a consistent approach that balances reinvesting the business and returning capital to shareholders. For the past several years, we have made significant investments in new markets and in digital capabilities to fuel future growth.","With the opening of the New York City Flagship, we\u2019re exiting this generational investment cycle. As a result, we expect CapEx to slow down from 6% of sales this year to 3% to 4% beginning in 2020. This reflects a normalized level, inclusive of our market strategy investments related to technology, supply chain and additional Nordstrom locals. We anticipate that moderating CapEx will accelerate free cash flow next year.","We remain committed to our investment grade credit rating. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.8 times, and we expected it to be roughly 2.7 times by the end of the year in line with 2018. On November 6th, we issued $500 million in debt and in early December, we expect to use the proceeds to fully retire the outstanding May 2020 notes. A onetime financing charge of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter is not included in our revised EPS outlook.","Turning to our expectations for the full year. We updated our EPS outlook by raising the lower end of our range by $0.05. We're maintaining our annual expectations for a sales decrease of approximately 2%. We expect SG&A dollars to be down roughly 1% for the year when excluding last year's credit charge. Gross profit rate is expected to be relatively flat. As you may recall, we planned sales growth in the second half to reflect 400 basis points improvement from the first half, and we are on track to meet these expectations.","For the fourth quarter the New York City Flagship is expected to contribute approximately 150 basis points of growth, and the remainder is evenly waited across three drivers, merchandise assortment, loyalty and digital marketing. As a reminder, gross profit is expected to deleverage from occupancy costs for the New York City Flagship. Merchandize margin rate is planned flat, which contemplates a continued promotional environment.","To wrap up, we're pleased with our third quarter results. We've made significant strides in delivering on our strategy and we're encouraged by the customer response. Our achievements, including strong Off Price execution, improved anniversary economics, success of our market strategy and the New York City Flagship, reflect continued focus on the customers and operating discipline. I will now turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we would appreciate if you can limit to one question to allow everyone a chance to ask a question. Also as a reminder, the company does not plan to comment on its 8-K filing on October 28th. We will now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Omar Saad with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask some follow-ups around the omnichannel initiatives, what you're seeing in local market strategy, dive in a little bit deeper in New York and I think you now rolled out San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago. What's different New York base from what you learned in Los Angeles? And it seems to be really feeding into this overall improvement in the profitability of the company as these capabilities come online. Is that the right way to think about it in the next year as you expand to even further new markets? Thanks.","Erik Nordstrom","Let me start at the end. I think the way to think about, number one, is it resonates with customers. And you know these strategies work if it doesn\u2019t resonate with customers. A lot of customers, all the customers like more selection and receiving things faster. But a good chunk of customers like the control of picking up at store, be it apartment without a doorman, or things you can store at their porch, or they want to try it on before they take it home, having that alternative means a lot. Secondly, how you should think about after customer relevance. It's really about leveraging for the most part the existing assets that we have to serve the customers better. So it\u2019s a really efficient for us.","Our biggest investment is inventory and inventory in stores in particular and that inventory in stores is close to customers. So being able to leverage that inventory to give customers bigger selection at a faster delivery is terrific, but it also helps efficiency of our inventory significantly. I think what we\u2019ve learned in New York so far and I think it makes sense. We opened two local service hubs in September, and the traffic to those have ramped, both those has ramped up much faster than what we saw in Los Angeles. It's just more intuitive to customers who live in New York that they\u2019re not getting in their SUV and drive to a parking lot, so to be able to have neighborhood service hub where they can do returns and pickups and alternations, customers get it immediately. Now our traffic in those locations with the locals has been very strong. And it\u2019s also we\u2019re utilizing our Manhattan Rack locations as well for those services and the uptake on those services has significantly exceeded our expectations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. Please proceed.","Oliver Chen","Regarding rebalancing the assortment and merchandize, what are your thoughts about that opportunity ahead? And will that continue to be an opportunity into next year? And as we think about digital -- both digital market and your digital sales growth, how should we model that line and what inning are you in with refinement of digital marketing, which I\u2019m sure is very dynamic?","Anne Bramman","So Pete, do you want to take the rebalancing assortment and I will -- Erik maybe if I can [indiscernible] the digital marketing\u2026","Pete Nordstrom","Sure. Oliver, it's Pete. In terms of balance our assortments and relative to price points, I guess what I'd say about that is we\u2019re really in innings of it, because we really landed on the strategy and tactically got after a couple of months ago, but the lead time are pretty long it's just in the Full Price part of the business but it\u2019s not something you can effect very short-term, because largely what you're dealing with are MSRPs and so it's not how we bring in and choose to market down, it's coming in at a regular price. And so it really has to do with the assortment and the selection upfront.","I think it\u2019s as long as we can, we will do this to continue to ground our efforts and actions around the customer data so that we have more objective view. And I think it's good, take us to the right place and what you should expect to see is continuous improvement on those lines over the next several months. We\u2019re not here to declare victory that we get at all aces at this moment, but I think we have a clear understanding of how to more surgically implement our buys in a way that's going to benefit the business. So we feel good about what we're working on there.","Erik Nordstrom","Let me take a stab and Anne can follow on the digital subject you asked. The big drivers in our digital sales growth loyalty, digital marketing and merchandising, and we've talked about the last couple of quarters where we're at with the journey on those. Loyalty has made significant progress all through the year program there and we're seeing that with increased engagement online with our loyalty customers. Digital marketing is becoming more productive for us. We're seeing increased traffic online and we believe there's still some runway there. The merchandise piece having the right balance, Pete just touched on.","The other comment I'd just make on are digital sales is, we view digital sales as a mean to an end and at both the end of in and of itself. And what that means is we look at digital assets or other assets, how do we get to where we can serve customers better and often in unique ways. I'm not going to tie it back to our market strategy. I think some good example is how much order pickup in stores is driving online sales growth. So overall for the quarter one half of our digital sales growth came from order pickup. And in Los Angeles, where we're most advanced in our market strategy, it was two thirds of our digital sales growth came from in store or pickup. So that's going to be a big part moving forward and we are like barely in the first inning on that one.","Oliver Chen","Just to follow up, New York's competitive market and you've been really holding your own. What are your thoughts regarding the promotional environment in New York and department store closures that we've been having here?","Pete Nordstrom","It's Pete. The promotional thing is something that we've got to be reactive to, and there's all kinds of factors going on out there. It's probably, and I think Anne mentioned one of the wild cards in terms of how we predict or how we are going to end up with this next quarter. We like the momentum that we're on and everything, but it's difficult for us to predict exactly what's going to happen with the promotional part of the business.","So I guess what I can tell you about that as we pay close attention, we're monitoring what's going on everywhere and we're working closely with vendors to make sure that whatever adjustments we need to make we can make them quickly and so that customers feel like they can trust our pricing and everything. So it's just part of our ongoing long term strategy about making sure they're really staying close to it. And I wish I had a cleaner answer for you there. There are factors that we are having with others that really are in our control, so we have to be a bit of reactive to both.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Edward Yruma","Just real quickly on the digital sales, I know you guys have indicated that sales have accelerated intra quarter. I know that you've been doing performance marketing into loyalty. But kind of maybe any more color you can give on why the department has accelerated? And then as a follow up to the previous questions on local. As you think about for longer term opportunity to rollout local, how quickly do you think you can move now that you've tested the different types of cities and markets? Thank you.","Erik Nordstrom","So digital sales -- I guess, in addition I'll comment Oliver's question in stock rates has been another area in our merchandise mix we have focused on. And we've made good progress on that over the last quarter definitely contribute to part of the momentum that you see in our results. As far as the speed of the local rollout, we went into the quarter. Our plan was to expand our market strategy to New York. So adding Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, was something we were able to do ahead of our plans. And it reflects that we came pretty quickly on it. There is not a material capital investment to expand into other markets. It is mostly a story of leveraging existing assets.","There is some work to be done. We can't just flip it on there. There is some systems work and certainly some operational work to prepare. Our plan is to -- we're in five of our top 10 markets now and our plan is to have this market strategy rolled out to the rest of our top 10 markets by the end of next year. And we will be pushing that as fast as we can.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Alex Walvis","I had a question on the inventory management coming in again below sales this quarter. Can you talk about how happy you are with the composition of level of that going into the holiday period? And then just related to that, I think that you said that the merch margin guide was around flat for the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the puts and takes there? And you know if that kind of surprises one way or another, what would be the drive there?","Anne Bramman","So I\u2019m going to take the first part of it, Alex and Pete, feel free to enhance the answer. So on the holiday, so coming into our inventory position, overall, we are very, very pleased. I think as both Erik and I referred to you in our comments, in particular our Off Price business has done an remarkable job of increasing their inventory turns of much I think more fluid flow model, being very opportunistic in the market place as far as seasonal relevant goods in the Off Price space. And that\u2019s really reflected in what we're seeing in the top line and bottom line results.","So we talked about that. We also talked about the fact in Q3, the sell through in our anniversary product we had few markups in sell-throughs, which really high -- which is very intentional part of our anniversary strategy. So that certainly helped our merchandize margin rate in Q3. And we did see a highly promotional environment, but those two factors between anniversary mark down and our Off Price business really helped offset any promotional headwinds we might have seen in that quarter.","In the fourth quarter going into from holiday prospective, we've actually pulled forward some of our holiday receipts. We've set holiday gifting. If you go on our site or in our stores, you'll see that we have a very deliberate message on gifting at certain price points just for the customer and what they are looking for, because we know from our customer feedback people buy at certain times for certain people at certain price points, and we've really tailored the strategy and the inventory levels to match that.","And so you're seeing that both in our Off Price business and in our Full Price business, and so we're --. I would also say that we've got -- we're very encouraged by the early reads we're seeing in our gifting strategy as we set that early as we did last year.","Pete Nordstrom","The only color I would add to that is, our inventory is in really good position, and we got there the right way, we didn\u2019t do it through a bunch of markdowns to get ourselves in line or cancelling a bunch of things. As Anne I mentioned, because we've been achieving our plans and having a lot of discipline around our execution of our plan has allowed us to pull inventory forward, to be responsive what's going on with the traffic in the stores. And it's certainly helpful to our top line and being in a fluid position as we go forward like this just create so much more flexibility and I think opportunity for us that we feel good that we've gotten there in a really healthy way with the business, and that should pay benefits as time goes on too.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Paul Trussell","You spoke to the Off Price business having some better execution. During the quarter, obviously, turning positive on the top line, but also having some better than expected bottom line results. Could you just discuss that a bit more?","Erik Nordstrom","We went into the year seeing actually more opportunity on the bottom line and the top line with plenty of initiatives around both. But we had good performance profitability wise in Off Price all through the year. But third quarter the top line really changed its trajectory, and it really is broad based. I mean it starts with having sales increases on less inventory and Anne touched on this in Off Price in particular being fluid so you can be opportunistic for buys in the marketplace.","And I think in particular the environment we're in right now, there is great merchandise at great prices out there if you have the open divide to get after and our team certainly did that. The result of that is we have more newness in our mix, it's more seasonally relevant. And again, we're seeing faster turns and higher margins. There is elements in the store and execution that we've seen since conversion improvements, there is elements online, our Rack.com and HauteLook business, there's digital marketing, again through the merchandise offer, through flash events, really across the board improvements in traffic and conversion.","Paul Trussell","And just a quick follow up on the updated outlook. Is the adjustment to EBIT and EPS solely a reflection of exceeding your own expectations for the third quarter, or has there been any adjustments made to your prior view for the fourth quarter? And I noticed that the interest expense, I think, remains guided towards $110 million, but you've only done $66 million to-date. Maybe just touch on the outlook please.","Anne Bramman","So yes, as you mentioned, we did tightened the bottom end of our range and it really is an output from what we exceed in our own expectations for the quarter. So our view is not changed in the fourth quarter. And as you heard from the Q&A from our opening commentary, we are executing -- and the levers that we've been pulling and the drivers that we have in our business, we're continuing to deliver on what we set out for the second half of the year.","As far as the interest expense, you are right, the fourth quarter does top. I'd just remind you that we do have large capital projects we do capitalized interest. And I think you guys are aware, we opened a very large investment in New York in Q3. So as that comes online, that interest would not be capitalized going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Jay Sole with UBS. Please proceed.","Jay Sole","Just on the New York store. Do you feel like it's opened up at like say 100% of the productivity that you will see, or do you expect that there'd be a ramp up period of a year or two? And then secondly, Anne, on just the SG&A space. By the end of 4Q, will the company have realized all -- with the run rate of savings that you got completely realized, so it's a $200 million or $210 million whatever it's going to be. Will that be it or will there probably be more going into Q1? Thanks so much.","Anne Bramman","Let me take the SG&A first and then Pete why don't you take New York. So on the SG&A, there will be a tail going into 2020 we haven't qualified that and we'll include that as part of our 2020 guidance at the end of next year. What I would say more broadly though is that we are continuing to look for opportunities to drive productivity and efficiencies in our business. I think you've heard us talk about this quite a bit, particularly with the generational investments as we continue scale, we will get more closer on that.","And we are also looking -- as you know, we're been making lot of investment in digital capabilities. So we're continually looking for ways to gain scale and productivity in those areas as well going forward. So I would say we had a very strong operating discipline on this year, and I would say we're not done.","Pete Nordstrom","This is Pete, relative to New York and the productivity and what to expect going forward. Now one of the benefits Erik and I have, this has been around a long time. And I think between the two, we've seen, I don't know, 80 store openings in our time. And as a result of that, we have really good contacts and analogs around how to expect the maturity of stores and how long that takes. Our brand New York has got its own thing. But I think in terms of being able to grow into its full potential, we got a few years there to be able to do that.","We're not rationalizing, we're settling for something -- anything less than the best we can possibly do between now and then. But it's safe to say that even after a great and start everything that we fully anticipate that we will grow over the next, call it three or so years and do more of a mature position. And there's still things to learned there. There is a lot of improvements we can make and customers get to know us better. So it all feels super promising right now.","Jay Sole","And then maybe if I can just ask one more on the Full Price stores, because it sounds like, so digital was up seven, overall Full Price was down four, you closed about six stores year-over-year. What kind of contribution was closing the stores to that overall sales growth number for the Full Price stores -- for the Full Price business in total? Because otherwise, like it looks like the Full Price stores were down like high singles, and sort of wondering if that's like the real run rate, or if that's sort of a combination of different factors that don't really represent the comp, which is obviously something that people are actually going to think about.","Anne Bramman","So let me -- so the digital sales number that we gave to total JWN that includes beyond our Full Price also includes our Off Price business as well. We did call out that we saw demand improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in nordstrom.com. And so when we look at closing stores, I think we've talked to you guys about how we look at this, but it's generally at the end of an operating covenant or operating model, we look at the return we get we invest in that store, and also what was going on in that market, particularly what's going on in that mall, so typically stores that get close to pretty small volume stores, and so it's not a significant impact to the top line overall for the company. I would also remind you there are stores -- all of our stores are cash flow positive. So from a contribution margin, they actually -- we don't have any that would be -- are cash flow negative, even the ones that we closed.","Erik Nordstrom","I would just -- this is Erik. I would just add to it and connected to our market strategy. We're early days on it but we're seeing so far when we can connect a whole markets worth of inventory. Proportionally, the small stores benefit the most, and I think that makes sense. It's the biggest increase in inventory of what's available for next day delivery, or next day by in-store -- buy online pickup in-store.","So I think the point there is we're learning a lot, and the feet of small stores is not sealed or determined. And as part of what we're excited about with our market strategy is the convenience, the kind of intimacy of a smaller store that customers like, if we can materially change the selections available to them, then those stores could be on a different trajectory. And so we still need to play that out and see what happens there.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Connor Konicke with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Connor Konicke","This is Connor on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. I know you touched on the anniversary event in prepared remarks. But any more color there and maybe some of the key learnings you can take into the holiday quarter?","Pete Nordstrom","It's Pete. I think it's another example of where we use objective data and analysis to make smarter decisions. We've been doing the Anniversary thing for a long time and you would think that, that practical experience would give us all we need, but the changing landscape relative to how much more online business we've done in the past, and it grows disproportionately and we have more online business at that time, if that happens in anniversary also happens in holiday that it impacts really the profitability of event.","So it felt great that we went into it with the plan and to improve really the bottom-line performance, and that has worked. I will tell you that we weren't able to get after this plan early enough to fully impact, I think what's possible with that event. So I think the good news is that event went very well and there is a lot of reason to believe that we will be able to improve upon it again for next year, because we have the full year to be able to plan for it.","So I think what that implies for holiday, there is a lot of similarities and that there's time bound events and there is very specific actions related to price and category that are applicable from anniversary to the holiday time. So we believe that we've got some proof there that we're on the right track and with the right strategy, and it's nice to see kind of how our teams responded all that and their confidence about how to attack holiday and again anniversary next year on the heels of what was the successful anniversary. So it's all been positive so far.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Tracy Kogan with Citi. Please proceed.","Tracy Kogan","I was wondering if you could talk about the performance of your stores in Canada, both the full-line stores and the Rack stores, and how they performed relative to your expectations. And then also what do the four-wall margins look like there compared to the U.S.? And then I just wanted to have a quick follow-up on something you said about using your Rack locations in your local strategy. I was wondering if you could give more color on that. Thanks.","Anne Bramman","So I'll take some of the Canada questions and Erik do you want to take the Rack conversation. So in general, we report Canada as part of our generational investments, so we don't specifically break out. For example Canada, we aren't going to break out New York in particular and then -- the other two of our generational investments, our Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook.com, as well as TrunkClub. And so what I would say is, in general, when we look at our generational investments for the year, they are absolutely in line with our expectations that we laid out earlier this year for both the top and a bottom line perspective.","Tracy Kogan","Was there anything specifically you could say about the Canada stores, relative to your expectation just broadly?","Anne Bramman","So again, I would just revert you back to our generational investments and they're progressing as we -- and we've also talked about the fact that we're going to continue to get scale and leverage in those investments as we continue to grow.","Tracy Kogan","Thank you.","Erik Nordstrom","This is Erik. To add a little color to my comment on store, the role our Rack stores can play with our market strategy. We did in New York -- I'd step back and say we approached New York as expanding our market capabilities versus opening a four-wall store. Now our flagship store is a tremendous asset to add to the market, but it's as we mentioned, Manhattan is our largest market for online sales. We opened two local service hubs. We had two Rack stores there, as well as a TrunkClub clubhouse.","So we've been expanding for a bit now of having express returns in Rack stores, where customers can return Full Price merchandise. And in New York, we expand that to, not only be able to do returns from any of our businesses, but to do order pick-ups from any of our businesses or nordstrom.com, buy online pickup in-store and we have alterations available as well. The response to that has exceeded our expectations. We thought it was going to be good. It's been especially good.","So we put a plan together to roll that out to more Racks', but we'll share that with you once we have that set. The other piece, I would just remind you again like M&A, it starts with giving customers things they like. And a lot of customer the convenience of going into a Rack, they really appreciate. So on the business side, getting customer engagement across channels drives a lot of value.","When our customer goes from engaging with us in one of our businesses to two their spend with us increases 4x. And if we get engagement all four, so that four in-stores Nordstrom.com, Rack stores, Rack.com, their spend goes up 11x. So there's a lot of value there that we're excited about.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Binetti","Congrats on a nice quarter and on New York. Anne, I think you originally described second half sales to accelerate by 400 basis points and fairly evenly split between four initiatives, New York being one of them. It sounds like you now expect New York to be about 150 basis points, if I heard you right. And it sounds like you saw Rack accelerate a little more than what you were thinking in the quarter. You seem pleased there. The compares get easier and the comparison Rack physical stores since we have those data points last year get a couple of hundred basis points easier. So the momentum in a few key areas here is maybe better than you thought. Any new takes you tried to embrace as you looked at the year that kept you from raising the target in fourth quarter for your comments earlier given the momentum in the business there?","Anne Bramman","So just to clarify, the 400 basis points and in particular in New York with a 100 basis points for the second half, and so what I try to do is give you a little bit more context on what the impact is for the fourth quarter, because the store opened last week of the quarter and so primarily, the sales are in the fourth quarter piece. So I was just trying to give you some context of those different levers to, but the overall levers, if you look at second half haven't changed with the 100 basis points across the four things that we talked about. As far as Rack, it's doing well, the business overall do well, but we have a lot of the quarter left, we have a lots of year left to deliver a big holiday season and we also -- in my comments, try to incorporate the fact that it's going to be competitive and highly promotional holiday season, we believe, and so we want to make sure that we were continuing to deliver on our expectations.","Michael Binetti","Can I follow up that and ask you on that directly, on the merch margins. I think you said you plan them flat or up in the fourth quarter, if I got that right. Maybe just walk us through few of the components, is New York and is the impact for New York positive to merch margins and then maybe you could help us put some kind of a basis point quantification? How much better the margins are around the end of Anniversary sale. I mean you said, there is lower inventories and you don't have to clear as much there in third quarter. I think that goes away as a tailwind in 4Q. I guess, around the competitive space, we've heard pretty conservative assumptions on merchandise margins. So I wanted to just check and see how you built up or you guide to for fourth quarter.","Anne Bramman","So we did guide -- we thought merch margins will be relatively flat for the fourth quarter, and we did include into that guidance, competitive and highly promotional environment. I think you've heard from, I think all three of us. Given our inventory position going in the quarter, and given where we really focused on our gifting assortment, and in particular the flow and sell-through in Off-Price, but also in Full-Price as we really have been executing Holiday strategy, leveraging the learnings and the data and analytics Anniversary in the holiday, and some of the encouraging signs we're seeing as we set holiday early. We've incorporated all of that into our guidance and feel very comfortable where we are.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Heather Balsky","This is Heather on for Lorraine Hutchinson, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit in terms of the profitability impact you're seeing in LA from the local strategy. What are you seeing in terms of any gross margin improvement, and the SG&A leverage that you've mentioned that you're seeing better profitability from higher sales, so just curious if you can dig into that?","Erik Nordstrom","I mean, directionally, it is positive. We're getting higher sell-throughs, its more efficiency of our inventory investment. We can extend that inventory investment that's in all of our stores there and spread it to demand for next day delivery or next day pickup in-store across all of the stores. So it's early, we need to go through a full year certainly, but right now, we didn't know, we're seeing higher sell-throughs, that's encouraging.","Well, there is puts and takes on the expense part of it, but overall for us, I would say, we see a significant upside in profitability. And I think part of the story, just of our execution of this again goes around inventory, our OpEx investments in inventory, which is our biggest cost can be markdown. So it's able to move that merchandise around in a marketplace in almost every case, some extra handling to get an incremental sale and avoid a markdown as well worth it.","Trina Schurman","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

Nordstrom","Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin, we recognize that a number of you, along with many of our employees, customers and millions of others, have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our thoughts go out to all of those who have suffered and those still dealing with the effects of the storm. While we know it takes time, it's heartening to see how the communities in the Northeast are beginning to rebuild.","We'd like to transition into providing an update on our progress for the quarter and how we're making headway with various growth initiatives. As Rob mentioned, we have some slides available for you to follow along with our comments. We are encouraged with our progress to date and how the customer is responding, as reflected in our top line performance, with 12 consecutive quarters of same-store sales increases. We are experiencing continued strength across all areas of our business.","As a company, we aspire to continually improve the customer experience. There's no finish line when it comes to this subject as our customers have access to a growing number of choices, with expectations increasingly centered on speed and convenience. Their expanding view of service and our desire to increase our relevance with existing and new customers are creating multiple growth opportunities, whether in stores or through technology.","Just as we're striving to provide a differentiated experience in our stores, we're also working to achieve this in e-commerce. Speed, selection and convenience are critical to delivering a best-in-class online experience.","Our Direct business continues to drive outside sales growth, achieving an impressive increase of 38% this quarter, on top of last year's third quarter 33% growth. It's encouraging that the third quarter increase was achieved while going up against last year's launch at the end of August of free shipping and returns online. We believe that the continued strength in e-commerce reflects the investments we are making to expand our capabilities.","In September, we announced 2 full-line store openings in 2014 at St. Johns Town Center in Jacksonville and a second store at Woodlands Mall in the Houston area.","We are also excited about our recently announced expansion into Canada. Our initial plan is to open 4 full-line stores in the Calgary, Ottawa, Vancouver and Toronto markets. Canada represents a terrific growth opportunity as a potential to someday have 7 to 9 full-line stores, as well as a number of Racks.","At the Rack, we delivered an 18% increase in total Rack sales on a year-to-date basis. During the third quarter, same-store sales grew 8.1%, marking the highest increase since 2007.","We successfully opened 7 Rack stores in the third quarter. Today, we opened our doors at 2 more Racks in Warwick, Rhode Island and in Seattle, bringing our total to 15 new stores and 3 relocations for the year. We recently shared with you our plans to accelerate our Rack openings, and we are on track to go from 119 stores today to over 230 stores by 2016.","Underlying this growth is our belief in the ability to increase market share and leverage our strong operating model to procure the best product and expand into both existing and new markets.","In addition, during the quarter, we successfully rolled out mobile point-of-sale devices to all of our Rack stores. Our Rack team's execution is a great example of how we can elevate the service experience by reducing lines and improving speed at checkout, which in turn will drive incremental volume.","We continue to focus on increasing relevance with existing and new customers. We know that newness is important to our customers. In September, we began carrying merchandise from Topshop in 14 of our stores as well as online. We are encouraged with the early response from customers. We're learning a lot, and our partnership with Topshop is one way we can provide new on-trend fashion at accessible prices.","In closing, our overarching goal is to improve the customer experience. It's providing us with multiple growth opportunities, locations, channels, convenience, speed, delivery, and we are encouraged by the progress we're making.","Now, I'll turn over the call to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel","Thanks, Blake. Our focus on delivering a differentiated experience to our customer continues to create multiple growth opportunities, from strengthening our service and product offering to capturing additional growth through e-commerce, store expansion and new markets. We remain committed to executing a disciplined, measured growth strategy and driving long-term shareholder value. While our business model evolves, consistent with our desire to be the retailer of choice across all channels, we believe it will continue to deliver sustainable growth and high returns.","Now I'd like to review our third quarter financial results. As a reminder, our third quarter results reflected the shift of our Anniversary Sale event, which created a favorable comparison to this quarter and an unfavorable comparison in the second quarter. As a result, we expected to see earnings accelerate in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year. For the third quarter, our earnings per diluted share of $0.71 increased 20% compared to the same period in 2011. Earnings before interest and income taxes, or EBIT, totaled $277 million, which was an increase of 15% over last year.","Next I'd like to discuss sales. The strength in our third quarter sales performance was broad-based across all channels and multiple merchandise categories. Total net sales in the quarter increased 14%, and same-store sales increased 10.7%. Same-store sales for the combined second and third quarters increased 7.3%, which removes the impact of the Anniversary Sale event shift.","Nordstrom same-store sales, which consist of our full-line and direct businesses, were up 11.2%, with men's shoes, men's apparel and kids' apparel as our top-performing merchandise categories. We are also encouraged with the recent sales increase in women's apparel, which outperformed the multi-channel average this quarter for the first time in recent history. Same-store sales at full-line increased 8.1%, with the Midwest and Northwest as our top-performing regions.","Direct continues to be our fastest-growing channel, driving sales growth of 38%, on top of last year's 33% increase. Nordstrom Rack continues to achieve strong top line growth, with same-store sales of 8.1% and total sales of 16.3%.","Now I'd like to discuss our gross profit performance. Third quarter gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 37 basis points over last year to 36.2%. The decrease was primarily due to increased benefits related to our enhanced Fashion Rewards program. This program plays an important part in building customer loyalty as our Fashion Rewards members shop more frequently and spend more with us than non-members. With the launch of our enhanced program earlier this year, we have been pleased with our customer response as reflected by increases in new accounts, rewards spend and Nordstrom card penetration compared with last year. To date, we have 3.1 million active members in the program, which represented a 22% increase over last year.","Let's move on to inventory. Total sales per square foot increased 10.8%, reflecting the shift in the Anniversary Sale. When removing the impact of the shift, the increase in total sales per square foot was in line with our ending inventory per square foot increase of 7.4%. For the 12th consecutive quarter, the percentage of regular price sales increased relative to last year, which reflects our customers' continuing preference for newness and the ongoing benefits from our multichannel capabilities.  Our inventory turn of 5.1x was slightly down from last year, reflecting Rack's growth.","Next I'd like to discuss our expense performance. As expected, we experienced improvements in expense leverage in the third quarter. Retail SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales, decreased 30 basis points over last year to 27.9%. The leverage achieved was slightly lower than anticipated, impacted by a timing shift of expenses from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. When we look at our store business, we continue to deliver incremental profits on incremental sales that are in line with recent historical performance.","Moving on to Credit. We continue to see improving trends in our credit metrics. Our deliquency rate improved to 2.1% of receivables versus 2.8% last year. We ended the quarter with bad debt reserves as a percent of ending credit card receivables of 4.5%, down from 6.2% last year. Based on the overall performance of the credit portfolio, we reduced our reserve for bad debt by $10 million. We will continue to monitor credit trends to ensure we are appropriately reserved.","Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion of cash and liquidity of $2 billion. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA of 2.1x is well within the range of investment grade.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $55 for a total of $85 million. We have $612 million remaining under our existing authorization.","Now I will discuss our updated outlook for 2012, factoring in our year-to-date performance. We are updating our expectations to achieve 2012 earnings per diluted share of between $3.45 and $3.50 from $3.40 to $3.50. In addition, our full-year same-store sales guidance is between 6.5% to 7% from 6% to 7%. While this guidance considers the impacts of Hurricane Sandy, there remains uncertainty, and we will continue to monitor trends in the affected areas.","Our updated gross profit outlook is consistent with prior guidance, reflecting the impact of multiple growth initiatives under way. We anticipate retail SG&A to be $340 million to $355 million higher than last year. This falls within the high end of the range we previously shared and results in meaningful improvement in expense leverage for the fourth quarter.","In closing, we continue to be encouraged with the momentum in our business. As we begin the fourth quarter, we remain confident in our ability to elevate the customer experience through the execution of our growth initiatives. Based on our progress to-date, we are on track to achieve our long-term financial goals of high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens return on invested capital.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] With that, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question today is from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As we think about the holiday season, as you guys are moving to more mobile POS, how will that impact labor? And especially in the Rack stores, does that give you the opportunity to bring in more merchandise?","Erik B. Nordstrom","This is Erik. Deborah, can you repeat that? I missed part of it.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As we think about the holiday season and as you're doing more with mobile POS, how does that impact your labor? And in the Rack stores, does that give you an opportunity to bring in more merchandise as well?","Erik B. Nordstrom","Oh, yes. For the full-line stores, the mobile POS really hasn't affected our labor one way or the other. It's been neutral on that. For the Racks, to your point, it does free up space. Because as we're able to replace fixed registers that come with counters with mobile POS devices, we have the centralized checkouts upfront. We're actually able to pick up selling space right at the front of the store. So that's definitely a positive for us.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could provide metrics around the Fashion Rewards customers? Because obviously, it sounds like it significantly helped you drive some business around events, but also drive additional traffic, not only online but in stores as well.","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Deborah, this is Mike. As I noted in my comments, our total active Fashion Rewards customers is up 22% this year. We continue to see those customers outspend those that aren't part of the program and continue to see high growth, particularly in new accounts and debit card and in new customers that are shopping with us in the Rack. So I would tell you, across all metrics, including total increased average spend, et cetera, we continue to see progress with Fashion Rewards.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I actually want to ask about the slide that's not in the deck. The slide from fourth quarter. I think you had kind of articulated really a vision for improved EBIT margins next year. Obviously you've announced a number of growth initiatives like doubling Rack store count, Canada, New York. How do we think about your longer-term business model as it relates to some of those outlines you've provided earlier this year?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, Ed, I think you're referring to that chart that we provided back in February, which was designed to be directional in terms of how we saw the company move over a longer period of time. We're not going to comment specifically about immediate improvement in margins in 2013. We'll do that in February. But I do think it's fair to say, as we did indicate, that we feel that we're right on track with the goals we set out in terms of a high-single-digit sales growth and a mid-teens return on invested capital. We are still seeing an evolution in the business model and the way it's performing. And as the Direct business continues to accelerate, there are more opportunities there and it is a higher, more current expense model than the traditional store model, and that is having some impact. But overall, the outcomes of all that are still going to drive similar economics over time.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And one follow-up question. Obviously, a nice improvement in the women's business. How much of that is due to the new leadership that you have in place? And maybe, how much of it is due to initiatives you've had kind of ongoing over the past year or so?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. I think Tricia Smith, who is our new leader in women's, deserves some credit for the improvements we've had, but a lot of those initiatives have been in place for quite some time. I think the biggest thing is just we've had an improved execution across the board, and that's probably been the most measurable part of what we've been able to achieve there. Our ongoing efforts around trying to get better aligned with customers and being more relevant based on their lifestyles and occasions has been something we've been working on for a while and will continue because we still have a lot of progress to make.","Operator","Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You talked about the growth in the customer rewards program. But could you talk about what percentage of the sales were made in third quarter with that card and that customer versus last year?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, the total penetration of Fashion Rewards is roughly 34%, 35% of our total sales.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last year?","Michael G. Koppel","It's up from -- I believe, it was a low 30 penetration, 32-ish.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Black from Jennifer Black and Associates.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","I wanted to know -- I know you talked about Topman and Topshop, and I know it's early. I just wondered when you think you might make decisions about rolling it out? And then I also wondered if you're seeing some differences as far as online purchases with that. And then I have a follow-up question.","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. It's done really well, and we've been really pleased with good results from what we've been able to achieve so far, and I think we're also pleased with our ability to react quickly and get this thing started from idea to actual execution. We did that pretty quickly. So what we're trying to do is be thoughtful about this period of time that we're in. It's the reason that we took on 14 stores for a specific period of time before we want to make future decisions about how to roll it out in a larger way. I think it's safe to say we will roll it out in a larger way, but we don't have any details for the scope and speed of that right now. I think that's something that we'll be able to figure out here in the next couple of months. But it's been very encouraging so far. And as it relates to online, that part of the business has been fantastic. It's all been very good.","Jennifer Black - Black & Company Inc., Research Division","So will you expand the assortment then online? Because I know you don't have the full assortment, at least I didn't think you did for Topshop and Topman.","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, I think so. I mean, again, it's an ongoing situation, but it's not dissimilar from any of the rest of the parts of our business. Where we have a chance to expand our selection online, we want to try to do that, particularly with brands and categories that are really important to our customers.","Operator","Our next next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned regular price selling continuing to improve. Can you just talk about where you are on that metric versus prior peaks? And any opportunities that you see going forward?","Michael G. Koppel","This is Mike. In terms of prior peaks, we don't specifically call out that metric. But it's the highest it's been. So we've continued to see improvement in our ability to sell at a regular price over time. And in terms of what the upside is, we just keep working hard at it. And hopefully, we continue that and keep our turns high and have the right product.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just the SG&A shift that you mentioned into the fourth quarter. What was that? And can you quantify the impact?","Michael G. Koppel","It was SG&A from 4 into 3, and it was primarily related to some marketing costs and some benefit-related cost. We're not going to specifically quantify it, but you'll see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Mike, following up a little bit on that gross profit question, maybe this is for Pete as well. I mean, clearly, women's apparel is a nice call out for you guys. Is this an opportunity to kind of take this very large category up in terms of higher and drive more of that full price selling? And a related question to that would just be what are you seeing from a resource perspective? I mean, obviously we've seen you guys mix really interesting and unique investments with Bonobos and Peek in non-women's apparel group. But are there opportunities within women's apparel where you can kind of do some very interesting sort of investments to kind of flush this out a little bit more?","Peter E. Nordstrom","It's Pete. I would say, if the women's business is healthy, that's a good thing for our business because it's a large part of our business. And if done right, it can be a good margin part of the business as well. So I think kind of back to my earlier point about execution, there's just a lot of opportunities for us to do it better. And we've got some pretty good momentum and some good traction now and we're just going to keep going. And it's definitely a positive indicator for our overall health of our business. In terms of the resources, I guess I want to understand specifically again, you were mentioning about opportunities to invest with some -- I'm sorry, I didn't get that part. Why don't you ask that specifically again?","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure, Pete. Just -- you guys have made some interesting partnerships with Bonobos and Peek, I think, is what we've observed out in the marketplace, and those are obviously not women's apparels resources. Are there opportunities within women's apparel, some kind of unique investments or partnerships that you can have going forward in women's apparel?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, sure. I think that there is -- based on the relationships we've been able to forge across all categories. And so Topshop would be an example of something that's done specifically around women's. And obviously, there's a men's component to that too, but the women's has been the bigger component. We were able to do a partnership with Jason Wu. We have a line coming out, the Miss Wu line, which will be unique to us, which really came as a result of the relationship we have with them. So we're trying to be opportunistic about that kind of stuff. And as those opportunities present themselves, we'll pursue them.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about -- everybody's talking about newness and fashion and flow, better flow. You guys are already one of the best in the business with your inventory turns. As online continues to grow, does the centralized inventory allow you to actually flow better? Or does it -- is it more like the stores lead and then you flow to the Internet channel? Is there any dynamic there?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, the multi-channel dynamic is where we actually are buying inventory specifically for online, as well as we're buying for store. And the most efficient way to do that is to place the inventory where the demand is. And to the extent we've got good information, good history, we're able to do that relatively well. But the advantage that we have is when we don't place it perfectly, which we never quite do, we're able to use the resource of the entire company. So it all happens in real time across the company. It's not like one is leading the other.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So it's kind of like one time, it might flow faster to the stores, and then you react another time and you might be faster online?","Peter E. Nordstrom","It's a bit of a balancing act. I think, with how fast the online part of our business has grown, that's where we've been trying to catch up a little bit.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So maybe in the future, your reaction time will shorten online?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, again, I don't think that quite characterizes it right. That's one leading the other. It's all kind of happening in exact real time. We have complete real-time view of the inventory across the entire company, regardless of what channel it's in.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez from Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a follow-up on an earlier question. You said rewards, new rewards customers outspend those not in the program. But how do new rewards customers spend relative to existing rewards customers? And is there a typical pattern of how they may start spending in year one versus how they behave throughout the next couple of years once they're in the program? And then just a follow-up on that SG&A shift, was that just a -- was that a shift in dollars of where the expense was recorded? Or was there actually a timing shift in how you loaded your marketing, doing more in the third quarter as opposed to the fourth quarter?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Paul, this is Mike. In terms of the rewards, we continue to see the average spend of rewards customers improve. So that's a positive. In terms of their spend over time, certainly the way the program is designed with the various levels, it's designed to get people to continue to spend up to achieve the higher rewards at the higher levels. So that's the way the program is designed. And this past year, we made it more accessible so we could -- so people could feel like they could reach each step with a lower incremental spend. And we've seen a lot of value with that. So we continue to learn from it. We continue to look at opportunities to improve it. And in terms of the SG&A, it was just a question of how the costs were incurred relative to this year and last year. I don't think there's any really big story there. I think we called it out only because relative to our plan, we expected the expense leverage should be slightly better and we wanted to be transparent about that.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Is that the entire reason that you didn't hit your plan?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, we did hit our plan relative to what we expected to do for the third quarter. I mean, the plan that I think -- are you referring to the consensus?","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I thought you just said that you expected it to be better. I was just wondering how [indiscernible]...","Michael G. Koppel","It was just the SG&A leverage. It was just the SG&A leverage.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And can you quantify the drag of what that hit you by?","Michael G. Koppel","No, we're not going to call it out specifically. You'll see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the credit side, I wanted to touch on that for a second, the bad debt reserve and the performance that you've seen. What's the best way to think about this going forward as we think about the fourth quarter and more so into next year? Can the credit portfolio continue to perform at this level? And what type of opportunity do we have on the reserve line?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Well, as you know, we don't really talk about opportunity as to how much lower the reserve could go because that is just a direct function of the performance of the portfolio. And to put it into some context, our delinquencies are roughly where they were in 2007 prior to the recession, and our write-offs are a little higher, but they continue to trend down although at a slower pace. So if we continue to see improvement in those metrics, we will follow our methodology and make the appropriate reductions. But clearly, in terms of where we are in the long-term scale and adjustment of the performance, we're likely at the tail end of it.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk about where you're at in the 5-year plan for your IT spend? Are you still aiming for about $140 million this year? And how much does that accelerate into next year?","Michael G. Koppel","I assume the $140 million you're quoting is the capital spend?","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. Sorry. The capital spend for IT.","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Yes. Well, we actually are in the process right now of reviewing our 5-year capital plan, and that includes our technology and the opportunities we see. So in terms of where we are, we continue to see opportunities to invest in technology, to improve not only our e-commerce operations but other areas of the business, which continue to scale upwards. So we'll give you a little bit more visibility on that in February after we finish that process.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That would be helpful. And then could you just talk a little bit about some of the prior outperformers? Obviously, women's apparel doing better is a very significant thing. But are you seeing any slowing or any hiccups with accessories, shoes, women's shoes and cosmetics? Or is it just kind of tough comparison and seeing some acceleration in some of the other categories?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. Actually, it's -- the different divisions are rather closely bundled together. We've had a lot of strength, as you mentioned, in women's and men's apparel, but it's not because accessories and shoes has done poorly. I mean, they're still doing really well. And then particularly, if you look at over multiple years, we've had really strong increases. So no, that hasn't dropped off really at all for us. That's continued on a very consistent, strong rate for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Caris & Company.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wondered if you could -- just talk a little bit about what -- kind of the way you see the holiday season. You're perhaps not as big a Black Friday business as some others. You're not giving away free TVs or anything like that. So just how do we look at sort of the November, December, how things kind of play out, when you typically see your most traffic? Just an idea of how you see the holiday season kind of laying out.","Erik B. Nordstrom","Okay. This is Erik. I think you should view it pretty similar to what our recent history has been. Last December was one of the best months we've had, both online and in our stores over our history. And it is -- you're right, it's not promotionally driven. The day after Thanksgiving is not as big a day as a proportion to our year as it is for some of our competitors, but it's certainly a busy day. That weekend is busy for us, and we get a lot of volume earlier in the month with some of our Fashion Rewards events we have in our stores. So the whole month is busy. But there has been somewhat of a trend over the years to where holiday shopping has pushed more closer and closer to Christmas, and that week after Christmas has been emerging as a more and more important time. Many years ago, that week after Christmas was almost purely a clearance time. And now, it really is a time -- for us, it is, of newness. We get a lot of shoppers who are coming in to buy for themselves, and they're not looking for the old stuff marked down. They're looking for the new stuff, and it's been a real healthy season for us.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great. And also, just on November, you've got Half-Yearly for women and kids, but those events have tended to be kind of more restrained given the great control on inventory that you've had. I'm assuming that, that continues to be the case.","Erik B. Nordstrom","Yes. It's pretty similar to what we've had over the years. We have less clearance for Half-Yearlies, but more so, it's not so much a supply-driven thing as a demand-driven thing. Our customers are not as interested in the older stuff that we're marking down for clearance as they are in the new stuff. So more of what's been growing in importance events has been our Fashion Rewards events. They are our best customers. And this year, one of the enhancements was customers being able to choose their own personal triple point days. That's something that customers asked us for. We were excited to be able to offer it. And it puts them in control and allows them to get these extra bonus points when they want it. And more and more, it's on regular-priced merchandise.","Operator","Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can talk about the improvement in your women's business. How broad-based is that improvement? Is it now trending in line with the rest of the chain? And are you seeing women trade off any other categories in the store in order to spend more on that apparel?","Peter E. Nordstrom","This is Pete. It's actually kind of surprisingly broad-based across literally almost every category we've been doing better and better. And as Mike mentioned in his comments on this last month, we had women's apparel growth of higher than the average, which it's been a while since we had that. So it's outpacing a little bit the other divisions. Now we have a ways to go, so that's a good part about it. Sorry, and the last part of your question was?","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is that spending on women's apparel coming at the expense of any other categories in the store?","Peter E. Nordstrom","No.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question for Mike is on the return on capital goal. It looks like, over the last 12 months, return on capital has run around 12.9%. You expressed a great degree of confidence in moving that into the mid-teens. And I'm wondering, what are the metrics that we should be looking for over the next 12, 18, 24 months that would give us the best indication that, that is moving in the right direction. Is it revenue acceleration beyond what you've delivered? Or is it margin metrics? What are the key levers to move that ROIC up into the mid-teens?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Well, Kimberly, thanks for the question. As always, the most important lever is going to be our top line growth. Because with top line growth, everything falls from that. And so as we said, our goal is to continue to achieve a high-single digit top line growth rate, and that's the first thing we should pay attention to. And then the next thing would be our ability to grow earnings dollars. So if we can continue to generate respective growth in earnings dollars, that will contribute to the return on capital. And then the last thing, and you're going to see that return on capital by the end of the year get back into roughly the 14% range, and most of the reason for that is that we've had some fairly high cash levels. And particularly, last year, it started to build and it's been high this year. And by the time we lap through the fourth quarter, you're going to see that come back up.","Operator","Our next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I'm curious about the -- and I know it's early, but -- how you're thinking about the investments for Canada and for the New York store. Oftentimes, when we see someone enter a major market like this, it does come with a fair amount of capital and expense. Are those things that you think could lead to heavier investment spending than typical? And when would we start to see that investment spending ramp?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Liz, this is Mike. Well, first, you're right. Building particularly in big urban locations is a higher capital commitment than in a traditional mall location. We should start seeing some of that capital in 2013, particularly some of the arrangements we have as it relates to Manhattan and then some of the beginning of building stores in Canada. Our expectation is that both of those strategies are going to deliver returns greater than our cost of capital. They may not be at the same level as a traditional mall store, but we do believe we're going to create value and we wouldn't have done them if it was otherwise.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then second question that also relates sort of to investment spending. I think I heard you say something along the lines of there is no finish line. Is that how you're thinking about sort of the investments in digital because it is such an evolving space and commitment? Or is there a finish line that you can see a few years out in terms of spending on digital?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes. Sure, Liz. Well, first, I think as a point of clarification, I believe the finish line comment was related to our ability to continue to improve in women's apparel versus our investment in digital spending. But all that being said, we continue to see opportunities there. And to know when the end line, I think -- I don't think anybody knows right now. We're in a period where there's a tremendous amount of change and evolution in the way technology is affecting the customer experience. And we want to be an exemplar there, and we're going to continue to invest to assure that we don't lose that status.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike, just to follow up on Paul's question earlier, just trying to understand the relationship here between comps and retail SG&A leverage. If I recall, back in August, you guys guided leverage of I think 55 to 75 bps on that high-single digit comp, yet you guys only delivered about 29 bps. So leverage when comps were up 11.1%. Just trying to understand the delta there. It looks like maybe 30 basis points to be $8 million to $9 million. Is that all marketing spend and benefit shift?","Michael G. Koppel","Primarily.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it's not a commission increase. So it is a shift.","Michael G. Koppel","No. No. Good job with the math, Charles.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then I guess my follow-up would be then, therefore, your fourth quarter guidance was for a decrease of, I believe, 45 to 65 basis points on that mid-single digit comp. And I guess if we hit that comp, should we expect the leverage to be greater than that range?","Michael G. Koppel","If we hit a comp greater than what's implied in the guidance?","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Should the decrease in SG&A be greater than 45 to 65 basis points, somewhere in like 65 to 80 basis points because of that shift?","Michael G. Koppel","If our sales performance is better than what we have in the guidance, we should get some leverage.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. What I'm asking, though, is should the leverage be better just because you've got the shift out of fourth quarter and now into the third quarter? Should the decrease be greater?","Michael G. Koppel","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So Mike, maybe back to our earlier conversation in the year when you said you see about $1 billion in investment in e-commerce over the next few years, you're clearly very serious about the business, and that's a big number. Can you tell us maybe just at a high level some of the big ideas for that spending that are starting to bubble up as we get further into the year here?","Michael G. Koppel","Well, I think when we quoted that number, that was roughly the capital plus incremental spend over a 5-year period. So let's just put that number in context. And when you have the kind of scaling that we're seeing in e-commerce, there's a number of things. One is we have to continue and incrementally invest in the technology and the experience on the website. Also, as the business scales, we're going to have to have more fulfillment centers because as we push more product to our supply chain and also our desire to speed up delivery, we want fulfillment closer to our customers. So there's a number of things in there over the long run that are going to require investments, but those are examples of the 2 big ones.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- since we've gone through a lot of the other things in the quarter, just a couple of modeling questions, Mike. First off, the guidance looks like it expects a little bit of a deceleration in the top line or in the same-store sales number. Can you tell us what makes you feel like we should have a decelerating right now? Is it just a matter of being early in the quarter, guys, and let's see how it goes? Or -- and maybe you could tell us between full price and Rack directionally, which one will be higher in the quarter, something like [indiscernible]...","Michael G. Koppel","Well, yes. I don't think it's that specific in terms of full price or Rack. I think it's reflected in our comments and the fact that we've had some impact from Hurricane Sandy. And there's still a level of uncertainty out there in terms of when customer behavior could bounce back to its normal trends. So we're just being cautious.","Operator","Our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk a little bit about -- obviously there was an uptick in regular price sales. How are you -- and that's terrific. How are you managing inventory with that uptick in regular price sales? How's the timing and flow looking for Q4 and how you're thinking about 2013? And does this then for -- portends potentially that margin opportunities for 2013?","Peter E. Nordstrom","Well, this is Pete. I don't know if I can answer that exactly. I will say that our ongoing biggest challenge with inventories is to the extent we've been able to have increases kind of month after month and quarter after quarter, it's difficult to keep a lid on not having inventories grow too fast. Because as you can imagine, a certain amount of optimism tends to build with the buying group. So we are really trying to keep a very conservative plan strategy about how we go forward with our inventories and then that we ensure increasing our turns, which are still pretty high. But that's been the best driver of margin performance for us is to continue to speed up the turns and ensure flow, which is speaking to the issue of customers preferring newness.","Operator","And our final question today is from Richard Jaffe from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. Given the cash balance sort of at near-record levels, where is the right level or where are you most comfortable having your cash balance? And do you think you'll be putting that cash to use to enhance shareholder value? And then just a follow-on about the HauteLook investment. That is to say, could cash be used for another investment? Has HauteLook lived up to expectation at this point?","Michael G. Koppel","Sure. Yes, Richard. This is Mike. We, certainly coming out of the recession of 4 years ago, changed somewhat our point of view, how we felt about liquidity. And we've been maintaining a more conservative liquidity, and that's why you've seen our cash where it is. But at the same time, it's also because we've seen opportunities. And over the last 12 months or so, you've seen our strategy evolve in terms of announcing a variety of ways to grow the business, whether it's through e-commerce or new markets, et cetera. And so number one, we're going to continue to deploy cash into opportunities that we continue to see that are going to enhance shareholder value. And that's the number one thing. In terms of balance, at a little over $1 billion, it might be a little high but it's -- I wouldn't call it materially high from where we want to be. And we'll just keep an eye on it. And clearly, when we see opportunities to repurchase stock, we'll do that in terms of a balanced capital allocation strategy. And you had a question on HauteLook?","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","How is it doing?","Michael G. Koppel","Oh, how's it doing. Sorry about that. HauteLook is doing fine. The business is on track to achieve its sales plan for the year, which is going to be roughly a 50% sales increase. Earnings are a little bit below breakeven, and we continue both with our teams here at Nordstrom and the team at HauteLook, we continue to work together to find new ways that we can enhance all the channels we have available to us to sell product to customers.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is there more synergy between the 3 businesses, the Rack, the full-line stores and e-commerce?","Michael G. Koppel","We are making progress. Thank you.","Robert E. Campbell","Thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available for 1 year on the Investor Relations section of nordstrom.com under Webcasts. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.

Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President; and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's first quarter performance and the outlook for 2018. Joining during the Q&A session will be Erik Nordstrom and Pete Nordstrom, Co-President; and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake Nordstrom","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results reflected our ongoing efforts to integrate our digital and physical assets to serve customers in new and relevant ways.","Our overall sales performance was in-line with our expectations. We delivered total sales growth of 5.8%. This included an increase of around 250 basis points primarily from a loyalty event shift. Comp sales, which are reported on a like-for-like basis, increased 0.6%. The investments we're making in digital continue to pay off. During the quarter, we generated an 18% increase in sales enabled through our digital capabilities compared to the previous year.","Our Full-Price comp sales increase of 0.7% was generally consistent with our trends. Our Off-Price comp sales increase of 0.4%. While we're not satisfied with recent trends in our stores, we're focused on making improvements to our Rack business. On April 12th, we achieved a significant milestone in our company's history with the opening of our first-ever full-line men's store in New York City, located near Columbus Circle. This three-level, 47,000 square-foot store features our latest service experiences to help serve customers on their terms, including express returns kiosks, same-day delivery, 24 by 7 Buy Online & Pick Up in Store, and unique brand partnerships.","Our men's store opened ahead of our New York City flagship which is scheduled for fall of 2019 and we're off to a good start. Manhattan is a premier retail destination and represents our largest online market serving customers. Based on our experience of introducing full-line stores in new markets, we also expect this flagship to deliver a meaningful sales lift in New York City. This quarter marked another important achievement with the introduction of Nordstrom Rack in Canada. Like our experience in the US, we expect synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses. We're seeing terrific results from our three store openings this spring in the Toronto and Calgary markets, with three more openings planned for this fall.","We continue to grow our strategic brand partnerships with a focus on establishing Nordstrom as the partner of choice for brands and providing customers with newness. We want to create a sense of discovery through these collaborations while supporting our regular price selling. Our strategic brands include new and emerging partners along with established ones. During a time of transformation in the industry, we've been investing in digital capabilities to expand our customer reach and engagement. This uniquely positions us to increase market share and drive growth. Our customer-focused approach informs how we allocate capital with the goal of driving customer engagement, market share gains, and improved profitability.","In our top markets, we're further integrating our digital and physical assets across supply chain, technology, marketing, and merchandising to deliver differentiated services and experiences. To lead our efforts, we recently named Ken Worzel as our Chief Digital Officer. As one of our top leaders, Ken is instrumental in driving our digital strategy as we continue to evolve our business. He will also continue in his role as President of Nordstrom.com.","This year we're launching efforts to link our capabilities in our largest market Los Angeles and recently kicked off our efforts with a group of highly engaged customers to co-create unique customer shopping journeys. We intend to apply our learnings from LA to quickly scale to other markets. We continue to see positive trends in customer metrics, which are an important way we measure our progress in gaining new customers and increasing engagement with existing ones. The growth in active customers and customers shopping across multiple channels continues to outpace sales growth, which helps contribute to market share gains.","As we aspire to be the best fashion retailer, our customer strategy is centered on three strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences, and leveraging the strength of our brand. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Anne to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook for the year.","Anne Bramman","Thanks, Blake and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, reporting Q1 EPS of $0.51. From a top line perspective, overall sales were consistent with our expectations and reflected strong digital growth. Additionally, credit revenues came in better than expected, the result of our recent efforts to drive new account growth. In Full-price, our core US business had stabilized trends. Also, Trunk Club showed significant improvement. In Off-price, sales were slightly below our plan, reflecting outsized digital growth offset by Nordstrom Rack stores' performance. As Blake mentioned, we expect improvements throughout the year.","Turning to gross profit, our rate was down approximately 20 basis points relative to last year. This was due to higher occupancy related to US and Canada Rack openings, in addition to planned pre-opening expenses associated with the New York Men's Store. Merchandise margins were in line with expectations and the prior year, reflecting continued strength in regular price selling trends. We exited the quarter in good inventory position, with sales growth exceeding a 2% decline in inventory.","Our SG&A rate was roughly 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to pre-opening expenses for the New York Men's Store. Our SG&A rate performance reflected an improvement relative to recent historical trends as we continue to benefit from productivity gains in marketing, technology, and supply chain.","Next, I'd like to provide further insights on our path forward. As we shared in last quarter's call, we expect 2018 to be an inflection point for improved profitability based on the following drivers: We've made generational investments in Canada and Manhattan and through our acquisitions of HauteLook and Trunk Club. We anticipate operating improvements as these businesses scale.","We're also benefiting from productivity gains as a result of foundational investments in our capabilities. We expect ongoing opportunities for improved expense leverage, particularly in marketing and technology. In supply chain, we continue to invest in creating end-to-end value and improving the customer experience. Our strategic brand partnerships represent another lever that enables us to provide a compelling product offering and strengthen our regular-price selling.","Now I'd like to take a moment to remind you of our capital allocation principles. First and foremost, our priority is to reinvest in the business to create long-term shareholder value. Over the next five years, our CapEx plan of $3.2 billion, or 4% of sales, supports investments in digital capabilities and new market opportunities in Manhattan and Canada. In addition, we seek to return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and resumed share repurchase activity. And finally, we remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating.","Turning now to our full year outlook, we've narrowed the EPS range to $3.35 to $3.55, raising the low end to incorporate our first quarter performance. Our first year sales outlook remains unchanged, reflecting a comp sales increase of 0.5% to 1.5%. Our updated EBIT outlook assumes current revenue trends at a mid-teens growth rate. As a reminder, our outlook includes the following sales timing considerations. While comp sales will be reported on a like-for-like basis, total sales will be impacted by an event shift from the Anniversary Sale.","Additionally, revenue recognition is not expected to materially impact full-year sales, but there will be associated impacts related to the Anniversary event shift. These two combined factors are estimated to create a timing impact to total sales growth by approximately 150 basis points in Q2 and Q3. Please refer to our appendix for further color.","Finally, before we turn to Q&A, we'd like to announce our plans to host an investor event on July 10th. This will give us an opportunity to provide further insights into our customer strategy, how we're positioned for the future, and drivers of long-term value creation. We plan to webcast the event and will follow up with more details.","Now, I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We'll now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] thank you. Our first question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi, great job on the men's store really innovative with the structure and service and curator assortment. Our question is about digitally enabled sales. What's ahead of in terms of improving profitability and margin rates in that overtime? And related to that, is your comments around supply changes. What would you say are the bigger opportunities just making sure that it's seamless as possible in terms of the next chapter of the supply chain? You've been really advance and a lot of the features that you offer such as geolocation and inventory accuracy, would love your thoughts? Thank you.","Erik Nordstrom","Sure. This is Erik. But first on the digitally enabled sales. Our profitability on those sales is really terrific, that's some of our highest profitable customer engagements we have. So our goal is not only are profitable more importantly they are some of our highest satisfaction services we provide. And our focus is to add more customer participating, we have a challenge on awareness. We've a lot of services in our stores and it's not always as conspicuous to customers what those capabilities. It's one of the things we've learned that the local store opening at Los Angeles by having a store that's all about services. It's been easier to communicate to customers what we can do and the engagement with all of those services been terrific. So we're seeing nice growth, [indiscernible] digitally enabled sales and we'll continue to do that.","Supply chain in general, we're looking to leverage the inventory we have to serve customers better. We think it's an advantage that we have a lot of inventory very, very close to our customers which is in stores. Our stores are obviously in the big markets and that happens to be where the vast majority of our online customers are to. So big step in that, will be opening a filled assortment center in Southern California. We're just getting on our way plans on that. but we'll be able to - through that and some other initiatives we're working on, be able to offer our customers much bigger selection at much faster shipping rates and it also leads to pretty significant step in inventory efficiency for us too.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, best regards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager","Could you provide a bit more color on some of the comp results in the off price business. What do you believe drove the softness in the quarter? And did weather play a role at all? And what did you see at the key drivers to the improvement over the remainder of the year that you talked about and especially on the store side? Thank you.","Blake Nordstrom","Mark, it's Blake and I mentioned in the off price comments that we had a 0.4% increase that was just slightly below our plans for our price, but within that we had really strong digital online sales build in Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook but our stores did see some softness in the first quarter and you mentioned whether we did see some seasonally related items and classifications impacted. Predominantly women's apparel, women's is our largest merchandise division in the Rack. There's a number of initiatives that we're working on. I think the thing that we're most encouraged about is that the customer accounts are flat, so we still have a lot of great foot traffic and we have a real opportunity if we get the mix and the buyer right. Our inventories are in line, so we're fluid, we're open to buy and we don't believe we have undue risk with mark downs. So we've been able to address that on a daily basis. Those things that are underperforming and so we fully expect to see improvement throughout this year both in our plans and our expectations and we're working hard on number of initiatives to address those opportunities in Q1.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell","I just want to make sure we walk away understanding the spread between comps and sales with the various shifts. So first I wanted to ask if you could discuss the rewards, loyalty event that shifted into 1Q. And while I understand that helped overall sales by 250 basis points. Could you just clarify whether or not that is included in the comps and then also looking into 2Q? Net sales you mentioned it will be helped by the inclusion Anniversary Sale by 150 basis, but do we net that out against the 250 basis point shift I guess loss from the loyalty event. Help on those items, would be gratefully appreciated.","Anne Bramman","Our 53rd-week year are always challenging no matter what company you talk in the retail space and so let me try and walk you through that, so from a comp perspective we're looking this on a like days for like days. So the shift in calendar has no impact to comp sales. The only delta that we laid out is in the appendix slide of the deck that we went through is on the triple point of that and is net of several things, it's the counter shift, as well as any impact there wasn't a quarter for revenue recognition. So we netted all that together and that part of the spread between comp and total sales growth. When we go to Q2 and Q3 and rest of that schedule we met all of that together for you through - all you have to do is look at all together which we shift in calendar, shifts in events and revenue recognition and that's just the net impact.","Paul Trussell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next is Dana Tulsi [ph] from Tulsi [ph] Advisor Group. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the merchandising side of the business in terms of new products that you put in, new brands that are resonating and how it's differing in Rack versus Fall-line? Thank you.","Pete Nordstrom","Dana, this is Pete. It's been part of our initiative for a while to be fully explicit and purposeful about trying to bring in new brands and that's gone really well. The thing that's probably most encouraging is that we see a growth in strength across our portfolio that's not necessarily because it's new or because it's smaller or because it's exclusive or because it's a large savage [ph] brand. It's kind of how it all works together. So in terms of some of the new things that we've done that have been successful. Like we Allbirds [ph] Sweaty Betty, Phase On, introduced Anthropologie Home, all that's been really great. But at the same time, we're also having really good designer business and established brands that you know. I mean, Gucci, Valentino and St. Laurent are all in top handful of growth brands that we have Chanel is also in there. I mean I think you see a play out when you look at our men's store for example, the kind of unique breadth of offer that we have and we know that's a recipe where it takes a lot of finesse in working on it and the whole brand vendor part of it of all [indiscernible] time, but it's something we spend a lot of time working on and trying to establish collaborative relationship so we're solving for common problems and I think we're really encouraged by where we're with this and what's possible in the future.","Unidentified Analyst","And on the full line stores, is there any categories strength categories that you want to see improve more what we should be looking towards?","Pete Nordstrom","Well I'd say the one that we want to improve more is probably shoes. We had a challenged Q1 in shoes a lot of that was related to some of the seasonal stuff that came up earlier. If you just look at purely like sandal sales as an example, now a lot of that's changed now. The weather is kind of swung across the country little bit back on track. I'd say our women's shoes business if we can get that humming along that would make a big difference. We've had continued strength in the accessories handbag of beauty of our business which just continues to do really well. You heard me mention the designer part, that's the best growing part of our businesses, designer across. The handbag, the women apparel, the men's apparel and shoe offerings and as good that is, I think it suggest it could be better, so we think we can do more that way as well. There's a lot to be encouraged about I think and again we talk about the established brands. You get brands like Lotter [ph] or Nike and people like that, that have been around for long time and we have good strong business with them and good collaborative efforts.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","I guess going back to the digital focus. If you kind of think about furthering that could you just maybe speak to how that's impacting the number of stores you're thinking about on a long-term basis for both Rack and Full-price here in North America? And then at 29% being digitally enhanced where do you see this going overtime?","Erik Nordstrom","Erinn, this is Erik. How we look at it both in Full-price and off-price and I'd say we're little further long in full price we've had stronger data. Is looking at by market and really looking within markets and how can we gain market share by leveraging both our digital assets and our physical assets. And so we continue to get better information all the time of the synergy between the physical and digital. So with that, you've seen a close I don't know two to three stores a year on last couple of years. I think [indiscernible] best barometer going forward. We certainly don't anticipate large scale store closing, all of our stores are profitable both in Rack and our full line stores. So it's more understanding a market where we get the best engagement with customers and how that adds up to be profitable relationship with customer. So our focus is market share by local market and how we can grow that.","Erinn Murphy","And then just maybe on active customers, last quarter you talked about 33 million active customers. I think it's the first time you've given that metric, any update to where that was at the end of the first quarter?","Anne Bramman","Yes, so I don't think it's materially changed in our plans, we try to give some color commentary in the [indiscernible] as far as how [indiscernible] the customer. I think that's more of a metric that you'd want to look to on a rolling 12-month basis.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Question at your full-price doors, same store sales decelerated from a 2.4 comp in the fourth quarter to a 0.7 comp this quarter comparison with similar. I know you said sales hate [ph] your plan and you spoke to signs of stabilization. But I guess what do you think accounts for the sequential flowing at full price, despite what a lot of companies are speaking towards a pretty strong consumer backdrop for your core customers. Just and maybe Blake any thoughts that you have for that sequential flow.","Anne Bramman","Yes, so I think a couple of things that before we talk about the overall. I just want to get anchored in some of the numbers. So the first thing is when we talk about full price that includes stores, our digital channels as well as Canada and Trunk Club in it. So that is all in full price so that's not necessarily a same store sales as we mentioned last quarter. It's really gotten very muddy and it's really gotten it's not even how we look at it inside the business as well. so it's we're really looking at this less on a less channel basis and more on a comp and total sales based on full price and soft price. So that's number one so when you look at the release that we get, it actually showed that on a comparable basis, we went in and revised to see if you could see the overall trends in that full price business. so we actually thought in Q1 against Q1 of last year was actually was a positive comp versus last year the negative comp. so we feel like in Q1, our full price business has continued trend particularly what we thought in the second half of last year.","Matthew Boss","Great. And so that your 7% comp that you did this quarter, what comp did you in the fourth quarter on apples-to-apples basis?","Anne Bramman","2.4%.","Matthew Boss","Right, so what accounts for that sequential deceleration from the 2.4 to 0.7 that was really the basis of the question?","Jamie Nordstrom","This is Jamie. I think one of the things that we saw coming into in the Q1, was a little bit of - its slight deceleration early in the quarter on some of our online traffic mostly is results of some changes we made with marketing, with so much product or execution. Those trends started to shift towards the end of the quarter. So while you're right, it does show a deceleration. I think there's puts and takes in Q4. We feel pretty good about how we came out of Q1, overall if you look at our business our full price business over the last year over the two years, it's been incredibly stable and in terms of traffic and ticket and average point all those metrics. So it's really nothing to point to that would give you any color.","Matthew Boss","That's the one.","Operator","Next is Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom","Anne back in March you gave us some color on the margin cadence as 2018 progressed. I think you said it's not in the slide deck this afternoon, so just want to ask and see if you could clarify. I think you said the first quarter would be below, second quarter be above and then the back half would be in line, operating margins were down about 45 basis points here in 1Q, just want to see if you still believe in the cadence throughout the rest of the year.","Anne Bramman","So directionally, we gave you that's the right cadence. Clearly there's going to be a little bit here and there, but when we look at the margins for Q1 it was pretty in line with our expectations. So we still - and so the guidance we gave for the ups and downs as well as the full year was [indiscernible] it's pretty correct.","Chuck Grom","Okay and then just looking ahead on Slide 11, you talked about the planned improvement. It's the second time you've shown that slide just curious where you think and you look out over the next couple of years operating margins could get to and I guess embedded in that, what would be the comp that you will need to get there and what would be the leverage hurdle?","Anne Bramman","I'm sorry so you're talking about the generational investments?","Chuck Grom","Yes, on Slide 11 we talked about the planned improvement over the next four to five years.","Anne Bramman","So as we've been talking about, we've been making investments along the way. And we've had - we're opening the stores in Canada with Rack which we're seeing is really enhancing our penetration strategy and customer awareness in the Canadian market and to that, it's a big piece of it. And the other big piece that's coming online is the New York Tower in fall of next year. So as that comes online that's really going to help the margin improvement. And then we're continuing to see as our digital growth and we talked about this both in the off price and full price business and so we highlighted the fact that Trunk Club's improved and we've also highlighted the fact that we had outsized digital growth and our online business for the off price.","Chuck Grom","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next is Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","To follow-up on earlier question. Just recognizing the puts and takes of the new comp methodology and I guess that the 53-week of sort of have [indiscernible], so any help you could give us with extracations [ph] for you 2Q comps. And why figure is not for compare and I'm sorry if I missed it. The tax rate what's the right way to think about when does that start to come down, thanks.","Anne Bramman","Yes, so we don't normally give guidance on first comps on a quarterly basis and so we'll be looked at, we delivered comps points 6 for Q1 and we still have reaffirmed our guidance for the total year and so again we're looking at comps as a light [indiscernible] like day versus and so we gave you guidance on the shift in account for total sales versus comp. the way I would think about the tax rate it is, we still are also are disappointed, the rate that we gave at the beginning of the year for guidance but there's just some timing shift between recognizing profitability within Canada and the US, so it's going to be little choppy throughout the year but for the full year it should wind to what we gave you.","Simeon Siegel","All right thanks. Best of the luck for the year.","Operator","Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","I wanted to just follow-up on Erinn's question about the optimal store count. Knowing that you're looking at your store count on a market-by-market basis. After you've gone through that analysis and sort of aggregated it out, what numbers are you coming up with in terms of an ideal US store fleet both for Rack and for Full-price? And then I just wanted to ask, it sounded like the slight miss to plan in the off-price business came from the women's apparel business, do you attribute that just to weather? Do you think there were any execution issues and was that the only business that missed the plan? Thanks so much.","Jamie Nordstrom","Kimberly, this is Jamie. I'll take the first part and hand it over to Blake. In terms of store count we're really not looking at tops down number. I'd reiterate what Erik mentioned earlier, we're looking at market-by-market and we've had more matured markets we happen to gone from Los Angeles right now where we've been doing business for 40 years. Some of these stores we opened in centers that were once better than they're now and we've got some stores that in centers that are doing better than ever. And so there's a lot that goes into how we look at it. It's by investing in existing stores. We have number of stores that we've made big investments end of last few years and have plans to continue to invest in our best stores. In addition to that, we have a store that might be the fifth or sixth store in a market that we opened when that made all more sense. I think 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago and you've seen us closed some of those stores. So it's a combination of investing in our best stores, calling those stores that are involved that are not as relevant anymore, but overall looking at it market-by-market and seeing how we can be as effective as possible in serving our customers there.","Blake Nordstrom","So Kimberly this is Blake. In terms of the Rack or Off-price we have roughly 240 stores. These are very productive stores and we're very pleased to have a very robust online business as well. It was just shy of $1 billion last year. So we're in earlier days of trying to understand as Erik talked about earlier in and Jamie about looking it from a customers' point of view and how we can best serve them both in physical bricks and mortar and also digitally. So we're strategic and opportunistic in terms of new store growth, we don't have a set number. Again we're about 240, we're opening six in Canada this year. We have six stores in the US in relocation. We've four slated for 2019. So it's not a set number. It has to meet our criteria, these are all strong stores so we're not looking to close stores in that. But we do think in general, that we have a very strong base, with that strong digital base to best serve the customer.","Your second question was regarding women's and you asked about the weather or the seasonal part, that I mentioned and were there any other execution issue, yes there was. But I think the most material was some bets that we made in some areas that were more seasonally related that in Q1 at least didn't play out as well, the customer voted. Your other question was, were there any other businesses or merchandise area within the Rack that misplanned [ph]. No I would say predominantly the other merchandise areas met or slightly exceeded their plans again since women's is such large part of the business. It had an impact on it, but across the board we see lots of opportunities and that what we're getting after. We have a number of tests that we're working on right now. This is a business that's pretty nimble and agile and so we can take those learnings in the feedback we get from our people and the customer, apply it and literally within 30 days get some feedback and made some adjustments. And the fact that our inventories are in line is a real strength for us.","Kimberly Greenberger","Super helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Nest is Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Tunick","Question on the outside growth you're seeing in digital, is that fulfilment and shipping etc., is that still having a negative impact on margins or have you reach scale? I just haven't heard you guys talk about that being a determent right now and then secondly off the $3.2 billion in your CapEx plans you're talking about, what is being assumed for DC's and supply chain versus other investments? Thank you very much.","Erik Nordstrom","Brian, this is Erik. I'll take the first part. Our growth in digital [indiscernible]. Really what's the question?","Unidentified Company Representative","Fulfilment.","Erik Nordstrom","Sorry about that. As you've heard us talk about we look at our business as full price and off price, the customer journey is very much digital and physical combined and the impact of additional goes way beyond what's captured in e-commerce sales. That being said, when we do break it out as best we can and it's hard to get precise because there's so much overlap. We break it out for full price, our e-commerce profit margin about the exactly same as our store profit margins. So we don't experience any movement in our operating margins when there's a shift from physical to digital. Anne [indiscernible]?","Anne Bramman","CapEx and [indiscernible] I think it's provided in the Q4 or the last quarter earnings, that was just a highlight. Between fulfilment was roughly about 20% of our CapEx spend and if you look at technology and fulfilment combined, it was almost half.","Brian Tunick","That's very helpful. See you on July 10. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Just curious if there was a gross margin impact of the shift on the loyalty event this quarter and what might the impact in 2Q? And just curious higher level, how you might characterize the promotional environment out there today relative to recent quarters. Thanks.","Anne Bramman","So I'll take the gross margin question. There we really aren't seeing a shift in the margin component to it and so Pete, do you want to take the promotional environment.","Pete Nordstrom","Yes, there's really kind of no news in the promotional environment it's pretty stable, in some ways the things that we've done has mitigated that, given the kind of preferred brands, strategic approach that we're taking in lot of brands, lot of that's in response to trying to offset some of the promotional activity, but by in large if you look at it, it's pretty flat. Consistent.","Paul Lejuez","Okay and was there any sort of pressure for the size of below plans sales at Rack. Did you have to promote more heavily there to move through the - to quantify in 1Q on the gross margin line.","Pete Nordstrom","I don't know if there is anything that would call out, there are classifications whether we've got a glut in the inventory, the customer is not responding because it's kind of isolated case would be like dresses. So we've got a lot of dresses and they're backing up and so we might take additional mark downs at selected times to move a classification. But it doesn't move the needle for the total gross margins and it's not apples and oranges what we've done in previous years. So we think we're able to address those slow sellers and maintain our margins.","Anne Bramman","And I would just say, that calls out in the comments that our gross margin is pretty consistent with what we were expecting in year over year as well.","Paul Lejuez","Okay and do you expect any pressure in the second quarter as a result of that, the dresses glut, in face to be called out.","Pete Nordstrom","No I think we're pleased about it, we're trying in more real time address any slow sellers we have and we feel very good about how current our inventories and the risk or exposure to it. And I think that's why Anne and the team felt confident with our full year guidance.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Thank you. Good luck guys.","Operator","Next is Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","I just want to be crystal clear and I know you won't help us with the second quarter comp, you gave us the year. But is your view that to build our comps from here we start with the momentum in first quarter which in your mind is the underlying momentum if you ignore these shifts at the 0.6 and that's not effected by loyalty and that doesn't come out of 2Q, so you roll that momentum forward and then incorporate some sort of acceleration that Jamie spoke to earlier with some of the digital headwinds early in the quarter blowing off by the end of the quarter, is that the way that we should be rolling forward as we think about the near term underlying momentum of the business?","Anne Bramman","Yes, I think that's pretty fair. I guess I'll say when we gave the comp guidance 0.5 to 1.5 it was based on what we were seeing a pretty consistent trend. We would expect on the high end of our guidance on the comps that we're going to see continued in our off price business as well as continue to accelerated growth in digital. You have to contemplate that on the high end, on the low end of the comp pricing. Which you would assume is the change in off price in particular in the Rack stores really doesn't change that much for the year. So on this comp, the bellwether [ph I would use when you look at the rest of the year.","Michael Binetti","Okay and then, just a couple on the margin, really quickly here. I think you gave some commentary last quarter that first quarter EBITDA will be down and that came through. Second quarter EBITDA was to be up. Third and fourth quarter to be flat and then can you help us, anchor ourselves on the gross margin impact of the Anniversary sale moving in the second quarter. Can we use the historical analogies of 2016 shift for how much of the gross margin moves because of the sale?","Anne Bramman","Wow! That's pretty granular.","Michael Binetti","There's lot going on here.","Anne Bramman","Yes, there's a lot going on there. So I think again I would encourage you take a look at comps and build from there on some of the accounts that are shipped then you get the totals of, I think once you guys do that and you look at our historical patterns around things like Anniversary sale. I think you can massage it with the margin structure would look like in the EBIT pieces to it.","Blake Nordstrom","A minutia, if there's a margin issue related to the sale that for the sale because we not sold through well and then that result in mark downs count down the road. So it really doesn't happen in the moment so much.","Michael Binetti","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Next is Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Just wanted to follow-up on the comment, that Trunk Club made significant improvements in the quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about why and what your expectations are for that business this year?","Erik Nordstrom","Sure, it's Erik. It's pretty time last year, we really spent - the team spent all of last year doing a pretty deep dive and change the typical business model, mainly around the Trunk business. We do have the Clubhouses, the majority of the business is through the Trunk's. So we pulled back on marking last year to get the business model to point where we think we can scale it, we think we're to that point right now, over the last several months. In particular, I think everything we do, it's about serving customers better and our customer's response has been significant more positive. In particular it shows up and the keep rates we have from the Trunk's we have sent out and the number of repeat Trunk's that customers are signing up for both of those metrics are significantly improved from what we've had since we bought the business. so I would describe it as still early days, but we're certainly encouraged that the core of the business, the Trunk business has a model that is something we're excited about, we're confident that success can continue and something we can get behind and start to leverage more.","Trina Schurman","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brian Cowen [ph] with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Anne, on an ongoing basis you continue to run at the high end of your 1.5 to 2.5 times long-term leverage range and I appreciate the comments on IG ratings. I guess I'm wondering has the targeted changed and then can you discuss your willingness to sort of flex the balance sheet for additional investment if you find it share repurchase, M&A or sort of where you'll be comfortable operating from a credit rating perspective, if you find a unique opportunity. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes so on the flex side we're at the top end right now, we've had as you know from the pre-opening expenses and some of the investments in Manhattan and Canada and this comp [ph] tripping up to the higher end of the leverage range. We still don't feel very comfortable with that leverage range, I mentioned in the comment. We're committed to being a strong investment grade debt company and so you know as we start bringing some of the generational investments more in line, some more growth we expect to see that leverage to get back into the norm. As far as the flex on the balance sheet, I think we'll have a lot more opportunities to provide some color in the Analyst Day on that as well. but in general, we have a fairly conservative balance sheet, we do want to be investment grade and we do take a look at where is the best return on our investment, to first investing in the company and driving shareholder value that way and then looking at the best way to return cash to shareholders with dividends or share buyback. We do take a look at share buyback as a return metric and we're little opportunistic as we see the price in mitigating our balance, where we think intrinsic value is that the company be opportunistic in that manner. From an M&A perspective, again we've got a very flexible balance sheet. So again we're looking at what's the best right investments and long-term return for the shareholders.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for all that detail. Appreciated.","Trina Schurman","Again, thank you for joining today's call. A replay along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks will be available for one-year on our website.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will begin with prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom's. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include 30 minutes for your questions.","Before we begin, I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to Nordstrom.com, in the Investor Relations section. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President, and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's first quarter performance and the outlook for fiscal year 2016. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete and Erik Nordstrom, Co-Presidents, and Jamie Nordstrom, President of Stores.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Thank you, and good afternoon. For the first quarter, we had a sales increase of 2.5% and a comp decrease of 1.7%, which fell short of our plan for a low-single-digit increase. Despite our focused efforts to manage through this current environment, we are not satisfied with our results. Given these sales trends, our inventories were too high, which puts pressure on our margins and necessitates additional markdowns. Our team has aggressively addressed our inventory position, and as a result, we ended the quarter with inventory up 5% versus sales growth of 2%. For the balance of the year, our lowered inventory plans puts us in a much stronger position to manage the business more proactively.","In addition to our inventory management efforts, we're continuing to evolve our operating model to support our growth strategy. On April 18, we announced expense reduction efforts, predominantly here in our Seattle headquarters, of $60 million. This includes elimination of approximately 400 roles, which is about 7% of our corporate positions. This will improve our focus and execution and make us more nimble to respond to the business environment. Later, Mike will share more on our expense reduction efforts.","As we look at the balance of the year, we are actively implementing a number of initiatives to drive top-line growth and improve the customer experience. On May 18, we're rolling out an expanded Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program that will allow all of our customers to earn rewards with or without a Nordstrom card. Our Rewards customers are many of our most loyal and best customers, spending four times more annually. Today, only about one out of five customers are part of our program, yet their spend contributes roughly 40% of our sales. This opportunity to reward all of our customers is big. Over the next 12 months, our goal is to add 5 million customers to our program. This will drive more sales and trips, and more importantly, it will enable us to better engage with our customers.","On the technology and e-commerce side, we are investing to create a more seamless experience across stores and online. This reflects continued modernization of our technology platform, including a scalable merchandising solution as well as service and experience features. These are significant projects. They account for two-thirds of our overall technology investments this year.","We're building on the continued success of our Canada expansion with two full-line store openings in Toronto this fall. With Toronto representing the most productive market in Canada and one of the top markets in all of North America, we see this as a significant opportunity. We believe these stores have the potential, along with our international flagship in Vancouver, B.C., to be among our highest volume stores.","In the U.S., we plan to open our second full-line store in Austin, Texas, which is a dynamic and growing market. Our strategy remains squarely focused on serving customers on their terms. Knowing customers' desire and experience is both personalized and convenient, we are making improvements to enable our customers to shop seamlessly any way they choose. In our stores, our overall focus is to improve convenience. As a recent example, we enhanced the buy online, pickup in store experience by providing curbside pickup in all of our full-line stores. Additionally, we are upgrading our scheduling tool to support our team's efforts to ensure we have the right people in the right place at the right time. This will help improve customer service and productivity.","On the merchandising side, we are dedicated to having the brands customers want, with a keen eye towards product differentiation. We know customers desire newness in fashion but are being more deliberate with their purchases. We are seeing great results from our recent collaborations, such as IVY PARK, Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville, and Charlotte Tilbury. We will continue to introduce and grow relevant brands that are compelling to our customers while having limited distribution.","Moving to off-price, Nordstrom Rack represents an important channel for us to serve more customers and increase cross-shopping. Last year, 5 million new customers shopped at the Rack. This is meaningful because over one-third of our Rack customers will over time also shop in our full-price business. We've been pleased with our six stores that have opened so far this year. Their sales exceeded our expectations by more than 10%. We plan to open 15 more new stores this fall.","In closing, we recognize that the pace of change is increasing, so we're working diligently to evolve our business to best serve our customers. This means continuing to make the tough but necessary decisions that will ensure we are set up for continued success. We are confident that through our initiatives, we are competitively positioned to deliver the products and experiences our customers want.","I'll now turn it over to Mike who will provide more color on our performance along with details on the changes we are making to our business.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Blake. As we head into the balance of the year, we expect that uncertainty in sales trends will continue and have built that into our outlook. We are implementing comprehensive plans to ensure that we can execute levers around inventory, expense, and capital, all while maintaining our strong financial position. These plans also incorporate our commitment to liquidity and working capital needs by optimizing our inventory turns. We are aggressively prioritizing our resources to assure that every dollar spent is meaningful to the customer experience, and we'll continue to challenge activities that are not.","Now I'll provide additional color on our first quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.26 were below our expectations, primarily due to lower sales volume and higher markdowns as we align inventory to current sales trends. Our results also included credit charge-backs and severance charges of $0.10. These charge-backs, which were significantly higher than planned, related to an industry change in liability rules that took effect last October. In early February, we completed the rollout of our chip-enabled point-of-sale system. As a result, we have begun to see these charge-backs decrease and anticipate a smaller residual impact in the second quarter.","Moving to the top-line, we had a comp decrease of 1.7% and total sales increase of 2.5%. Our full-price businesses, which include our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Trunk Club, and Canada, had a comp decrease of 4.3%. This softness was broad-based across stores and online as well as across merchandise categories, although we had notably tougher trends in jewelry and handbags as well as some of our larger volume brands. On a positive note, we continue to see customers desiring fashion and newness, reflected in consistent regular price selling as well as strength in our new and emerging brands. Our off-price business, including stores and online, had a comp increase of 4.6%.","In addition to inventory management, expense rigor is a key component of our plan. We are making strategic decisions to invest in our future growth while focusing on areas where we can further streamline. We continue to move forward with our emphasis on technology as a top priority, committing one-third of our capital investments. In March, after considerable planning, we implemented a new technology operating model which included adding technical expertise at the senior management level. We are confident that these improvements will lead Nordstrom's next phase of growth and innovation while continuing to optimize productivity and reduce complexity.","We are also executing on a number of initiatives to increase efficiencies across our supply chain and marketing functions. In our supply chain, we have an ongoing opportunity to improve the unit economics of product delivered to customers. We are refining our online assortment through greater focus on key brands and categories while editing less profitable items. We're also improving our merchandise allocation process between stores and fulfillment centers, leading to a reduction in split shipments, lower cancellation rates, and better in-stock positions, all of which ultimately improve our customer experience.","Similar to our efforts with technology, we are taking steps to increase marketing effectiveness across our enterprise. All of these changes are part of the broader ongoing efforts in improving our operating model. Through our actions, we expect to generate this year over $150 million in expense savings inclusive of $60 million from our corporate realignment efforts. We continue to explore further opportunities to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in business conditions and customer expectations.","Our third lever in addition to inventory and expense discipline relates to capital deployment and allocation. Given the changes we are seeing in our industry, we are in the final stages of a thorough review of our five-year capital plan. This includes prioritizing our investments to achieve our stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. We will provide updates on these plans once they are finalized.","Now, I'd like to address our financial outlook. In updating our plans for the remainder of the year, we feel it is appropriate to realign our outlook given the uncertainty in trends and expectations for a continued promotional environment. Comp sales are expected to be between a 1% decrease to a 1% increase compared with our prior outlook of flat to a 2% increase. Our earnings per diluted share expectation for this year is $2.50 to $2.70 compared with our prior outlook of $3.10 to $3.35.","In closing, while the pace of change continues to accelerate, our commitment to serving our customers remains unchanged. With our experienced leadership team, we are confident in our ability to manage through this current cycle. We maintain a healthy balance sheet and cash flow that will support the best interest of our customers, employees, and shareholders over the long-term.","Now, I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. We will now move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Mike, I'm wondering if \u2013 as you're reevaluating your financial targets here for 2016, if you have taken another look at your five-year capital plan to see if there might be an opportunity perhaps to cut back or redeploy some capital that you had previously targeted for that five-year plan. Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Kim. Yeah, thank you for your question. I did mention in our comments that we are going through a thorough review of the capital plan which will result in a reduction of that plan. We haven't articulated that specifically yet. We're reviewing it with our board next week. And after we complete that discussion, we're happy to share it.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Totally understood. Are there any sort of overarching strategies or any new insights that you're bringing to bear as you go through those discussions that might just sort of help us understand how you are evaluating your capital opportunities?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think, clearly, as we've been talking for the last couple of years, we're seeing a transformation in our business model. The e-commerce element continues to grow at a good pace and the impact of technology in digital on the customer experience continues to accelerate. So that would imply our commitment to technology and fulfillment and the things that continue to support that business is going to be something we're going to stay very strong on. On the other side, we continue to see traffic falling off in malls. And how we think about our store-based asset will probably require some level of adjustment. So I think fundamentally that's how we're thinking.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. So I just wanted to hear your thoughts on the roughly 10-point spread this quarter between Rack and full-line comps. What do you think off-price is delivering that full-price department stores just seem to be missing? And as we think about the lower run-rate at Nordstrom.com this quarter, how do you accelerate traffic online, and anything to account for the moderation that we saw over the last three months?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Matt, this is Blake. I'll take the first part of that. I think, first of all, we would emphasize the online off-price part of that business, which comprises of HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com. And that's a newer business for us. It's been on a pretty steep curve. We have a much more mature business on the full-price side of it, and so that's been contributing greatly.","And then the Rack has had a pretty consistent performance for some time. It, along with our other businesses, saw a little bit of softening in Q3 and Q4. And we were pleased in the Rack stores to see it get closer to trend in Q1. So the off-price business is more about a consistency with our trends and our plans. And there are some challenges and some headwinds in the full-price business that, I think, Erik can add a little bit to.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","Yeah, I can give you some context on the drop-off in our Nordstrom.com business. Two categories I'd want to share with you.","Number one, if you're looking at customer behavior, our conversion is up, our customer acquisition, retention, AUR are all pretty much in line with our budget. Where we saw drop-off was on trips. We had fewer trips come into our website last quarter. The second category that sheds some light in looking at regular versus off-price business on our Nordstrom.com site. Our regular price demand is up in the mid-double-digits and has remained healthy for quite some time.","Where we're seeing a big miss is in our clearance and promo \u2013 promotional business. So what we take away from that is, number one, the clearance and promotional environment is really noisy. There's a lot of excess product out in the marketplace. It's certainly easy to shop online. There's some heavy, heavy discounting going on. And we're seeing that effect in our business.","Secondly, the customers are coming to us for newness and a great experience. And that portion of our business remains pretty darn healthy. So that \u2013 looking forward, what gives us confidence and what we're determined to stay focused on is giving customers great merchandise, a reason to come and buy something new, and give them a great experience.","And I think it was in Blake's comments earlier, mentioned some of the brands that we're doing well with. That's more of what we see in our future, something like IVY PARK that we launched, a very limited distribution brand. We had great performance on that online and in our stores. The experience online was something we're pretty proud of and was a differentiated experience. And where we saw a lot of weakness, it was in some very highly promotional brands that we had tough results with this quarter. So that's what we're seeing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Co.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. I wanted your thoughts on what's happening regarding the price matching in the marketplace. You've done a great job really responding to the kind of preferences consumers have around that. And also your comments on editing less profitable items: could you just elaborate a little bit on the direction strategically, what that implies and if it's related to what you mentioned about larger volume brands being a little tougher? Just curious about what that means for strategy, those pieces. Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Co-President and Director","Okay. This is Erik. On price matching, it's \u2013 the cause and effect is a little clearer online in our stores, the price transparency that the Internet provides. And we have been more purposeful for, I'd say, the last couple years of matching price on products online, really for big online retailers, wherever they may be because there is no regionality to e-commerce. And that has served us well in gaining trust with the customers. We do not look to price matching or price promotion in any way as being a big strategic lever and a way of driving our top line. We look at price matching as a customer respect and a customer trust issue; that when a customer comes to us, they know that they're being treated fairly. And we think the clearest way of doing that and what customers expect is to not pay more for a specific item when they're shopping with us.","So that's served us well in establishing that trust. We know from hearing our customers that they do have more confidence in our pricing than even just a couple of years ago. But strategically, where we're looking to win long-term is \u2013 at full-price, is with newness which, as I mentioned, I think is increasingly with more limited distributed brands that really excite the fashion customer and gets them to look for something new.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oliver, the second part of your question on the unit profitability. There's a couple of elements of that. One is just our \u2013 better understanding the breadth of our assortment. One of the ways that we've been able to expand and grow our online business is through expanding the assortment and, at the same time, we also found that through expansion, some of our price points got to some lower levels; that it becomes more difficult to make money on. So we're evaluating that. We've also done a lot of work to eliminate split shipments. Clearly, if you have to pay a delivery charge on a split shipment, it cost you more than if it goes in one shipment. So as we've grown and learned more about this business, we're finding ways to be more diligent and specific about understanding those levers and making some progress on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Just wondered if you could talk a little bit about some of the other strengths or maybe weaknesses in the assortment and some of the things that you're doing to continue to bring that newness to the customer, whether it be through expanding Madewell, bringing in IVY PARK or also, you've had so much success with Nordstrom Product Group product recently. I just wondered if you could maybe speak to the changes that you're making to the assortment to continue to excite the customer. Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","This is Pete. You answered that question well, actually. Those are all things that we're doing. So, yeah, I think the thing that should be kind of hopeful and promising to all is we still have good examples of product that comes in and performs exceedingly well. It's not like there's a malaise over everything no matter what. It's just that's not the case. We've had good success, as we've talked about, with Topshop that continues on. Brandy Melville's been really good, Madewell, Charlotte Tilbury, IVY PARK. Anywhere where we can work with the brands and to do something not necessarily entirely exclusive but somewhat limited to our stores around a brand that a customer has confidence in and interest in. That's a great formula for us.","So the thing that we have going for us is we've had some success with these things. There are people in the industry that are interested in working with us. And we're big enough where we can create some special programs that it can be really compelling to a vendor. So we've found that most of our talks with the brands and the vendors have been positive about the things that we can work on together to help us stimulate interest with the customer. So we continue on with that journey. We're going to be pragmatic and conservative with our plans, but we're going to be aggressive about trying to figure out new ways to get customers excited.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Does that mean that you pull back on some maybe bigger brands that are very heavily promoted in order to kind of get out of that whole frenzy?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yeah, well, it was alluded to in what Mike and Erik talked about. There's some businesses that we've been in, whether it's a specific item or brand, that might be pretty good to the top-line, but over time, it may not be particularly good for the bottom-line. So we've got to reconcile those issues. And there \u2013 you heard us mention, there's some big brands that we have that have had some precipitous declines. A lot of that's related to promotion and how that's adversely impacted that brand with our customers.","So, yeah, I mean, the good news is, is if you're a buyer here at Nordstrom, that creates some open-to-buy. It creates an opportunity to try some new vendors, some new programs, some new things. And so, brands are an important part of what we do, but if they're offering, and the way things are going with certain brands, are damaging to our brand, then, obviously, we've got to figure out alternatives and different things to try. And so that's part of it. You heard about these brands, and you mentioned our own label product, the Nordstrom Product Group, which has been really pretty strong for us relatively as well. So we will continue on that path.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon. I guess just as one quick follow-up to Oliver's question, are you seeing any change in the percentage of transactions that are actually price matched in-store?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a good question. Jamie, do you know that?","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","I don't know if we know that exact number at the moment.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So maybe if I can sneak another one in there...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll have to (26:13) Yeah, Steve. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry, Steve. No, we didn't have the exact answer for you, but we can get back to you on that one.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sounds good. So I guess you also mentioned the more promotional environment. How much of that is being driven by kind of the traditional competitors, the traditional promotional cadence, versus either brands now trying to go direct or even e-commerce? And are there any kind of mitigating factors you have from brands going direct? Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yeah, this is Pete. It's both. It's the traditional competitors, and it's the fact that all these brands are retailers as well. Everyone finds themselves in a tough environment, and they're doing what they can to stimulate sales. And I think it just depends on your customer. For some, I guess that means price promotion is a lever that's going to really compel their customers. I think what you're hearing from us is that's not the most compelling lever for our customers. So what can we do about that?","Again, I think we're big enough where we matter to brands, and so we can have conversations about how to run a healthy business and the choices that we have. The other thing that we have going for us is brands like our customers. We've got a lot of the kinds of customers that they want to appeal to, and we have good customer data, and we can be transparent about that with our brand partners, we can usually work towards solutions that are going to work well. So I \u2013 we've got a lot of things going for us that I think put us in a position where we can do something about this.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Mike. Could you just dig into the margins a bit more for us? Just given the current inventory levels, what kind of assumptions are you \u2013 or we should be making regarding continued merchandise margin pressure into the second quarter? Also, how should we think about the Anniversary Sales shift impact to 2Q and 3Q? And then moving towards SG&A, what are the adjustments \u2013 given the adjustments that you're making, how should we think about the cadence of expenses? It certainly seems like it was still at an elevated level here this quarter.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well, Paul, thanks for your questions there. Starting with the margin pressure, I mean, clearly, we haven't specifically broken out those line items, but based on the fact that we are in what is a typical down-cycle where demand is soft, we're going to keep the pressure on ensuring that our inventories are turning, they're turning healthy, we maintain liquidity, and we continue to bring new goods in. So that will pressure margins. And we have made assumptions within our outlook that include that.","As far as the A Sale impact, the impact to the EPS is probably a couple cents shift between the second quarter and third quarter and about a 200 basis point shift out of Q2 into Q3 for comps. And just so everybody understands that, every several years our Anniversary Sale, the last week of that falls into the third quarter. This is a year where that happens. So you're going to see the shift that relates to that.","In terms of SG&A, again, we haven't broken that out by quarter or specifically by line item. But I will say that we've already begun to see the impacts of the things that we are talking about. We expect the impacts of those elements to continue to improve as the year progresses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. How much of the...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Lorraine.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hi. How much of the product in the store would you say is limited or exclusive to you? And how big do you think that could get over time, if that'll be the key differentiating factor for the stores? How much of the store do you think you could get that to?","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Yeah, it's limited. It's a range. So I would say in terms of stuff that's relatively limited or completely exclusive, it's probably maybe a third of our offer. Maybe a little bit more, it's hard to say. The thing is we're still a house of brands and one of the strongest elements that we have to compel ourselves to customers is the breadth of what we have to offer, and brands really lead the way for that. So I think it's important that we don't manage with a blunt instrument. It takes a lot of finesse. And I think it's important that we're always out there in the market looking to buy the best of what the market has to offer. And then we can kind of work as time goes on on how to be meaningful enough to that brand where we can have a collaborative thing that works well for both of us.","So we're pretty open, but again, ultimately, we want to make sure we're doing business we think could be profitable over time. So we can work on that more and it's become more and more of an important issue as time's gone on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Neely.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. So if we looked at your 2016 Triple Points Event as kind of a proxy for your most loyal customers and their behavior, are you seeing more stability in the top-line performance on those kind of days, Triple Points versus what you just reported so far this spring? And maybe is it the lulls kind of in between the events that are causing more of the comps decline? We're just trying to get a sense of your truly most loyal customers and how they're feeling and how they're behaving. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Neely. This is Mike. Thanks your question. We still see the penetration from our Nordstrom Rewards customers at roughly the same level, a little better than it was last year. In terms of the events, I wouldn't say that there is a material change in how we're seeing event versus non-event periods. I will say that our last Triple Event, the timing of it probably wasn't the best, and so we're making adjustments for that.","We're super-excited about the non-tender. There's a couple elements about the non-tender program I think that give us a lot to look forward. One is, as Blake mentioned, there's an opportunity to engage in a whole another pool of customers and to bring them into our loyalty program. And we have seen over time a multiple increase in spend, roughly four times spend and three times more trips of those that are engaged in our loyalty program.","And the other element of it was I think more on an operational side, and that is we really learned a lot about how to develop a good customer experience. As a matter of fact, an outstanding customer experience as we went through the development of this tool. And so, we're really excited about that. We're looking forward to our customers using it. We believe it's very simple to sign up and simple to use and will further engage a lot more folks into our Rewards program.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Nice sequential improvement in the Rack comp. Can you talk more about the drivers there? Just curious to what extent did higher inventory transfers from full-price perhaps boost conversion or UPT in Rack? And to the extent that you're able to reduce full-price receipts given the softer sales environment, would that be a potential headwind on the Rack store comp as you progress through the year?","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","Mark, this is Blake. It's hard to point to one thing that was material enough that moved those sales. As I mentioned earlier, we're working on a number of issues. We did see, overall, an improvement. Part of the Rack's mix is the full-line store transfer merchandise you talked about. And that's up slightly because as we get this clearance rises, markdowns rise, and we're getting almost kind of clearance fatigue for some of the customers that are not as motivated on this merchandise, it's causing us to have to take markdowns sooner and steeper in some cases to clear it. That's moved up a little bit at the Rack.","The Rack has a balance of closeouts from our top vendors along with this full-line store merchandise. Again, we're just pleased overall that it improved. We think we are taking the necessary steps with our inventory planning within the off-price division to be fluid for what's available in the market because there's more product out there in both to ensure that we're in a position to open-to-buy and flexibility for what comes our way from our full-price channels both in dot-com and full-line stores.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Just a couple ones real quick. First of all, wondering if you can tell us what the comp store sales were for the brick-and-mortar stores only for full-price, off-price. And secondly, since you entered Canada, we've seen some changes up there in terms of the economic outlook with lower oil prices, higher unemployment, and now there's some discussion about a housing bubble in Canada. Any concerns about how that might affect your expansion plans and the performance of the stores you've opened so far up in Canada? Thank you.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","This is Jamie. I'll start with the Canada question. Our entry into Canada has gone really well. We are now a year and a half into \u2013 since we opened in Calgary. We opened our first international flagship in Vancouver last fall. We're also in Ottawa. And, as Blake mentioned, we're excited about the two stores we're opening in Toronto this fall. Yeah, there's been a lot of talk about different macroeconomic issues in Canada. I will tell you we've not seen a material impact from those, particularly in Calgary, which has a big concentration around the energy industry. We may have seen a couple of slight impacts, but overall, our business there remains strong.","And we're really encouraged by the overall customer reception we've had to our stores and on our merchandise mix and our service. And so despite what I think we've all read about Canada, we're really encouraged about both the medium- and long-term future there.","Blake W. Nordstrom - Co-President & Director","And, Jeff, you mentioned \u2013 this is Blake \u2013 about future, does it affect future growth plans in Canada, we've committed to six stores and we think we're in the best markets there. As we mentioned, we've got the two in Toronto this year and we have our final store, our third, which will be Toronto in 2017. We don't have any other plans. We're excited about these six stores that are in the best spots and doing the best job we can in those communities. I think there was an additional question there as well.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, comp store sales in full-line.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Yeah, I'm not sure if we broke those out in the...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We did.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","We did?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Where are they? Oh, they're right there.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're down 7%.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Okay. So for full-line stores, it was down 7.7%, and Rack was down 0.8% on a comp basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ed.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets","...on expanded loyalty program, how do we think about the gross margin impact and is this reward going to be materially different than those that have the credit card? And then I guess second, you guys mentioned you would look at store closures, would that be within the context of lease expirations or do you have a cohort of stores that are underperforming that you would consider terminating them ahead of lease renewal? Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ed. This is Mike. In terms of the loyalty program, we have factored in, we haven't broken out at this point specifically the impact of the gross profit, but we have factored that into our outlook. The non-tender program has a lower value element to it than the tender one does, and so we don't expect it to have the same impact from a margin standpoint. And we're certainly hoping that it has a very favorable impact from a loyalty and long-term sales benefit.","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","And on store closures, we have closed a small handful of stores over the last several years, and those were really all tied to lease expirations and the expiration of covenants. All of our stores are profitable. They all make money. So it's really not tied to performance; it's tied to when a lease or a covenant expires. We take a look at the long-term future of that store and that shopping center. And in some cases, we've found that by moving to a better location in that same town, in that same market, like we experienced recently in Los Angeles, we moved from South Bay Galleria to Del Amo Shopping Center about three miles away and we're having really good results there. And so, we're looking at those individual markets, nothing \u2013 no plans to announce now, but we are taking a look at them, and we think that there's going to be positive opportunities over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good evening.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Just a quick modeling question, Mike. The restructuring charges and the credit charge-back, how much of that account for in the change in the guidance for the year? Could you help us just directionally think about that as an incremental data point? And then if I could ask a quick follow-up. We were surprised to see kind of a large shift lower in the retail EBIT guidance, given a relatively small one-point change in the midpoint of the comp guidance. You guys have historically had some advantages in fixed versus floating SG&A because the big sales commission line in your cost structure. I mean has the leverage point on SG&A really changed that much this quickly, or can you walk us through some of the items that seem to be delevering pretty hard in the new guidance versus the old?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Michael. First, the first part of your question, the impact of the restructuring charges and the credit card charge-back activity was $0.10 or $30 million of pre-tax earnings for both the \u2013 primarily for the quarter and there's probably maybe a $0.01 or $0.02 impact in addition to that for the year.","In terms of the leverage point, I think what you're seeing is that we continue to invest in the long-term growth of the company, which is having an impact on the leverage of the company. And primarily, a lot of that is coming from the accelerated pace of the technology investment. Those dollars for the development of the tools that we're putting into place in the foundations that we're building not only come to the P&L but they go to our balance sheet and then find their way through the P&L relatively quickly. So that's a big element of it.","The other element, if you may recall, we opened the East Coast fulfillment center last fall. And so, we're still absorbing the incremental impact of the cost of that asset. So I would categorize the ability to leverage going forward as being more about the overall investments that we have made from an SG&A standpoint. And, of course, in addition to that, we're seeing some pressure on our gross margin.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","We'll now take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brian Tunick from RBC.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much, and good afternoon. My question really was on the full-line store comp decline, the down 7.7%. Was just hoping you could give some perspective. I guess a lot of us think your small store base, located primarily in any malls would certainly buck what we're hearing about other mall traffic trends. So it's been obviously many years since you've put up that kind of comp decline. You've had a couple more months now since energy and tourism have slowed. Do you have any more perspective on what's happening at your full-line stores right now?","James F. Nordstrom - Executive Vice President and President, Stores","Yeah, Brian, this is Jamie. I think it's been pretty well documented out there that mall traffic overall has been soft over the last probably couple quarters \u2013 we've seen some data recently over the last month or two that it was down, approaching double-digits. And we notice that. We are in \u2013 we're primarily in malls. And when we see mall traffic go down, it hurts us. And we can see that in certain areas of our business. Clearance sales is a good example of that. While our full-price, regular-price sales have been hanging in there, our clearance sales over the last quarter or two have really been down. And I think that jives with mall traffic being off. So we're looking at how can we, regardless of the mall that we're in, give the customer a compelling reason to make a trip to the store?","Obviously, that starts with the merchandise, but also has to do with the kind of services that we're offering. And we mentioned we're making big improvements in things like the buy online, pick up in store experience, things that we're doing online that flow into the store and vice versa. And so, we're encouraged by things that we have in our control to compel customers to want to go come to the store, and we're excited about starting to leverage some of the investments we've made over the next year or so in creating some of these new customers experiences.","Trina Schurman - Director-Investor Relations","Again, thank you for joining today's call.

Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to the Investor Relations section of nordstrom.com in. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Erik Nordstrom, Co-President; and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's first quarter performance and outlook for 2019. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, Co-President.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Erik.","Erik Nordstrom","Thank you for joining us today.","We believe our customer strategy and business model position us for long-term success. Our first quarter top-line results were below our expectations. We had planned for a continuation of soft sales trends from the fourth quarter with soft further deceleration relative to the plans we shared at the beginning of the year successfully executed on inventory and expense which helped to mitigate our sales trends.","We ended the quarter with inventories in solid shape and our financial position remains strong. We are confident in our leadership team's ability to better serve customers on their term and remain focused on achieving profitable growth. During the first quarter, we had some executional misses with the customer experience that had an impact on sales across Full-Price and Off-price both in stores and online. We know we disappoint our customers and we own it.","We've identified three factors that contributed to the sales miss; loyalty, digital marketing, and merchandise. These areas are within our control to turn around and we're already taking steps to course correct and drive the top line. I'd like to provide insight into what happened and how we're addressing all three areas.","Beginning with loyalty. We have a well-established program with nearly 12 million active customers contributing more than 60% of sales in the first quarter. Last fall, we evolved the program with the introduction of the Nordy Club, which allows customers to earn reward notes faster and provides early access to product and events. However, the execution of our rollout was not as successful as we had planned. As part of our decision to move to a digital-first program, we eliminated paper notes, but later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these notes by mail. As a result, we saw a reduction in traffic across Full-Price and Off-Price. We are resolving these issues and our initial results showed improving trends for engagement, traffic and spend from our loyalty customers.","The second factor is related to digital marketing. We deliberately reduced our digital marketing as we shifted resources to loyalty. With The Nordy Club rollout not ramping as we had projected, we experienced incremental traffic declines in our business. We have since increased our investments in digital marketing to drive traffic and sales.","The third factor was merchandise. The breadth of our offering across brands, price points, and styles is a key differentiator in serving customers. We have opportunities to rebalance our assortment mix to better resonate with customers in Full-Price and Off-Price. This includes Women's Apparel, which continued to have the toughest results in Full-Price. Beauty was another callout for the quarter, given the highly promotional environment and increased out of stock levels. It will take some time to adjust our merchandise assortment, but we have already started this process and expect improvement in the second half of the year.","All three factors, loyalty, digital marketing, and merchandise contributed to a slowdown in digital sales growth of 7% in the first quarter, relative to last year's annual growth of 16%.","We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top-line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses, which Anne will discuss in more detail. Our strength is our commitment to the customer, and we know we have areas for improvement. Over the years, we have managed through many cycles, which give us confidence in our ability to adjust our business to better serve customers.","Our entire leadership team has a high degree of urgency to improve our top-line and profitability. Additionally, the team is focused on executing the following three key strategies this year:","First, our local market strategy enables increased customer engagement through services and greater access to merchandise selection, with faster delivery, and at a lower cost to us. Last year, we launched in Los Angeles, our largest market, with four full-line stores and three Nordstrom Local service hubs. During the first quarter, we continued to see positive outcomes with outsized growth in digital sales and store traffic in this market. In addition, nearly one-third of order pickup services are done in our three Nordstrom Locals. We're planning to reach scale in the LA market, including 16 full-line stores, by further leveraging inventory through our supply chain investments.","Moving to our second key strategy, our market share gains in Los Angeles give us added confidence as we expand our presence in New York City, our largest market for online sales. We are on track to open our flagship on October 24, along with two Nordstrom Local hubs this fall. We expect these physical assets to greatly add to our ability to engage with customers across multiple touch points. We know that engaged customers spend more, which is expected to result in a meaningful sales lift for this important market.","With our third strategy, we're focused on improving the customer experience during our two key events. Our Anniversary Sale is a unique event, offering brand new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. We're curating our assortment to focus on our customers' favorite brands. We're also extending the pre-shop period for our top loyalty customers. For Holiday, we're aiming to make Nordstrom more of a gift-giving destination for both new and existing customers. This includes amplifying our gifting assortment, across categories and with more accessible price points.","In closing, we own our results, and we're focused on getting our sales back on track. As always, the customer is at the center of everything we do and through that lens, we're committed to better serving them on their terms.","Now Anne will discuss our financial results and outlook.","Anne Bramman","Thank you, Erik. I'd like to reiterate that we have taken immediate action to better serve customers, drive top-line and improve profitability. As we continue to focus on making our business more efficient and productive, we're aggressively bending the expense curve and managing our inventories.","Turning to our top-line results, total company sales were down 3.5%, with Full-Price down 5.1% and Off-Price down 0.6%. The drivers of our sales shortfall \u2013 loyalty, digital marketing, and merchandise contributed to decelerating trends in our key operating metrics, which include trips and customer engagement. Although we missed our sales expectations by several hundred basis points, we were able to offset roughly half of this miss through our merchandise margin and expense performance. In fact, the sales shortfall in Off-Price was fully offset by the team's ability to control expenses and manage inventory levels down significantly.","Moving to gross profit, our rate was down 60 basis points relative to last year due to planned markdowns and occupancy deleverage. We ended the quarter in a solid inventory position, with a positive spread of 180 basis points relative to sales. This allows us to be agile in responding to changes in customer expectations. As we continue into the second quarter, we have planned inventory based on current sales trends and we remain disciplined in our buys as we work to improve our merchandise offering.","From an expense standpoint, our SG&A rate increased 168 basis points relative to last year. This was entirely due to fixed cost deleverage on lower sales. We're making further structural enhancements to our operating model as we implement several efficiency initiatives related to three areas, improvements to our store operating model; productivity gains in technology and supply chain; and reduced discretionary spend.","We expect these initiatives to ramp up over the year and we're ahead of our plans with $35 million realized in the first quarter. This included operational changes in stores to better align with how customers are shopping. For example, we're improving services that have a direct customer impact, such as order fulfillment in full-line stores and faster checkout at the Rack. All these initiatives represent permanent reductions in our cost structure, which positions us well for strong EBIT flow-through going forward.","Another lever of improved profitability is our generational investments. Over the past decade, we invested early in our digital capabilities and new markets. This is the last year of our generational investment cycle, and we're already seeing returns. These investments are continuing to scale and are expected to deliver top-line growth and improved profitability this year.","Our financial position remains strong, enabling us to be flexible in changing business conditions. We have a healthy balance sheet and generated annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion over the past decade. Our consistent and balanced capital allocation approach enables us to maintain an investment grade credit rating. We also returned approximately $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.","Moving to our annual outlook, we revised EPS from a range of $3.65 to $3.90 to a range of $3.25 to $3.65. This incorporates a sales decline of 2% to flat growth for the year, relative to our prior outlook of a 1% to 2% increase. We expect it's going take some time to see improvement as we further adjust our merchandise offering and lap the operational issues from The Nordy Club rollout. We anticipate first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter, with gradual improvement beginning in the second half of the year. For credit revenue, we're planning for a low- to mid-single-digit increase based on our current sales trends.","From a bottom-line perspective, we expect an EBIT margin range of 5.3% to 5.8%, compared to our prior outlook of 5.9% to 6.1%.","From a gross profit and SG&A perspective, the change in our assumptions is driven by greater fixed cost deleverage from lowered sales expectations. We expect gross profit, at the mid-point of our outlook, to be relatively flat to last year. This reflects improved merchandise margins offset by occupancy deleverage.","For SG&A, we expect moderate deleverage, when excluding the estimated credit charge in 2018. We've also incorporated expense savings at the high end of our original range of $150 million to $200 million. These savings are expected to be back-half weighted as we make further progress on our various initiatives.","For the second quarter, we expect our Anniversary event to perform in-line with our current sales trends, which has been our historical experience. Our second quarter gross profit rate deleverage is planned similar to Q1, due to lower sales. We also expect SG&A to deleverage, but to a lesser extent than Q1 due to further expense savings.","Specific to Anniversary, we're making changes to improve the overall economics of the event. As a result, we expect expanded merchandise margins in the third quarter from better sell-through of Anniversary product, which should result in lower markdowns. Please also refer to our slides for additional color on our quarterly timing assumptions.","In closing, we're making hard choices as we focus on better serving customers, driving top-line, and improving profitability. We know we must demonstrate this commitment with our results in the coming months and look forward to updating you on our progress.","I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A.","Trina Schurman","Thank you, Anne. Before we get started with Q&A We would appreciate it, if you can limit to one question to allow everyone a chance to ask a question. We will now move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Yruma","Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. Thanks for giving the diagnostic on the issues you suffered in the quarter. I guess if you could click down a little bit on maybe talk more specifically about Rack. It seems like a lot of what you spoke about was related to the ecom business and the full line. And as you look at Rack kind of how should we think of that progression and proving to the course the year? Thank you.","Erik Nordstrom","Hi, Ed. This is Erik. I'll take that one. Well, first of all, start with the subject we touched on kind of cross Full-Price and Off-Price, so good notes digital marketing certainly affected our off-price business as well both in-store and online. We also have merchandise mix issues to get after within off-price as well. And when you get into the details off-price is a little different than full-price. There's some variance department by department, but that mix and you know as well that mix is so vital that mix we have across off-price to full-price that makes the price points that we have the mix of styles.","We have a pretty broad range of customers that we look to serve and a precise mix is super important in delivering that and when we get out of balance it really affects our top-line. So, we have those issues in off-price.","The other bucket I'd call out is, we did enter the year with a plan to improve our profitability in off-price. And part of that plan was eliminating some unprofitable events. Specifically, we reduced the number of flash events that we've had on Outlook. Some of those were not profitable. We reduced, clear the racks event in the quarter and we did eliminate some of the very lowest price point merchandise we had on our off-price e-commerce business.","We did get the profitability improvement from those decisions. The effect on the top-line was greater than we had planned. And we look at that and we see opportunities to not blow up that strategy but to make some adjustments to it that we've been can and will help our top-line.","Edward Yruma","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Alexandra Walvis","Hi, there. Thanks so much for taking my question. You outlined the drivers of the change to the guidance for this full year. I wonder as we reflect on the last couple of quarters whether you're thinking any differently at this stage about some of the long-term guidance that you gave at Investor Day from last year or even the trajectory to move towards that?","Anne Bramman","Hi, Alex. This is Anne. On the long-term profitability target, at this stage we have a lot of the year left to deliver, so that 70% year left to deliver. And we talked about the path that we gave in the Investor Day financial goals. We're playing now a little bit different, so we could talk a little bit about the gross profit levers that we were pulling there. We're proceeding on those and we're getting the terms that we need. [Indiscernible] accelerating the expense savings principally on making structural change on that. So, the good news is once we get the top-line back on course, the flow through should actually be greater than what we had signaled in the Investor Day. So right now, we just want to play out the rest of the year, get back on track with the initiatives we've talked about and then see where we land in the year before we update.","Alexandra Walvis","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the earlier comments about taking some steps to drive the profit improvement at Rack. I'm wondering on the slide where you show the generational investment detail. It looks like you've reduced your profit expectations for the Rack.com, Trunk Club, Canada bucket. Could you just talk a little bit about that I mean presumably that's some of the sales reduction that you're seeing, but just any other clarity and how you're looking at kind of the profit contribution from that generational investment and sort of what the path should look like over the course of the next one to two years? Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Hi, Mark. Yes. I think you're right. We did take slightly down the top-line and the profit improvement pieces too. And it's really about [indiscernible] Trunk Club, the current business and it's just in line with the sales decline that we've seen in general for the quarter and we've given guidance for the year. There's nothing else strikingly different with that. And once we get again we'll pull the levers and get back on track. We should see better clothes coming through on that.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Paul Trussell","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I'm also referring to the slide deck, you give some assistance with timing of assumptions. And just wanted to inquire about some of the second half comments that you make, if you could just maybe walk us through how we should think about the impact of the NYC opening to revenues. What are the drivers behind the second half merchandise margin expansion. And then, anything else just to be mindful of as it relates to second half versus first half? Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes. So based on high level commentary on it as you mentioned, we really did try to expand out the assumptions that we've been given -- that we're giving you as far as how the first half, second half of the quarter plays out. So, for detailed model question though I'd just refer you to Trina after the earnings call. But just stepping back and looking at the high level story, so we would expect to see some gradual improvement that really more towards the back half of second half of the year on the top-line component to it. New York is a key piece of it as for the tower opening and entering that market with our local -- our local market strategy.","But really the pieces that we're seeing coming through in the EBIT side is really getting more benefit out of the extensive initiatives with SG&A and continuing to hold the strategies we have on our merch margin. Primarily with anniversary I talked about in my opening comment having a higher sell-through should help particularly in Q3. And then, as you exit out of the year, we expect to see the flow through from that as well as the SG&A savings.","Paul Trussell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. At full-price, I guess as you dissect the softness that you're currently seeing in women's apparel and the beauty category. How are you thinking about the timing for improvement? Do you think the issue is differentiation of the merchandise or is it more value proposition? And like you talked about some more entry level price points. And I guess just near-term what are the actions you're taking to stabilize these two businesses.","Pete Nordstrom","Yes. This is Pete. They are different. With beauty, we had some things that happened to us that they're relatively discrete I think of nature. We had some out of stock issues. That was a result of just being in stock and really getting it from the vendor, our vendor partners there were some issues there that we think will mostly be behind us you're pretty quick.","We also had a lot of price promotion issues in beauty and that caused some problems with it. But I think it's -- beauty it's been consistently good performer for us over years. We kind of look at that track record and we expect that that will get back on track pretty quickly.","With women's apparel, we have some more broad-based issues a lot of it has to do with the balance and price that Erik talked a little bit about. I think in particular finding ways to appeal more to young customers kind of in the range of what we do there to women's apparel. I think we know we need to do there and the good news is that part of the business churns relatively quickly. But I think in terms of really being able to make the changes we feel like we need to make that's going to take a few months.","So, I think on the whole women's apparel and beauty is a subset of all, but I think it's fair to say that more broadly we definitely have an opportunity to be better connected with customers in terms of the relevance that we have to offer and the relatively price points is probably the biggest lever there.","Matthew Boss","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please proceed.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon guys. And could you just remind us what percent of your expense structure is fixed versus variable now? Just recognizing the deleverage from the lower sales I thought you had a pretty variable expense model. So, any thoughts or help there. And then, just any way to quantify maybe on a full year basis what each point of comp pressure does to the annual margin? Thanks.","Anne Bramman","I don't think we've given the explicit details between fixed and variable, but what I can say is, in the full-price business in particular it's the variable models that are off-prices given the special structure for sales force going forward.","Having said that as far as the copies too, I think what you can see even if you want to -- for haven't guidance for the year is that we're actually shifting that a bit. So, if you think through our midpoint which is down 1%, the flow through actually is a little bit better given the fact that we are holding the strategy on course margin as well as SG&A. So, I think if you would do the reverse logistics on that you can see that, it is over time as we make these structural changes, we would need less of a top-line growth in Nordy Club flow through.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. Thanks. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Anne Bramman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.","Chuck Grom","Thanks. Good afternoon. I'm just trying to reconcile your comments about taking some time to fix some of the issues in the merchandise side of the issues here for you guys with your comp, the implied acceleration on the two-year stack. So maybe just help us walk through, how it's going to improve both on the full line and then also on the Rack?","Anne Bramman","So, I think probably just to frame up a little bit as far as the guidance we've given. So, when you look at the weighting between first half and second half will not offset significantly based if you look at the top-line sales growth -- or top-line sales guidance that we've given between first and second half it's not all that awful you've seen historically. The only change is the fact that you've got the New York market opening up which looks slightly higher for second half in the top line. So, when we look at the overall stack, what we're assuming is that yes, you might get back on track on this sort of side and the good news is our inventory position is very good place. We've got a couple of pockets just looking through, but exiting out of the quarter allows us to be very agile, reactive as we start rebalancing and [indiscernible]. So, that's the great news on [indiscernible] is allowing us to mitigate some of the top-line issues.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. Anne you talked about making SG&A more efficient. I'm just wondering if the company has considered making more aggressive cost cuts across the organization? And if not, do you think there are areas that are opportunities or represent opportunities for that kind of initiative. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes, Kimberly. So, when I talk about the savings that we're going after, we're actually ahead of our plans. And we'll be at the higher end of the 200 million we've planned that's better than what we had shared at the Investor Day last year. And let me put those in three broad buckets that we're going after. First is productivity, end to end productivity primarily in technology and supply chain. So those are some very big structural pieces. It takes some time to work through those, but those are some big buckets that we're going after productivity perspective.","The second piece we've already implemented which are still operating model changes that I talked about in my opening comments and that was a piece that actually gets us back in line with what the customer wants, but also helps drive efficiency stores as well. And then I think of the smaller bucket, I would talk about is the discretionary side. So, it's really not that that -- it's the smaller component of what we're looking at in the cost savings that we have. And so that's how I would frame it.","Now what I would also say is that we're continuing to look for opportunities to drive more productivity in the business. And so, we will continue to invest in doing the right things for the customer and we'll continue to invest in the business, but we're also going to look at how we can make sure that our consensus structure stays in line with whatever trends we see in our top-line.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. It's a follow-up on the last question. One other -- do you think there's anything that you might have cut back on from a SG&A perspective it might be negatively impacting the top-line either in the full price business or direct business? And then just separately curious about the reduction on the credit line if that is simply a reflection of lower sales expectations or if there's something going on in the credit portfolio that you could share with us? Thanks.","Anne Bramman","Hi, Paul. So, I'll start with the cuts component to it. And I don't know, Erik if you want to chime in as well, I will give some [indiscernible] on this current credit. So when we look at the SG&A component to it, I think what you'll see is, it's really driving more efficiency and we don't believe it is impacting the top-line. And we talked about the drivers, the top-line was really about the exit from the executional opportunities we had with Nordy Club. Some of the digital marketing component as well as the assortment.","We have gotten back into the marketing component which is baked into our SG&A line, if you're offsetting that. And then, on the credit side we, have talked about this in the last call, if you recall that we are anniversarying a credit acquisition or customer acquisition from last year, we'll finish our anniversary in the second quarter. And then, we look at the guidance for the year it's really exciting to what we are seeing with the sales trends and nothing [indiscernible] credit. I don't know if Erik\u2026","Erik Nordstrom","I will add a little color on that. With loyalty and marketing, our missteps were not motivated by cutting expenses. We're actually invested in our loyalty program. We upped the points from two points for every dollar spent to three points. We added a number of experiences to the program, which are actually resonating very well with the customers. But in having the executional issues around the notes, directly affected our digital marketing plan by investing in loyalty, we moved marketing dollars there and away from retention and activation in our digital marketing. So, our missteps with the loyalty program exacerbated or issues in digital marketing and they're certainly connected and they are not driven by expense.","Another thing I'd call out is in our stores both in Racks and in our full-line stores. We have executed some model changes in our stores. Again, not driven mainly by expense but we've been on this journey for a while. Clearly, our model needs to change. Our business model of which was born in bricks and mortar stores and define what the role of stores are. We think we have real good clarity on that.","Our stores still that role of having great sales people who are taking care of one customer at a time and making some genuine human connection that that's in our DNA that's continue to be important. But increasingly stores play a fulfillment role. Their locations where customers can pick up online orders and their locations that we fill online orders from. So, we have moved our labor model in our stores to reflect what customers want and need. And there are efficiency opportunities in there, but I wouldn't say that it's been a blunt force of getting our expense cuts. I would say that that's been done with, oh boy, how is the customer's needs changing what are they looking for? How can we leverage the physical assets we have in stores and the people in our stores and the inventory in our stores to better serve them on their terms. And that's actually gone really well this quarter.","Paul Lejuez","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question here. So, if I look at the -- I'm just looking a quick or tactical question on the lease accounting. I know there was some change in the accounting, but it looks like it was -- in the ROIC calculation you guys given in the press release significantly lower than last year. I think you report just over 200 versus 250 last year. I think that would be one of the positive contributors to the gross margin in the quarter and it's just since it's down so much in that. I want to see if you can maybe help us think through how much that contributed to gross in the quarter and is that kind of a level that we'll see going forward under the new accounting. And then I had a quick follow up.","Anne Bramman","Yes. From the lease accounting, we actually have disclosure in the press release and supplemental. Trina can walk you through that. What I would say broadly is that it really had no material impact at all to our financials and likely it was less than a tenth of a point at the time. So, I think Trina can walk you through that. As far as the overall balance sheet and the income statement there were virtually no materials impact at all.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks for that. So, I guess -- I just want to step back a minute and think a little bit bigger picture here. And you guys have given some good tactical thoughts on how your approach in merchandising and loyalty and everything in light of the recent sales volatility. But if we look at full price, the dollar level of that business is in the same place it was in 2014. And guys have done a nice job of -- one of the premier dot.com businesses in the sector. Obviously, it's well known that brick and mortar department stores have had traffic challenges, but how do you think bigger picture about what you think the full price business needs to become a bigger business that's back on track to higher revenue base. If these current dynamics that we see in the marketplace continue to be headwinds going forward.","Erik Nordstrom","Hey, Michael. This is Erik. I will like to take that. Specifically, we would point to our local market strategy. Let me be clear that is our model for the future. We started in LA last year and it really started with engagement. How do we engage with customers by leveraging both our digital and physical assets. And that included experimenting with new physical assets in the Nordstrom local service hubs. That engagement part across services and across channels and we know we've got a lot of data on that and we know the more we engage with customers across channels and services the more they spend. That's gone really, really well.","The second part of the local market strategy is leveraging the inventory that is close to our customers either in our stores or in our supply chain facilities. We're not as deep into that. We've started being able to leverage the inventory -- start with our four core stores in Los Angeles and a good example would be [indiscernible] buy online, pickup at store. Where we went from the available inventory for [indiscernible] being one specific store's inventory to connecting the four stores and be able to pick it up either at those four stores or one of the three Nordstrom Local service hubs we have.","And we've talked about it before the outsized growth we're seeing in [indiscernible] across our company. The growth in [indiscernible] in Los Angeles is about 2x that we're seeing elsewhere in the company. So here is a massive piece of engagement that customers love that we think we can do in a fairly unique way and really do it on customers terms that drives higher engagement drives bigger spend. Ultimately our local market strategy success metric is gaining market share in these markets and we have seen that in Los Angeles. We're in the midst right now of expanding our local market services from those core four stores to all 16 full-line stores in Los Angeles. We are on pace to bring our learnings to New York when we open the Tower. We have two Nordstrom Local service hubs planned on the island. And we're well positioned to execute that in New York. And then, our plan is next year to take that to our biggest markets across our portfolio","So, that is our model. It leads with service engagement across channels and services and it leads with leveraging inventory to get customers a greater selection to them faster and add better economics for us. And we think that's the future of our full-price business.","Michael Binetti","Thanks. That's helpful.","Trina Schurman","I think Michael, we will now take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please proceed.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. In light of the revised guidance, it looks like you're still going to be outside of your targeted leverage range. So, wondering if you could share with us any conversations you might have had with the rating agencies as to whether there might be any change in how they're looking at your current ratings or potentially the outlook that they have on those ratings. Thank you.","Anne Bramman","Yes. So, we remain very comfortable with our range and we expect to be in line with our expectations or historical level by the end of the year. And we've talked about this a lot, but we have a very consistent capital allocation approach. And so, we remain committed to be an investment grade company and we look at our balance sheet. And so, as we think about the guiding principle around cap allocation that is a big piece of that.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Great. Thank you so much.","Trina Schurman","Thank you for joining today's call. A replay along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks will be available for one year on our Web site.

And I would now like to introduce Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.","Trina Schurman - Director, Investor Relations, Nordstrom, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today's earnings call will last 45 minutes and we'll include 30 minutes for your questions. Before we begin, I want to mention that our speakers will be referring to slides, which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section.","Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide showing our Safe Harbor language.","Participating in today's call are Blake Nordstrom, President; and Mike Koppel, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the company's fourth quarter and 2014 performance in addition to outlook for fiscal 2015. Joining during the Q&A session will be Pete Nordstrom, President of Merchandising; and Erik Nordstrom, President of Direct.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reflect on the year, we consider 2014 to be a watershed moment in our company history with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth and the launch of nordstromrack.com, the acquisition of Trunk Club and the decision to explore the potential sale of our credit receivables.","These milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience that they expect from us. Several years ago we began our path to accelerate growth in multiple channels as we evolve with the changing needs of our customers. In 2014 we delivered tangible results in executing our strategy over the last several years. Today we made Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies, ranking number 14 overall and leading in our category.","We continued to see the ongoing evolution of retail with the accelerated growth in e-commerce, the continuing importance of stores and the increasing customer interaction between them. Customers increasingly expect a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. We're uniquely positioned to serve customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities.","We also believe we are competitively advantaged by serving customers better through our multiple touch points in full-price, off-price, stores and online. As a result we have more customers shopping with us and more customers shopping two or more channels. This is meaningful as customers who shop multiple channels spend more and demonstrate greater loyalty.","In 2014 we reached an important milestone with the Rack, representing our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly four million. Additionally, about 1\/3 of our Rack customers also shop in our full-price business.","A year ago, we enabled customers to return purchases from HauteLook and nordstromrack.com to any of Rack stores. This singular capability drove nearly one million incremental trips to our Rack stores. In 2014 we expanded our capabilities to ensure we're relevant today and in the future. Our first store in Calgary far exceeded our expectations, reflecting a multi-year effort from our team to address the unique challenges of crossing a border. In the U.S. we increased our presence with two full-line stores in Jacksonville, Florida and Houston, Texas. They feature our award winning design concepts that incorporate flexibility and light.","In the Rack, we reached a record number of 27 store openings which contributed to Rack's total sales growth of 17%. We've expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of HauteLook in 2011, which has grown nearly 150% in three years. HauteLook launched nordstromrack.com in the spring, adding to its strong growth trajectory. We more than doubled selection since the launch, with accelerated sales growth for the combined business in the second half of the year. Finally we strengthened our multi-channel capabilities when we acquired Trunk Club, a high growth business that offers a new approach to personalized service.","In 2014 we also added capabilities to enhance the customer experience with an emphasis on convenience. This includes an upgraded point-of-sale system in addition to ongoing enhancements to mobile, the online checkout process and texting tools for our salespeople. We consider our product offering to be a key differentiator in providing customers with the top brands they want. This is enabled through our vendor partnerships and our own product group, where we can provide vendors new channels of distribution that are beneficial for our vendors and the overall customer experience.","In our full-price business we tripled our selection on nordstrom.com since 2011. In the Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands. In addition when brands participate in dual-flash events, on nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, we've seen a lift in brand sales across all four channels. Most recently we announced our partnership with Madewell, starting with an offering in 15 stores and online. Similar to our partnerships with Topshop and Charlotte Tilbury, this is another way to enhance our product offering and create excitement for both new and existing customers.","As we look ahead to 2015, we have a number of growth initiatives planned in support of our efforts to improve the customer experience, including our ongoing expansion in Canada with a store opening in Ottawa in the spring and Vancouver in the fall. In the U.S., we plan to expand our retail presence with three new full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee. We also plan to open 27 Rack stores this year and roughly 25 stores in 2016. Since we announced our growth plans a couple of years ago, we now see a clear path to reach 300 Rack stores by 2020.","Our supply chain capabilities are another key element in enhancing the customer experience through faster delivery. This fall, we are planning to open a third fulfillment center located in Pennsylvania. Having fulfillment centers closer to the customer will enable us to offer two-day shipping for free to more customers.","We will continue to fuel our fastest-growing businesses through deeper integration and capabilities. Trunk Club doubled its sales in 2014, and has planned to double its sales again this year.","From a merchandise perspective, we've enjoyed our partnership with Topshop over the last two years, which has attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Based on the great reception we've heard from customers, we expect to expand the offer from roughly 50 doors to over 80 doors this year. In addition, a new partnership with Madewell is another way for us to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers.","And finally, we view our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program as an important way for us to deepen our engagement with customers and attract new customers. Rewards members represent 40% of our sales volume. We welcomed over 1 million new members in 2014, a 15% increase from the previous year. We would like to give customers more choices with our loyalty program, and our goal is to provide an integrated, multi-tender program. Last year, we piloted an extension of our offering in Texas and in our first store in Canada. Based on the strong customer response, we look forward to rolling out the expanded program to all stores and online in the second half of the year.","In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy as we evolve with our customers through our focus on service, product and capabilities. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up another year, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in executing our customer strategy. Our efforts to provide a best-in-class customer experience are centered on service, product and capabilities. To reinforce Blake's comments, our strategy is driven by the changing expectations of our customers.","As our business evolves with the customer, the way we create value is evolving too. Over the last several years we have accelerated our investments to fuel growth across our businesses in full-price, off-price stores and online. About a decade ago, we started on a path of developing our multi-channel capabilities by integrating our buying teams and inventory platform. In 2011 we accelerated online growth starting with enhanced capabilities in e-commerce through the addition of talent, our acquisition of HauteLook and advancements in technology.","In 2012 we announced our planned investments in new growth opportunities including our entry into Canada, our Manhattan flagship store and the accelerated expansion of the Rack. Not only do these growth initiatives support our customer strategy, we expect these investments to drive top line growth and deliver returns accretive to our business.","Since then, in addition to executing our growth plans we have increased our focus on our enterprise capabilities to enable a more seamless customer experience. This is reflected in the significant milestones achieved in 2014, including the launch of nordstromrack.com, our successful entry into Canada and the extension of our service approach through the acquisition of Trunk Club. As we look ahead, we plan to further leverage our strategic capabilities through technology, supply chain, merchandising and marketing.","Now let's turn to our current financial results. We achieved our expectations for 2014, reflecting consistent strength in our sales trends and our investments to fuel growth. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line with record sales of over $13 billion. Our sales growth of 7.8% and comparable sales increase of 4% were ahead of our expectations. Our ongoing investments contributed to top line growth of roughly 25% from three years ago. Not only did our overall business generate growth, we've aggressively invested in Rack stores and e-commerce which collectively make up over 40% of our sales today, up from 30% three years ago.","Return on invested capital was 12.6% reflecting a 50 basis point reduction related to the Trunk Club acquisition and the accelerated pace of capital investments that have roughly doubled since 2011.","For the sixth consecutive year we generated operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Through our balanced capital allocation approach this past year we re-invested roughly $750 million back in the business and returned $860 million directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced last week our quarterly dividend which increased 12% over last year.","Earnings per diluted share of $3.72 were consistent with our prior outlook of $3.70 to $3.75. Our results also included a $0.13 reduction from the Trunk Club acquisition which was incorporated in our prior outlook.","Now, I'd like to comment further on our fourth quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.32 were a result of continued sales strength and operating execution. We achieved total sales growth of 9% and a comparable sales increase of 4.7% reflecting a strong holiday performance. In our full-price business trends in full-line stores showed sequential improvement over the year with nordstrom.com demonstrating continued momentum. In our off-price business the Rack rebounded from the softness experienced late in the third quarter and our combined channel of nordstromrack.com and HauteLook delivered the highest growth.","Moving to inventory and gross profit, we corrected our excess inventory at the Rack. We exited the year with inventory aligned to an appropriate level and gross profit performance consistent with our expectations. We are on track to achieve our goals of top quartile shareholder return driven by a high single digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. We believe this will lead us to be a $20 billion-plus business by 2020 while creating significant shareholder value.","As we've shared with you previously we expect operating margins to reflect the near-term impact of our customer strategy. This includes investments in stores and online growth, the expansion into Canada and foundational capabilities. As a result we anticipate that these investments will contribute to double digit increases in depreciation and rent. EBITDAR, which excludes these components, provides an indication of our core operating performance. We continue to focus on profitable growth in our core business which is reflected by EBITDAR growth in line with sales growth. Additionally, we've made meaningful progress in increasing our operating efficiencies particularly in our full-line business and continue to evaluate our operating model throughout the company.","Moving to our capital plan, we expect to invest $4.3 billion or 5% of sales over the next five years. Technology is 35% of the plan reflecting an increased shift towards foundational investments. This includes a merchandising solution that enables our growth and a seamless integration across our multiple channels. It also includes the expansion of our fulfillment network. This not only supports a $2.5 billion online business today that is anticipated to grow by over $1 billion in the next several years but also enables an integrated customer experience across stores and online.","New markets representing Canada and Manhattan make up 25% and new stores are 18%. The balance of 22% relates to reinvestment in stores, significantly down from 40% over the last five years due to our remodel prioritization towards high profile stores and improved efficiencies.","Now I'd like to provide additional color on our 2015 capital plan of approximately $1.2 billion. Relative to our five-year capital plan, we expect that this year will represent our peak level of investment at roughly 8% of sales. The step-up in 2015 compared to $750 million in 2014 is primarily driven by new stores, including flagship stores in Vancouver, Toronto, and Manhattan. In addition, the plan incorporates three flagship store remodels in Seattle, Chicago, and San Francisco, and a new East Coast fulfillment center. As the pace of investments begins to moderate beyond 2015, we expect to see an improvement in earnings growth.","Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2015 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.80 incorporates total sales growth of 7% to 9%. We are planning a comparable store increase of 2% to 4% based on current trends. Our sales outlook assumes in full-price flat comparable sales at full-line stores and roughly a 20% total sales increase from our online business of nordstrom.com and Trunk Club with mid-teens growth at nordstrom.com.","In off-price, Rack total sales growth in the low double digits with a low single digit comparable sales increase and roughly a 25% increase from our combined channel of nordstromrack.com and HauteLook.","Other considerations incorporated in our outlook impacting gross profit and SG&A include the following. The rollout into Canada, estimated as an EBIT loss of $60 million compared to $32 million in 2014. This increase includes infrastructure and preopening costs of new stores. As we shared with you previously, we believe this market ultimately represents a $1 billion-plus sales opportunity. We expect this level of loss will begin to decline in 2017 and will become accretive as we reach scale.","In addition, we anticipate $30 million in expenses associated with growth enablers, comprised of the additional fulfillment center and our expanded loyalty program planned in the second half of 2015. There is also an EBIT loss of roughly $30 million related to Trunk Club compared with a loss of $25 million in 2014. The dilutive impact is expected to moderate in 2016 resulting from increased operating profitability. These growth initiatives contribute to our 20% planned increase in depreciation and rent expense in 2015. EBITDAR when excluding the impact of Canada and Trunk Club is anticipated to grow roughly with sales.","Please also refer to the earnings release for additional assumptions and timing considerations contemplated in our outlook.","Before we close, we'd like to comment that the process in regards to our potential sale of our credit receivables is expected to wrap up in the first half of 2015. We look forward to our opportunities ahead as we continue on our path to provide a best-in-class customer experience and deliver top quartile shareholder returns.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina.","Trina Schurman - Director, Investor Relations, Nordstrom, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit to one question. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Yvonne, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question today is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Capital (sic) [Cowen and Company] (19:00).","Oliver Chen - Cowen Group, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Congrats to a solid finish and all the innovative initiatives ahead. We had a question related to the activity around the port slowdown and the earlier Easter. Do you feel like that's within your plans in terms of what you're seeing? Or how does that impact you in terms of your vendors? And just a quick follow-up; what's driving the main rationale behind your gross margin guidance? Do you feel like Rack is in a good place with respect to inventory? Thank you.","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","Oliver, this is Blake. I'll take the first part regarding the supply chain. Through the fourth quarter, we had some minor impacts but we felt it was immaterial. It predominantly, though, can impact flow, and as we have said for some time, our ability to have freshness and flow is important with our customers. So we watch it closely, and of late it's been more in the news. Pete was just in market and I know a number of the vendors are talking about it, but we have a pretty balanced approach and we work closely with our vendor partners. And to date, we've been able to manage it fairly well. But our team's watching it closely. I'll turn the gross margin part over to Mike.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Oliver, this is Mike. Our assumptions in gross margin was primarily driving that slight decrease from 2014 is occupancy costs, and it's the occupancy costs related to the continued growth of the Rack as well as the new stores we're opening, particularly the new ones in Canada.","Oliver Chen - Cowen Group, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Best regards.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our new question is from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo.","Paul L. Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Just wondering what you see Trunk Club ultimately growing to on the top line? And how do you think about the profitability of that business in a more mature state? Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","This is Erik. As mentioned, Trunk Club was on a real high growth rate, more than doubled last year and it is planned to double again this year. We haven't publicly stated, but we think ultimately it can be, but we think it's a big business. I think it's safe to say that. Right now our focus is mainly around supporting their growth plan and there's areas like supply chain, alterations, some supply right around vendors that we can help them with. We had just last week here in Seattle, their Custom business which \u2013 you may know they have three parts to their business, they have the Trunk business that's basically online personal styling, they have five showrooms and the third part is their Custom business that they've taken on road before. We actually have that road show in our Downtown Seattle store last week and they're just at the very beginning of starting to find some synergies there. So that business, without being specific I'll tell you we think it could be very big.","The other part is a little less formal (22:11) is what they can do for our stores. Like that customer experience, we're testing some things there but we do believe there's ways they can help us. As you know our personal styling program, our stores is about 1,500 stylists that have been very important part of our growth. They do some different things with their styling. We think we can learn on them.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Paul, this is Mike. I would also add, you may recall when we originally bought the business we indicated one of the things that we were impressed with was for a startup how quickly they had moved to breakeven operating profitability and we're learning a lot in terms of a small business that can scale relatively quickly and that also can apply some of those ways of doing business in a highly personalized way to be very profitable. So we're excited about what we can learn there as well.","Paul L. Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. So on capital priorities, you outlined that this year the $1.2 billion will be the multi-year peak and then you talked about an improved earnings growth rate following 2015. Could you just elaborate a little bit on the drivers of that?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Matthew, this is Mike. Yes, well, 2015, there's a lot going on as we articulated, we've got some significant investments in our store openings in Canada which include some pretty large stores in Vancouver and Toronto, we have the continued ongoing investment in Manhattan which right now is purely a capital investment but is a fair amount of capital. And then in addition we are investing in our infrastructure to support all this growth \u2013 this growth is a wonderful thing but if you don't have the tools and systems to support it, it's not going to work very well. And so what you're seeing here is a kind of a coming together of a lot of activity in this year.","Post 2015 as we start to see those capital outlays somewhat moderate and become more consistent, we should see the operating model start to catch up a little bit more for those investments and we should start to see earnings growth to be a little bit better than it's been in the last couple of years.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Market (sic) [Topeka Capital Markets] (24:38).","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Just wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the loyalty business. Clearly, you've continued to see impressive growth there helping to drive sales. And I was just curious the comment you made about more customers shopping in multiple channels. Clearly, that's a great driver too. So, in terms of the number of customers you added, what's the total number of customers you've got in the various loyalty programs at this point? And what percentage of that customer base, are actually shopping in multiple channels? And then just a little bit of color on the expanded program that you've piloted, if you could.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Dorothy, this is Mike. We've for the last roughly five years seen some really strong growth in our Nordstrom rewards program and that has been driven by program that has been entirely connected to one of our tenders, whether it's our debit card, whether it's our private label credit card, or our co-branded Visa card. And one of the things that we learned with our pilot this last year is we have a lot of customers out there and a lot of potential future customers that would love to engage with us but don't necessarily want to open up another tender.","And so the addition to our overall loyalty offering is going to include a tender-neutral offering, which we're not going to disclose specifics yet but we will have a way of connecting with those customers other than through a credit card or a debit card. And the test we had both in Canada and in Texas really had some great results and reinforced to us that this is another way that we can connect and build lifetime loyalty with our customers. Currently today we have about 4.3 million active members in the rewards program. Last year we added about 1 million. Clearly, we add and (26:47) as the years go on, so we're constantly looking to engage with new customers.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","And just on the number of those shopping in more than one channel?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't really have that number with me but if at some point we have it, we'll certainly share it with you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Swinand from Morningstar, Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Question on you're growing the online channel in a number of different ways from the different acquisitions to improving the old acquisitions and obviously (27:28) your own Rack brand, et cetera, but are you seeing any new or changed productivity in the way you're acquiring customers or the way you're marketing to customers? In other words should that get a more efficient marketing productivity over time or is it getting harder to acquire customers as the comparison gets tougher?","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","This is Erik. It changes constantly, how the different variables, many different variables in acquiring customers online (28:05) change year-to-year. They change month-to-month. So what the mix is between all those different variables, we're constantly changing. (28:16) search engines and market \u2013 search engine optimization that we go through. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily getting harder but I will say that the mix is constantly changing and so we have to change accordingly.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Could you maybe just give us some color on what you're currently seeing for strategies that are working?","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","No. We really don't get into that.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Okay.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","All right.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Best of luck. Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Just want to clarify the profitability outlook for Canada. It sounded to me that 2017 is probably the year when losses are going to start coming down. So I just want to make sure I'm correct in understanding that it sounds like this will be a year of higher losses and then again 2016 will also be a year of even higher. Would that be correct?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jeff, this is Mike. We expect 2015 and 2016 to be relatively comparable in terms of the losses and then after we open all the stores and start to get some scale we'll see that get better in 2017.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. So just from a very high level in terms of when you start harvesting the benefits of your capital program, it sounds like this is probably going to be kind of the trough year where you see the greatest pressure on earnings and next year will still continue to see pressure but you would see positive earnings growth year-on-year?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's currently what we're seeing today.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, everybody. Could you talk about the trends in women's sportswear and accessories what were the top performing categories? What's been disappointing? And then if you could comment, please, on your return rates? You know you're a few years into free shipping and free returns. Thanks.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Hi. This is Pete. In women's sportswear specifically where we've had the most success, which is largely kind of around what we would call our young customer segment, and the leading brand and initiative there is the Topshop performance, which has been really very, very good. And I think it was mentioned in the comments we're expanding from 50 stores to 80 this year. And then the existing stores were comping really well there. That's been a great catalyst for women's apparel in total.","I'd say the other category in women's apparel, there's really two that have been pretty good. Coats have been pretty good and dresses have been pretty solid. With the accessories, leading the way there has been our handbag business and then our jewelry business. Those have been probably the two categories that have been the best performing.","Barbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC","And returns? Thanks.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","Yeah, I'll take return rates. This is Erik. We've had free shipping, free returns on Nordstrom.com for three-and-a-half years now. So there really hasn't been any change since then. In off-price, we do charge, I think, for both of those. The important thing is the returns. Number one, returns is a big strategic subject for us. Being great for customers around returns is something that's long been part of our deal and that certainly includes online. For us, a big part of the value in our approach to returns is in having returns in the store. So online purchases being able to be return to our store, well over 60% of our Nordstrom.com returns end up at our full-line stores, well over 70% HauteLook and Nordstrom Rack returns end up at our Rack stores.","Last year at Rack stores, that drove, as Blake mentioned, an additional million visits to our Rack stores. So there is an absolute synergy. The returns part is probably the easiest, biggest synergy subject for us to talk about when we talk about the synergies between our stores and online. Again, return rates have been pretty stable at Nordstrom.com and what we're seeing more is the benefits of linking it to our stores.","Barbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, you guys did a lot to improve pricing transparency this year by kind of doing this we will not be undersold, and then also I guess by changing the sales pattern that you have. I guess, as you hindsight the year, did you get the kind of gross profit and sales return you would have liked out of those two initiatives? And then I guess as a follow-up, I think you mentioned that the new DC was to support free two-day shipping. So I guess when does that get put into place? Is there any other negative impact to the P&L from that? Thank you.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","This is Pete. Well I think with regards to the pricing, that was not intended to be a near-term lever to drive results, that's much more of a long-term value proposition with customers based on a desire to gain trust and loyalty and confidence over time and it's important for us to be transparent on that whole pricing subject. And with the way that online business has done now, the customers are way more enabled and they've got a lot of information and we've got be respectful of that, responsive to it. So that's just driven how we've adjusted some of our pricing velocity, most is still based in a bit of a reactionary thing.","We're trying to run a full-price business here. We have the natural rhythm cycles of markdowns that happen which gets addressed in our clearance strategy as you talked about going from those two (34:14) to that nearly to the six clearance events. But the promotional stuff is mostly just a reaction to what happens with some of the competition, that's leveled out a little bit here as the year has gone on and then where we are now and that things have moderated at least for now. I'm sorry, the second part of the question...","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","I can take that.","Peter E. Nordstrom - Director, Executive VP & President-Merchandising","Okay.","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","The new DC opening up, we haven't announced that we're going to free two-day shipping. The point was having an additional fulfillment center is it gets closer to a big chunk of customers. So about almost half of our customers are within a two-day ground delivery of that Pennsylvania fulfillment center. And so a big chunk of our orders for both customers will be one to three days faster for them than currently is. Now we will still ship some orders from our Cedar Rapids fulfillment center to the Northeast, we won't have a perfect allocation there but mainly we continue to focus on \u2013 and the long-term strategy here is to have a fulfillment network that gets practically all, at least over 90% of our customers in the United States within a two-day ground and this is one step in that direction.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And the last part of your question, this is Mike, you asked about the cost of this and in our comments we noted that there's an anticipated $30 million increase in expense, we haven't broken out the DC but that included both the DC and the loyalty program.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment you made. You mentioned that you expect earnings growth to reaccelerate after this sort of thrust of the investment program, it sounded like that reacceleration would happen around 2017. Is that a correct read on it? Or do you think it's more the 2018 timeframe? And then just a clarification on your Trunk Club comments, I think you mentioned that you were all quite impressed with how quickly the Trunk Club business model was able to get to breakeven. I think you mentioned that it delivered a $25 million loss in 2014 for Nordstrom and $30 million in 2015 is expected. Is that differential just a step-up from purchase accounting? Or is there something about acquiring Trunk Club that actually caused them to go from breakeven to a loss situation?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Kimberly. Thanks for your questions. On the first one, I think what we were saying is post-2015 we would start to see earnings growth improve. I don't think we used the word accelerate but we thought it would improve beginning after the peak year of 2015 investment. The second part on Trunk Club is we did indicate operating profitability at breakeven. And you're right. The losses are related to the amortization of the purchase accounting. So that's what contributes to that total $25 million that you mentioned.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Super helpful. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. $20 billion in sales by 2020 sounds pretty conservative to me but using your forecast, how should we think about the margin profile of that business? I think you finished this year around 15% EBITDAR, Mike. How should we think about the next few years, especially on the SG&A front?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, well, Paul it might sound conservative in the numbers but it's a heck of a lot of effort to get there. We think we have a pretty good plan and $20 billion is a good target for us. But, anyway, in terms of how we think about the profitability, I'd go back to what's been our longstanding guidance and that's been the high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens ROIC. It's very difficult to predict precise margins over shorter periods of time but our goal is to target those two numbers, and achieving them over that longer period should generate some pretty significant value.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Good afternoon. Can we dig a little bit more into the Trunk Club integration timeline? At this point, have you guys flipped the switch, the proverbial switch, wherever that is, with fulfilling Trunk Club orders through Cedar Rapids at this point? Or where are you in that progression? And is that contemplated in the 2015 dilutive impact? Thank you.","Erik B. Nordstrom - Director, President-Stores & Executive VP","Hi, Neely, this is Erik. No, to answer your question. We're not fulfilling Trunk Club orders out of Cedar Rapids at this point. They have a \u2013 they're doing that out of Chicago. What we're helping them with is really it's part of our supply chain network. While not in the physical location of Cedar Rapids, our team is supporting that. An easy, tangible example is we've got Trunk Club on our shipping contract with UPS, a significant savings with that. And as our long-term supply chain strategy is to have everything integrated. That includes our fulfillment centers, our DC, our stores, and long-term we've sort of looked for Trunk Club to be part of that. But in the short-term, they continue to be fulfilled out of Chicago.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Heather N. Balsky - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Heather Balsky on for Lorraine. Could you talk a little bit about your inventory plan going forward, especially for the Rack? How are you thinking about pack and hold investment? And then also just could you provide some color on how you're getting to the 300 store target for the Rack? What is that based on? Thanks.","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","Heather, this is Blake. Our pack and hold has been fairly consistent now over the last I'd say year and half or two years. It's about 11% of the total company's inventory, and so we continue through the vendor partnerships and relationships, have terrific access to product that closeout the end of the season that we're able to really pack and hold in the warehouse and use the following \u2013 you know, six months later. It helps us turn the corner in each of the existing stores and particularly is a key component for the new store growth. We mentioned that we opened 27 stores last year and 27 this year. Pack and hold enables us to execute that. So that's an approach with our vendor partnerships and vendor \u2013 our inventory maximizations that we're really pleased with and working well.","In terms of the 300 stores, it's a pretty fluid model, opening the Racks in terms of the lead-time, particularly compared to full-line stores, and we're just learning with each one and we continue to get great reception from the customer. I think it's really reflected in, and we've shared this before, on the productivity of the stores. They both maintain and enhance slightly with the addition of these new stores.","So we're encouraged by those opportunities. Sometimes there's some vagaries in the retail real estate market year-to-year but we feel very confident looking ahead between now and 2020. Given the criteria we use for new stores, the customer demand, the opportunities that are out there, that we feel very confident to publicly state that we should have bigger stores by 2020.","Heather N. Balsky - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I have a few follow-ups to earlier questions. I guess first, can you provide any update on the potential credit card sale and remind us on how you were thinking about capital allocation related to those proceeds? And then, as an unrelated follow-up. As you get to the 300 Rack store target, how are you thinking about the margin for this segment on an absolute basis? And any kind of directional basis you can give relative to the other channels? Thanks.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Steve, this is Mike. In terms of the credit card profit, as we indicated in our comments, we're very pleased with the progress to date. And we've learned a lot through this process and actually it's been more enlightening in terms of how we think we can better serve our customers going forward. So, we're excited about that.","Should we be successful, we would look at the proceeds the same way, through the same filters that we've always thought about capital allocation and that is first and foremost we always reinvest back in the business. That's where we get the highest returns and any excess capital that we have we'll return it to shareholders. And we're going to put any proceeds we might get through that identical lens.","In terms of the Rack, the Rack has and consistently operates with a four-wall operating margin consistent with the full-line stores. As we go through this accelerated phase, you have a little bit of a blip because you're recognizing brands on an accelerated basis before the store opens. But, as those new stores start to become a smaller piece of the pie, we should see that four-wall contribution start to get back to what is a more normal run rate.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck this year.","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Hi, Thanks for taking my question. You have a lot of moving pieces with Rack in the fourth quarter. So I have kind of a two part on Rack. As far as the gross margin, how much of that decline in the gross margin rate was unplanned versus liquidating inventory position that you built in the third quarter? And then the second part of that, as it played out at the register at Rack, I mean you likely had ASP compression I assume based on that markdown, but your comp was okay, it was actually better than the third quarter. Did you see a new customer come in or did the customer that was coming in the store otherwise just had a bigger basket as they saw the price decline?","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","Well Matt, this is Blake. We talked about in our last call that our inventories were high in the Racks, and so the team worked really hard and we're pleased that they were able to take that situation and get back in line and be current with our inventories today in one quarter. It did have, as you talked about \u2013 mentioned an impact on the margin. We had to accelerate some markdowns. We didn't see a material change in the average price, nor did we see any change, let's say per se, with our customer that \u2013 our diverse customer that shops with us. So, the actual execution of the business was very consistent.","Business did pick up. We don't talk about weather but when things got a little colder in November, things like outerwear got better and our Rack business got back to a trend that we'd been seeing prior. But the third quarter was a little softer. We think we're in a good position here as we start the new year, both at the Rack and all of our businesses when it comes to inventory. And so we're real fluid at this point.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. Our last question today comes from Joan Payson from Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the five-year capital plan and the Canada earnings expectations and whether those include the ultimate plan for Rack stores and an e-commerce launch or would those be incremental?","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry. The first part of the question was the capital plan and as it relates to the Canada earnings?","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So on a separate basis, basically, the new five-year capital plan and also the Canada earnings expectations, do those include Canada Rack and Canada e-commerce? Or would those...","Michael G. Koppel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Got it. Got it. Yes. Thank you for clarifying that. Those do include a placeholder for Canada Rack stores but do not include a placeholder for Canada e-commerce at this point.","Blake W. Nordstrom - President & Director","Just on Canada e-commerce, we do currently do quite a business online in Canada through our dot-com site. Our business picked up significantly with the opening of our store, especially around Calgary. We're seeing the reverse synergy. We've always had stores before we had a website. The first place where we had a website before we had a store and the store opening has lifted our business.","Trina Schurman - Director, Investor Relations, Nordstrom, Inc.","Again, thank you for joining today's call. A replay along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks will be available for one year on our website. Additionally, you'll find a summary of our performance and growth strategy at the end of the slide presentation. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
