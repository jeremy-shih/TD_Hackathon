My name is Amber, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Inc. Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O'Connell","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. For those of you participating in the webcast, please turn to Slide 2.","I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we are required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's press release, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 22, 2013, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining us on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Sabrina will come on the call in a few minutes and give you the details of the company's financial performance in the second quarter. Before we get to that, I've just got a couple of comments on Q2 and then I want to talk a little bit about the second half. And then, of course, you'll hear from Sabrina and we'll take all your questions.","On Q2, the company had very good sales results on a number of different fronts. We felt good about the comp at a plus-5%. That's a 2-year plus-9%, which is good performance. And it's the second quarter in which we have achieved an internal goal of comp-to-comp. So I think that that's good performance for Gap Inc. in the second quarter.","Now, unlike a lot of other retailers and brands, we continued to give monthly sales. We've been giving them in the 6 years that I've been here. We like it. We think it's transparent. That's not a commitment we're going to do forever and a day, but for now, what we think, that makes absolute sense. But I do want to say to everybody on the call that with the consumer environment we're dealing with and the changes in consumer behavior, there's always going to be lumpiness from one month to another. So I think I've said this before, but it's worth reiterating: we report our sales monthly, but we manage our business quarterly. So we come out of the quarter, regardless of how it may flow by month, we feel very good that the company achieved a 5% comp for the second quarter. That's very good performance.","I was also really happy with our total sales. Now we had an 8% reported total sales. But if you FX adjust that number, it's a plus-10%, which means Gap Inc. had about 5 points of spread between comp and total sales in the second quarter, which is also very good performance.","And lastly I want to highlight, like I did on Q1, our online business grew by 27%. Just coincidentally happens to be the same number as it was in Q1. It's also that very important channel where we're putting investments, where we believe we have a very strong share and we differentiate ourselves, had a nice growth rate in the second quarter.","Now just moving to the bottom line. It's nice to be able to leverage our business and set up an economic model, which you can do that with. So to got 160-basis-point improvement on our operating margin was nice to see. That gave us a 25% increase in profit and a 31% increase in earnings per share. So all-in-all, when you look at those numbers, I would say that Gap Inc. had a strong Q2.","Now I'd like to give all the analysts and investors updates on growth. I did that extensively in the first quarter call. Everything's on track when it comes to China, Athleta, our franchise business. Our growth initiatives continued to do well. What I do want to add, though, is that Old Navy is opening in Mainland China. It will be in Shanghai and it will open in the spring of 2014. Gap is opening in Taipei, which will be our first store in Taiwan, in the spring of 2014.","One thing I want to highlight in the second half, where there's noticeable change and some evolution that's taking place across all of our brands, and that's in the marketing area. That's in 2 fronts: it's in messaging and it's in the use of different mediums. From a messaging perspective, Old Navy, their creative platform, which they've been on for the better part of 2 or 3 years, is going to change. So Old Navy's positioning is absolutely consistent and is unique in the marketplace, which is delivering fashion essentials for the family. But after a couple of years, it's always good for you to reassess the platform and the voice of the brand. That's what the new team has done. And I feel very good about the second half on how we're going to continue to take this brand in the value sector and differentiate ourselves.","Banana Republic, if you've seen the Issa campaign that is out right now and the collaboration we have, I think that's brand-new creative. And that's the look and the feel that all of our customers are going to see in the back half. And I think it just needed -- it needed a change. It needed to be freshened up. It needed to look a little more relevant. So I think that's what you're seeing on the Issa creative execution and you'll see that kind of execution, that kind of look and feel, in the rest of the back half.","And lastly, Athleta, which has been a very strong success for the business and we love the marketing behind it, which is Power to the She, and that's what the brand platform is and that's not changing. But it's going to evolve its look a little bit. We want the brand to be a little broader. And you're going to see some of that more around the holiday season. On the medium front, I have 2 things to report. One, that Gap is going back to television in the fall. Many times over the last 4 or 5 years, we've been asked if Gap would go back on television. I understand the question because of the heritage and the association with Gap brand and great TV commercials. I think the criteria for me has been pretty consistent. What's the strategy behind it? Do we feel the messaging is strong and unique? Do we believe the product is absolutely the right product in our stores in order to go out and spend the money on television, bring new people in? So Gap brand has been able to check off all those boxes. So you will see Gap brand go back to television this fall. Don't ask me about holiday, I'll just try to get ahead of the question, I don't know the answer yet. Again, we got to go through the criteria and make sure everything's right. And if everything's right, then we will consider television for holiday. But that has not been decided yet. And the other thing I want to mention is that we are really making a further shift in the back half of 2013 to try to acquire more new customers.","For the last couple of years, I think a lot of our investment, the mediums we've used, have been to strengthen our strengths with existing customers, at the same time as trying to speak to our lapsed customers. Now there's always marketing. If you put money in your windows, you're always talking to some new customers, but it's been mostly broadcast, broadcast media. And I think that the business now, with so many more tools and so many more choices for a company like us, you're going to see us put more money towards person casting and really try to speak to specific group of customers that we believe should be experiencing the brand and should be in our stores and should be on our online site. And that's across all 6 of our brands. So definitely, that's going to be a focus on the second half because it's important for a business like ours, in order to continue to move the business forward, to have the right balance on loyal customers, lapsed customers and new customers.","Let me close this portion of the call off by saying that all of our product for fall and holiday is bought. From my perspective, our design and merchandising teams have done a very good job. Like any business, you learn from the previous year. You have to make adjustments, you have to make sure that you're putting the focus and the energy behind where you can dominate. That's why for years, we've been talking about a comp is an outcome. That's why each one of our brands, as they build up their assortment, they know what categories they're going to dominate on, where they're going to differentiate themselves. And that's where the focus is. And look, we've been doing this for years. I just think this year, coming into fall and holiday, is just another year where the team has moved the needle forward. So I like what the design and merchandising teams have done. And now it's over to execution. So it's over to our marketers, I talked about earlier; our inventory management team; our store leaders; our online teams, to really make sure they take the product that's been designed and execute it to the highest level possible. To do what? Well, of course, to win. To win more and more customers and to gain market share. That's the business we're in. I think we've done that in the first half of this year. If you look in -- the first half was a market share gaining first half. And it's certainly our goal, sitting here today, to replicate market share gains in the second half.","With that said, let me pass the call over to Sabrina and then I'll answer any of your questions after she's finished with her comments. Thank you.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance as we again met our goals, which include growing sales with healthy merchandise margins, leveraging expenses, expanding operating margin and growing earnings per share.","Please turn to Slide 3 for our earnings recap. Our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64 versus $0.49 last year. Here are some additional Q2 highlights. Net sales were up 8% with comparable sales up 5%. Gross margin expanded by 60 basis points to 40.5%. Operating margin expanded by 160 basis points to 13.5%. Net earnings were up $60 million or 25%. And with S&P's upgrade of our credit rating earlier in the quarter, we are now an investment grade credit with all 3 major agencies.","Turning to Slide 4, sales performance. Second quarter total sales were $3.9 billion. The translation of foreign revenues into dollars impacted our reported net sales. For the second quarter, our net sales were negatively impacted by about $56 million primarily due to the weakening of the yen. On a constant currency basis, our revenues were up 10%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Turning to Slide 5, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 10% to $1.6 billion and gross margin was up 60 basis points to 40.5%. Our merchandise margins were down 30 basis points and rent and occupancy leveraged 90 basis points.","Please turn to Slide 6 for operating expenses. Second quarter total operating expenses were $1 billion, up $44 million from the prior year. Marketing expenses were up $1 million to last year at $148 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses leveraged by 100 basis points. Delivering on our goals of sales growth and expense leverage resulted in net earnings of $303 million, up 25% to last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet on Slide 7. Inventory dollars per store were up 6%, broadly in line with our comp sales growth. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow of $542 million and we ended the second quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash. During the quarter, we distributed $97 million through share repurchases and dividends. Our quarter end share count was 468 million. There were share repurchases within the quarter were relatively modest, we're pleased to announce our intention to increase our dividend beginning in Q3 from $0.60 to $0.80 per share annually. This represents a 60% increase over 2012's dividend of $0.50 per share.","Please turn to Slide 8 for capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $315 million. With regard to company-operated stores, we ended the quarter with 3,106 stores. Square footage was flat to the second quarter 2012. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.","And now, I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 9. Given our progress in the first half of the year, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share from $2.52 to $2.60, to $2.57 to $2.65. At the midpoint, this implies a growth rate of 12% for the year. However, as we've called out, given the 53rd week in 2012, the cadence of quarterly earnings growth is uneven with growth weighted towards the first half of the year. There are 2 important considerations for the remainder of the year. First, foreign exchange; and second, last year's 53rd week in the resulting calendar shift this year.","Beginning with foreign exchange. Our full year earnings guidance contemplates some of the impact of foreign currency headwinds, specifically the yen, which is depreciated by about 20%. This depreciation negatively impacts our reported sales and earnings. For example, our first half sales were negatively impacted by over $100 million. To be helpful, we reported sales in the Asia region last year of about $1.3 billion. The vast majority of which were yen-based. Simply applying the 20% depreciation to this amount would equate to a meaningful headwind to revenue of over $250 million for the full year.","Now turning to the calendar impact. As we've noted several times, the fourth quarter this year has 1 less selling week in the fourth quarter last year. Additionally, the week that's dropped from the fourth quarter is a large selling week. Therefore, just as the first quarter benefited from the calendar shift, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by an amount that is larger than the benefit we saw in Q1, given the volume of sales for holiday is larger than the volume during the spring. Keep in mind that both foreign exchange and the calendar shift impact the spread between total sales growth and comps sales. Given these impacts, we expect spread for the full year of about 1 percentage point. Because the spread between total sales growth and comp sales in the first half was 4 percentage points, we, therefore, expect the spread in the back half to be far less than the first half. Aside from these 2 important callouts, the following guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged: operating margin, about 13%; square footage, up about 1%; regarding company-operated stores net of repositions, we plan to open about 160 and close about 80; store openings are weighted towards Gap China, Old Navy Japan, Athleta and Global outlets, while store closures are weighted towards Gap North America. We expect capital expenditures to be about $675 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 39%. We expect Q3 inventory dollars per store to be up in the mid-single-digits.","In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategies during the first half of the year. And of course, we're now focused on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","Thank you, Sabrina. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Glenn, the entire team has done just such a terrific job in what appears to be very intense and competitive retail environment. I don't know if you've had a chance to sort of step back and just look at what's going on in your business relative to everyone else. But could you just touch on some of the key operational and executional improvements that you guys have implemented over the last 1 or 2 years to stabilize and improve the performance? And are you seeing any kind of encouraging signs in the traffic trends in your stores that's sort of potentially helping the comp trend?","Glenn K. Murphy","Let me start with the first question. We -- I'd say what we've been doing for the last 3 or 4 years is to balance out the company's portfolio. So when the new management team started together, one of the comments that I think we made internally and possibly externally, is we got hand -- we've taken over a very nice hand. We've just got to make sure we play it right now. Having a big business in the value sectors, that's important. That's Old Navy. And we have a brand in the value sectors, that's a great opportunity. And the point of differentiation for us, obviously, Gap, iconic, more mid-market. Banana Republic, a little more of, let's call it affordable luxury, versatility and in -- what I would call versatile work. So again, all 3 brands being different from one another. One of the things I've tried to do since I've been here is make sure that while there's always a little bit of internal dynamic tension between the brands -- and let's face it, apparel is only so big, so there's going to be a little bit where they intersect in certain categories. We try to make sure there's enough differentiation between the brands. I think that helps us. And then, as you know, for the last number of years we've been pushing our online business, putting investments behind that because we know that's the future. And we've always had a great platform. We're just building in that platform and evidence of that is another great quarter of a 27% growth. And that's good, not only for where the customer is, but it's great for return on capital, great for return on sales. And simultaneously, we've been pushing the outlet business. So a good opportunity, where 2 of our brands, where they're established brands, but there's a value derivative of those brands. We've put a lot of money and a lot of square footage has shifted into that business. And lastly, as we've gained confidence and made investments in our international markets driven by our franchise business, which is contributing nicely, it still has a long way to go in terms of its size, a lot more Banana Republics, a lot more Gaps in countries we're already in. Next year will be Old Navy's chance to go into franchise markets. And that's also a business that has a very nice return on sales, return on capital. So I think the biggest thing we've done is to balance out the portfolio. Now although they're not significant contributors to this particular quarter, then you have a new brand play between Athleta, Intermix and Piperlime. So I think one of our advantages, some people choose to have a singular brand and that's where they focus and that may make sense for them; for us, given how fragmented the apparel business is, where the leading market share player could have something like a mid- to high single-digit going -- coming to the market with different brands and unique brands and multiple brands into different channels and into different geographies, obviously, as we execute, and we have a long, long way to go, is paying off as evidenced by this quarter. Now traffic, I think we've been stating on our monthly calls that traffic has been slightly negative. Maybe some people reporting in this quarter had traffic that was maybe better than that. It certainly seems like some had traffic that was worse than that. We would love to be able to continue to find the innovative and creative solutions that could get us the positive traffic. That's certainly not a goal we're giving up on because our view is that somebody's always delivering a positive comp, somebody's always delivering positive traffic. That's how we have to believe it, that in spite of our slightly negative traffic from -- in the first and second quarter, that we strongly believe there's positive traffic to be had. But then you holistically, when you add that up with our online business and put it together, it's a different picture. So we're finding a way to drive UPTs, to drive conversion, to drive average transaction in this environment, where in spite of the innovative and creative marketing we may be putting into place, we're seeing slightly negative traffic. But we're not giving up on that. We have great real estate because we've been around a long time. We've been repositioning our real estate over the last 5 years, so there's no excuse on the quality of the real estate of the business and we've certainly put capital into our stores. So now it's up to the marketers and the store operators to turn that investment into positive traffic.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sabrina, I just wanted to follow up on the decline in merchandise margin this quarter. What were the drivers and what's your outlook for the rest of the year?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, so the merchandise margin was down very slightly. Fortunately, as we've been calling out, that a big driver to our gross margin opportunities going forward is going to be in rent and occupancy. So very much as we'd expect, Lorraine, we're driving that expansion through rent and occupancy leverage on the positive comp. We said that past Q1, we were not going to have any AUC tailwinds any longer and we just wanted to deliver our merchandise margins and our comp -- or our comp with healthy merchandise margins. We feel like in this environment, we very much achieved that in Q2. And so we'll always be looking to do well on the merchandise margin line, but a lot of our opportunity lies in the continuation of rent and occupancy leverage on a positive comp.","Operator","Going next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping -- Glenn, on the last conference call, I think you talked about feeling better vibes from the consumer in a sense that things were starting to pick up. I was curious if you still have the same point of view and whether you can give us a sense on how August started and back-to-school started at this point.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I think you know us well enough that we're not going to comment on August. And when it comes to back-to-school, it's obviously a moment in time, but it's not a holiday for our portfolio of brands that may be for other retailers that you cover. Old Navy is really the only brand that participates in back-to-school. So while it's important and we certainly want to go out and gain market share and use it as a way to bring new customers into our stores, it's not something we're as dependent on as others. In terms of the customer, my views haven't changed. That all I can do is look at it from a high-level and go, it seems that there are a positive signs on employment in this country and in some other countries because we're global player. It seems like certain wealth creation, whether it's in people's equity in their homes or whether it's people who may be fortunate enough to be in certain stock markets that that's creating wealth beyond was -- people would have had in 2012. And other -- like anybody, we're doing our research, we're talking to customers all day long, we're trying to manage people's -- trying to understand people's expectation and where customer sentiment is. But as I tried to say in the opening comments, we figured out as a management team in 2008 that we were dealing with a new paradigm that somebody coined back then as the new normal. And in the new normal, it's not uncommon for customers, for very little reason or any reason, to go into hibernation. Whether that's for a month or whether that's for a quarter, that's just something that we become acclimatized to. And our team, as what I said earlier to the question that Kimberly posed, I look at it this way, that even if there was a period of time in 2009 or 2012 where for reasons that are out of our control that customers may go into a period of hibernation, our view is somebody is always winning. And somebody is always positive comping, positive traffic comping, gaining market share. So our position to our team and one that I know Sabrina and I embrace, is that should be us. And what are we doing in spite of a period that customers may be in another category or delaying purchases, whatever they may choose to do because of this new paradigm we operate in, we still have to look at and go, there's business to be had, there is traffic to be taken, there's market share to be gained. And that's the attitude we have to take, so we're used to it. Would I prefer it was like 2007? Sure. Would I prefer things were like the 1990s? Part of the 1990s were also attractive as a retailer. This is the customer we have. So our attitude is let's just make the best of it and let's do like we did in Q2, which is get a 5% comp, get total sales of 10% and have a quarter that produced the kind of leverage that we had and let's go out and gain market share. We have a good portfolio of brands. There's no reason that shouldn't be us.","Operator","We'll go next to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Sabrina, I wondered about your comments with respect to gross margin and [indiscernible]? I was wondering if that implied that you were less optimistic about full-priced selling opportunity in the second half of the year. And Glenn, I wondered if you would talk about the denim category. You've invested in it in a major way at both Gap and Old Navy. A lot of people are talking about the comparison to colored denim from last year. And I'm wondering if you think that could be a challenge this year.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Janet, I will start with the first part of your question and my comment to Lorraine's question was in no way meant to imply that we had changed our outlook on reg selling. In fact, in the second quarter, we improved in terms of how much we sold at reg and promo. So we sold less at markdown, more at reg and promo. So we're on a really good path with good momentum there. I think our opportunity really lies in continuing to be quite surgical about our promotion and making sure that we are getting the highest yield we can and not giving away too much, as we do what our customers value and want, which is some promotional activity, but continuing to manage those really well. But we did very well on the reg selling bucket. And of course, that remains an opportunity, but I think we have some good momentum there.","Glenn K. Murphy","And then as far as denim is concerned, it's a dominate category for both Gap and for Old Navy. And we're not -- we would never abandon color. It's part of the DNA of both brands, maybe a little bit more in Gap than it is in Old Navy. You're still going to see color. There's color still in our stores this fall. There'll still be colored denim in our stores in holiday. Is it less pronounced? It's less pronounced. I mean, I think our view is that trying to climb the mountain a second year in a row when a lot of people came in last year who bought a lot of colored denim from us, I think that there's still opportunity to sell more to them in the next 6 months. But the move we have made in either the marketing campaign for Gap of Back to Blue or the current marketing campaign for Old Navy, is we believe in going back to indigo with different treatments. Some cases it's coated denim, grays are very big for us. So we're really pleased with the business we're doing in that category. So between Gap Outlet and Old Navy and Gap, I think we've made some really good decisions to not move away from color but to maybe marginalize them a little bit versus what we had last year in the back half and then add something new and fresh and try to make sure, not only do we have the right different kinds of indigo interpretation, but we have an amazing fit that the inventory has done right and then we count on people online and in the stores and our marketing team to tell that story. And so we're pleased with how the marketing looks. We're certainly pleased with how the denim is showing up in the store. And this is not just 1 month, this is -- what you see now is the foundational shift that we believe we had to make that you'll see in our stores. Not -- of course there'll be new product coming in, but foundationally, the shift you're seeing is going to last us from now until the holiday.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Glenn, I thought it was interesting, the comment you talked about going after a new customer profile for all of the brands. And I was just wondering if you can elaborate that and maybe give us some more color on what is the profile of the new customer versus your existing customer? And what were some of the limitations that prevented you from, perhaps, going after this customer before?","Glenn K. Murphy","Yes, maybe in my opening comments I may have misspoken. What -- the message was that the customer profile has not changed whatsoever. And neither has the positioning of the brands or in many cases the platform or the marketing. Our view is that, if you just use Old Navy for a second and say that we have a customer profile who's a targeted customer, we understand that customer, who she is, who he is, what their families are. In a business like Old Navy is you just target that customer exactly as a percentage of customers that are available for every x percent of customers, we may only have 5% or 10% of them. And within that group, we look at it and go how are we holding on to our loyal customers, which I think disproportionately that's been our obsession coming out of 2008, 2009, back to a -- I feel like I'm a historian today, back to giving you a history lesson, but coming out of that period of time, we really focused on holding on to the customers we had. And then the last year, maybe 18 months, you've seen some of the investments and some of the mediums we've been using to make sure that we can address lapsed customers. And this is where big data is important because now we can look at information and look at tendencies of customers who are loyal and what makes them lapsed and try to get to them and speak to them and incent them, in some cases, before they become a lapsed customer, to stay loyal with us. It's all the same about new customers, Matt, is there's a lot of customers in our targeted profile who really, believe it or not, either have not tried us and have not come into our stores, whether it's online or into our stores, or they were with us a number of years ago and with the changes we've made to our assortment, to our product, especially Gap and Old Navy, that we need to go out and speak to them. And there's so many more tools now and so many more ways to target a specific group of new customers to get them to experience your brand that were not available to us 5 years ago. And that's where we put a lot of money in the last 5 years, is not only in understanding customer files but trying to actually get bigger files that can talk to similar profiles, but actually -- because these are customers who have no history with us, let's say in the last 2 to 3 years. So that is, to me, a missed opportunity and our marketing teams and our brand presidents know that. The last thing you want to do is to gain a lot of share in a big holiday like July 4th and go out and have the right product, the right messaging and gain share and on the very next day after a big holiday, I go and talk to the exact same customers. I mean, they've been into your store, they've gone online now. You're not going to get people to unnaturally frequent a brand. So share of wallet is important, but we've got to get to new customers. And I think what you're going to see in the back half is no incremental marketing necessarily, but a shift in some of the marketing to speak to new customers. And that's one of the reasons Gap is going back on television.","Operator","We'll go next to Betty Chen with Wedbush Securities.","Betty Y. Chen - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Sabrina, the SG&A number leveraged very nicely in the second quarter. Can you remind us of some of the opportunities or is it mainly coming from the leverage on the top line. And whether some of those opportunities can continue into the back half and how we should think about that line item?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. We did do very nicely on SG&A and we continue to be very disciplined on that line item. I would say the 2 primary drivers helping us in the quarter was all of our store-related expenses did very nicely and were well managed by the teams and leveraged nicely. And then as well, lacking last year's big investment in marketing, where we're sort of on a nominal dollar basis, you can see holding those marketing dollars being up only 1 million, that's providing some nice leverage as well. So those are probably the 2 biggest buckets. As Glenn sort of alluded to, in the back half, we'll continue to be disciplined. Certainly marketing, because we invested so much last year, we certainly don't intend to divest, but we're probably not going to increase those investments a lot. So they should continue to leverage. The only thing I'll call out, of course, is that in the fourth quarter because of that lack of a 53rd week, of course, leveraging is going to be different in the fourth quarter than it is in the other quarters.","Operator","We'll go next to John Morris of Bank of Montr\u00e9al Capital.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Glenn, I think a question for you about one of the initiatives that I think went live last quarter, the Reserve in Store initiative. How's that going? What are you seeing from it? What kind of benefits are impacting the business maybe in terms of Citrix, thinking about the UPT, et cetera?","Glenn K. Murphy","You're right. We launched it about 8 weeks ago. It's in a total of 40 stores divided into 2 cities and into 2 brands. So that's in Chicago and San Francisco and it's Gap brand and Banana Republic. And just to take a step back, it's just -- it's another -- it's another point along the journey for us when it comes to omni-channel. So we were early into ship-from-store, which is more than a year old. We then, obviously, this is all about dealing with the customer first, we then realized the ship-from-store was helpful. We then realized the power of find-in-store, which is making sure a customer, before they make that first decision to start a journey, you can go on our site, hit the FIND IN STORE button on a particular product and find out the availability of that product within a store within 25 miles of where they currently are. That's a tool I think we still need to invest in and educate people on. But we know one of the biggest challenges everybody in retail faces, maybe a little more pronounced in apparel than maybe if you're in a drugstore business, is when they see something that you can get them excited about, whether it's through the marketing you're doing out of home or in magazines or windows in your store or something online, of course, on your smartphone, is will it be available? I mean, think about that when a new collection launches or something like a collaboration with Issa, trying to find out if it's available is -- that's that battle that customers have with themselves because that's the nature of this industry. It could be gone very quickly. So find-in-store is very important. Find-in-store then gave birth to reserve-in-store. So to answer your question, John, just to give you a little bit of the path we've been on, we've been really happy with it. It's unique. It's different than pickup-in-store and I think that we're learning a lot of lessons, but in the -- we've learnt lot of lessons in the last 8 weeks. The one I can share with you that's most interesting to me and there's a dozen little anecdotes like this, but the percentage of people who are reserving in off-hours has been really interesting to me. And I didn't see that coming. I knew that would be a feature we could talk about, but just imagine now that basically the marketing message coming forward. Because part of the test is to inform us, as we roll this out to more markets in the fall, is how exactly do you position us? Why would I want to reserve something in-store? But with the crazy world we all live in and the hours people have to put forward with their business life, their personal life, the ability to go on at 10:00 or 11:00 or 6:00 in the morning and see something that really is something you want and to reserve it and then be able to get a text from us when the store opens, I think that's proven to be a much bigger draw than I thought it was going to be. So I think as we roll this out, that could be part of the marketing. As it -- basically, our store is always open. You can always find out from us. And so place a reservation and first thing in the morning, our team fulfills that. So it's -- that's one of the lessons, one of many lessons that you'll see us apply as we make the decision to roll this out further in the fall to more than just 2 cities.","Operator","We'll go next to Dorothy Lakner with Topeka capital markets.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe tagging onto that last question, Glenn, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the split between e-commerce and stores or the lack thereof. There has been a lot of talk, I think, on other calls where perhaps results have been weaker about online-only retailers taking market share and how many stores are you going to close and -- kind of the conversation moving towards is the stores business going away. And clearly, you're ahead of the pack anyway because you closed so many stores over the last decade, you really cleaned up the stores portfolio. So how are you feeling now about the omni-channel business and the power of having stores versus -- or with the online capability that you have as well?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, just one point before. We've only started closing stores 5 years ago. We probably shouldn't have opened stores in the first 5 years of the decade you're referring to, but the store closure program really started in 2008. We'll have it completed by the end of this year. Well, we've said publicly, there's always going to be maintenance closures you're going to do or repositions. If you have a big fleet -- you heard Sabrina talk earlier, just under 3,200 stores -- a big fleet like that, there's going to be more than onesie and twosie. But you're right. We got ahead of the pack because that was one of our strategic initiatives in 2007. I don't know. I don't -- we're -- we see that in a completely different way. I may be wrong with this number but if nothing else, it's directionally correct. In the last quarter, I think Amazon's number, who are peer play, were up 22%. And we've been up 27% the last 2 quarters. So our view is that these -- I think it all depends on people's definition of the omni-channel. For us, the omni-channel definition is that the world becomes seamless and that it's totally transparent. It's all about serving the customers. So if a customer, to John's question, is in Chicago and wants to reserve something 11:00 at night and get a text from our team at 9:05 after we open at 9:00, saying it's here, Dorothy, and it's waiting for you and we're going to hold it here for 24 hours, that makes the store incredibly valuable. The other thing I want to mention to you that -- it's a stat I gave out recently, is in spite of the fact that more and more customers are experiencing our brand online first, that number should hit about 50% this year, where the smartphone, your tablet is the first place you go to experience the brand, the one number that has not changed is that -- and we -- this is 6 years running now, 80% of our customers actually want to go try on the product in a store. And even though the smartphone, tablet and they're experiencing virtually an online of the brand and being able to lose yourself and do your own discovery and shopping online and that's why investments online are very important, the store matters in our category. So what better advantage do we have than to build a transparent, seamless environment. As I mentioned to John, we started with ship-in-store, find-in-store, reserve-in-store and as I'll talk more in September as I attend a conference in New York, is about the ability now to personalize that experience and be very cognizant of the power of a physical bricks-and-mortar location and an offline and bringing those 2 together, I think that's who's going to win in the long term, those who can do that in our category.","Sabrina L. Simmons","And just to underscore Glenn's point, Dorothy, when we report comp, we said that online generally contributes about 2 points of the comp. So with our 5 comp in the quarter, certainly, you can see that our store's underlying has a very healthy comp.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Sabrina, first, a quick clarification. Did I understand this correctly, did you say that the impact of the calendar shift on fourth quarter EPS would be greater than the $0.08 benefit that you saw in the first quarter? And then my question is how much fabric or what percent of fabric are you currently platforming and how much has that increased this year and how much more room do you have to go with that?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Great. So yes, you listened really well, Jennifer, as usual. So that's exactly right, that the negative impact to the fourth quarter is larger than the $0.08 that the first quarter benefited from. And then I'll let Glenn take the fabric platforming.","Glenn K. Murphy","Haven't had a chance yet today to use our analogy with innings, but I would say that on a fabric platforming, the benefit of that will really be felt in the first quarter of 2014. But we likely came from an environment where -- earlier this year, we're probably in the second inning, we get into the second half in the third inning and I think we'll catapult ourselves to the sixth or seventh inning in the first half of 2014. And then the target we have, what percent of our total business will be fabric in a -- in a fabric platform environment into a toolbox. And part of this started with fabric reductions and eliminations and consolidation. That was very important. Once you get that done, and that's the work that's been going on for the last 6 months, then you get into a platformed environment. So will be a little bit of progress in the back half of this year, but we'll have it all done by the second half of 2014.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One for Glenn and maybe one for Sabrina. I guess, Glenn, as you hindsight with Stefan on the Old Navy business for the first half, just curious from a category or execution perspective, what were you most happy with and where do you still think Old Navy has the biggest opportunities as you guys work together? And then maybe for Sabrina, it looked like you only bought back, I think, $27 million worth of stock in the quarter and you didn't raise the dividend after the close. So just curious, should we be thinking about you're going to be increasing the dividend faster than you buy back stock or just any thoughts on the capital allocation.","Glenn K. Murphy","On Stefan, what I can say about him, is that he's harder on himself than I am on him. Look, a lot of this -- a lot of the impact, Brian, that Stefan is making on the business will more be felt in the back half. Just in fairness to him, he started in October of last year. So we didn't have him necessarily jump right into the business day 1, so his biggest impact is yet to come. But I would say building a great team, which he's done, which is 75%, 80% of the people are in the company already, but putting the team together, getting everybody very focused has been very important. The fact that he really believes and loves what this brand stands for, because sometimes you bring new people in, in spite of how you may interview them and what they may say, you get them in the seat for 30, 60, 90 days -- and some people may have different opinions, I love the fact that he's been consistent since the first day he's here of what this brand stands for. Now he's evolved it. He's polished it up. But I think he's got really good clarity in the business about what's important for him and how Old Navy is going to go out and win. And you can't debate the fact that he's had a pretty good execution with the product that he inherited, which was good product. I mean, the team before him did a very nice job. But you still have to have somebody who has to take that, as I said earlier in my earlier opening comments about the second half of this year, you still have to have somebody who stewards that through. And first -- second quarter comp of 6% is good performance. So I think that that's where he probably had his first initial commercial impact on the business. So I think that's very good. And he found the right balance. I like the fact that he didn't unnecessarily chase any given month. As I said, people look at our business internally. We obviously have a long, long view that Sabrina and I have, which is measured in years. But our brand presidents look at their business on any given quarter. So he didn't unnecessarily chase 1 month versus another; he did make the right decision and he produced a very good quarter. So I'm -- with that all said, I'm excited about the second half for him because he's view of Old Navy, his view of fashion and apparel, his view of how he's going to bring that brand and continue to build on it and build on it and win, I think some of that will be felt in the second half.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. And then with regard to -- I'll call it cash distributions, broadly. Our -- many of our philosophy has really changed, Brian. So we're big believers in distributing our excess cash to shareholders and we will continue to use both the dividend as well as continued share repurchases. With regard to share repurchases, the stocks actually just moved up and we're pleased with that quite a bit year-to-date and even within the quarter. And we tend to be opportunistic. So we just haven't caught that wave at the right moment. But there's been plenty in years where we do a lot, if not the majority, of our share repurchasing in the second half. So we're still very open to that program and we look forward to continuing it. The dividend increase, really, is about underscoring our commitment on the dividend side as well. We -- we stepped up the dividend in a meaningful way at the beginning of the year. But truly, probably increased it at a more conservative end of the payout range we like to be at. So we were at 25% with the $0.60 dividend per share. And part of that is when we increased the dividend at the been very beginning of the year, we were contending with more uncertainty with regard to the tax rates just being lifted on capital gains and dividends and the fiscal cliff situation, the debt ceiling situation. So with more clarity on that, we felt really comfortable stepping up the dividend to the higher end of the payout range that we like to be in.","Operator","We'll go next to Oliver Chen with Citi.","Nancy Hilliker","This is Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. My -- I have one question related to just product. In terms of athletic apparel within the different brands, Gap, Old Navy and at Athleta, can you give us an update on how Athleta is performing? It seems to be a popular category this season. And also, if you could just give us a little bit more information on updates with Intermix and Athleta and performance there, in particular.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, what I would say is athletic, women's athletic apparel has been popular for many seasons. And it's the reason that, not only that we decide to make a decision to acquire Athleta, but also to boost our presence in that category by really introducing GapFit into the Gap business. And you can see the active product and the active brand you see at Old Navy. So our view is that this is not cyclical. That you have a long-term opportunity where women in general are looking at different combinations of occasions and outfits and it's -- you don't have to walk too many malls or too many schools or see people on weekends, that there's -- it would be a little bold of me to call it the new denim. But there is something about the occasion of wearing something that's very fitted, that you're comfortable in, that's casual, that can also look good. I think that we've covered the bases because similar to denim, you have different people buying at different price points. You have Old Navy, who have their active bottoms, which again are doing extremely well at $29. You have Gap with GapFit at $49. And you have Athleta around the $79 price point. So to us, as the category continues to grow, if it is like denim, then we are really well positioned on -- really, where the majority of the business is going to be done are going to be in those 3 price points. As long as the people who run those business continue to differentiate them, put the right technical properties into them, make sure that the fit is phenomenal and consistent, then you can have fun with it. After all, were in the fashion business unlike other companies. So when it comes to color and print and patterns, that's something that comes naturally to our teams. So I think that we're really well positioned in that business. Intermix, again, we're just very happy. It's early days. And we'll open a few new stores this year. I think the team is doing a good job in New York. And I think Art Peck that's leading it is really trying to think about the business strategically. But we're really happy with the brand and it just gives us a chance to get, not only the learning we're going to benefit from in Gap Inc., but a chance to provide some of the advantages Intermix would never have on their own. So if you think of what we're really good at, we're really good at the online business at nowhere of importance. We're really good online. That's something that can really help Intermix business. We understand real estate and fleet management. That's something that we can really help Intermix with. And the list goes on and on and on about how do we combine our competitive advantage and our strength to this really good brand and gain share in the luxury business, which is not something our portfolio had the opportunity to do before we acquired it. So, so far so good and more to come.","Operator","We will take our final question from Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess the question is on marketing. And I guess this is a question for both Glenn and Sabrina. Glenn, the idea to go back to TV for the first time in 4 years, can you talk about what the rationale was and how you thought about that from an ROI perspective. And then, I guess, Sabrina, when we think of -- your advertising dollars have been roughly low-single digits in the first half of the year. Because you're going back to TV in terms of how much that costs, I mean, how should we kind of expect that for Q3 and the back half, if you could give any guidance.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Well, I'll just start sort of from a financial perspective. We feel really good about the investments we're making in marketing. And even though our traffic is still slightly negative, it has been improving from Q1 into Q2. With regard to the television, I will tell you that the team has just done an excellent job of being really efficient with that spend. Because unlike the last time we were on television, which was holiday '09, when we used to invest quite a bit of dollars to do national network TV, we're no longer pursuing television in that fashion. So it's going to be much, much more focused and surgical on our top market and buying spot TV, which I think these days especially is just much, much more efficient than the old national network. So that's how we're keeping the dollars well in hand. And we think it's a solid investment. I'll turn it over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","And I mentioned in the opening comments that there's different gates that -- not just Gap, we're not picking on them -- but if anybody wants to shift their investment in any kind of significant way, again, the investment increase is not going to happen, but moving the money around and experimenting with new mediums, we tend to get involved on those conversations. Gap very effectively crossed all the gates, I talked about in my opening comments. The big thing for me is television is to be repetitive as the medium, but what I like is the content that the team is putting together that can be used in social, it can be used on our online site, it can be used in cinema, it can be used on television. So the content is what's important. And our CMO for Gap, who is super talented, working with Stephen Sunnucks and the team, has come up with some great content. Now within the framework of how much money they have to spend, which even in short -- in 4 short years between 2009 and today, the options for that team are multiples more than they would have had in 2009, where television was probably 90% of the use of expense on the content we develop. I'm not going to give the number but it's a number much, much less and you're much less dependent on. Although it's still a very important medium, you're much less dependent on it. So I think the knock-on effect of television and all the other levers that the team is going to use is going to be great. I think the creative was well thought through. I think it's very Gap-appropriate. I think it's in a season we've got something to talk about, which is Back to Blue, back to our heritage, what we stand for, how we want to differentiate ourselves. So I feel good about what they're doing. And as I said, whether this produces another use of that medium -- we're going to produce content for holiday, whether we use television medium is to be determined, but we're going to have content. That's how I'll leave it with you.","Katrina O'Connell","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.

Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. As has been customary in the last number of calls, I'm going to provide some color on the performance in the second quarter and then I'm going to hand over to Sabrina, who will take you through a much more detailed review financially.","Now the second quarter, there was a lot of bright spots inside the business that we feel good about. There's been a lot of effort, a lot of energy being directed to get us to where we are today. So I think the best thing for me to do is maybe take you through some of those bright spots and give you my sense of what we're doing and to give you a little more information behind the P&L.","So let's start with sales, which was very positive in the second quarter. We had a 4% comp, and that was made up by our 3 North American brands: a 7% comp in Gap North America, 7% Banana Republic and a 3% comp at Old Navy. And that's the second quarter in a row where the disbursement of our comp was very much driven almost equally across all 3 of the brands. That's very positive. When that happens, our business does very well, as you can see by the $0.49 earnings per share the company accomplished.","Now there are a number of reasons why our business has been consistently positive for the first half of this year. The number one reason is product, and where there's been a lot of focus, a lot of effort starting late last year with our product teams. I'm really proud of the work they've done in the first half, whether that's on the right styles, which, obviously, we've had great success with so far, particularly in the second quarter. The color trend has been good for the industry, but we've capitalized on it. I think we've really focused on fit and consistency of fit, and our scores on that front are improving into the second quarter. And lastly, we've made these targeted investments in key categories, categories where we want to dominate, where we want to win. And those are our product assets. And we\u2019ve put the money behind those assets. And our customers are noticing it.","Second thing when it comes to sales is, I think we're flowing our product in a much more seasonally correct way. One thing that I've always been frustrated about is that July and January, in particular, have never been our best months. I think the teams are doing a much better job of reacting to that and putting seasonally, more correct product that customers want in our stores this past month.","And lastly, I'm going to take my hat off to our store teams. Our store execution in the second quarter was very good. There was a lot of stores in the second quarter. I saw not only the enthusiasm behind our store associates, but I think the standards, the execution, the visual merchandising, the windows were all a step above. That's been a big contributor to the company's performance on sales.","Gap Inc. Direct was up 24%. That obviously helps. When you look at our 4% comp in the second quarter, that was a good performance by that team. And the only thing that we're focusing on is our traffic was negative. And we know for the business to fire on all cylinders, we not only need to have AUR happening, store execution, the right product investments, but we need to have positive traffic. So you\u2019ll see some further focus in that area in the second half of 2012.","Now we did end strongly, which I felt great about. I mean, that was a 10% comp in July. It's been a long time since we've had a double-digit comp like that. The calendar shift helped a little bit. We're a very holiday-driven business with so many outlet stores and Old Navy. Regardless of that, a 10% comp was a very nice way to end the quarter.","Next I want to talk about is our International business. We had a minus 5% comp in Q2. And they expected, and we expected, a better business. So let me give you a little further color behind that minus 5% performance. It's obviously difficult in Europe right now. But what we feel good about our actual store distribution in the European market is we're very concentrated in key cities. London, Paris, Milan and Rome is a big percentage of our European business. As Europe begins a recovery at some point in the future, I think we're positioned properly by being much more dominant in those key cities.","In Japan, this was the first full quarter that anniversaried the disaster of 3\/11. And us, like other Japanese retailers, were clearing through spring and summer product as traffic dropped significantly in the Japanese market. So we were up against that very aggressive clearance quarter. And I believe that, that will be behind us more in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And we have expectations that we'll have a better performance in Japan in the second half. And China's too small right now to be material to our comp number.","Our total sales in the second quarter were up 6%. International business was up 7%. So even though the comp was negative, total sales were up 7% internationally.","Our Franchise business, up 25%, continues to go from strength to strength. Athleta opened 11 stores. I'm going to pause for a second. That's just a really good number for a young team to execute and deliver on. I was in a lot of those stores this summer. I think the store teams have executed well, and customers are responding very positively to have a physical presence of the brand in their neighborhood. Our global outlet business added 10 stores in the second quarter. That contributed to the 2% spread. And lastly, we opened up our first Old Navy store outside of North America, in Tokyo. I was there the week after it opened and was really impressed not only by how well we translated the brand into a whole new market, but the response of customers and families, in particular, which is the cornerstone of the Old Navy brand, was great to see when I was in Tokyo. So that will lay a nice groundwork. We're testing ideas, we're trying different things, but I think that sets us up nicely for the rollout of Old Navy in Japan in 2013.","From a margin perspective, we had a very nice lift in the second quarter. We are working aggressively on ticket integrity, selling product at full, regular price. I think that's been helpful to us. That doesn't just happen through a great product, although that's the initial first driver. It happens through words in the store or how our store associates sell it, what goes in the window. It also helps that the marketing investments we are making, we are creating demand on the first day. It either shows up online or shows up in the store. And this was the first quarter since late 2011 where our average unit cost, our cost of goods, were not significantly above the year before, and that contributed to the performance.","As a business, we are still very committed to making the right thoughtful investments in our SG&A line. One is marketing. Gap North America has been receiving some incremental marketing in the first half of this year, driving the Be Bright campaign. That has had really good feedback. Whether it's online we've heard through social media or in our stores, the campaign is resonating. Our digital investment, like other retailers, we're putting money behind digital. Whether that's online marketing or other tools, we understand where customers are shopping, we understand where they're getting their information. We've done some very good work on that front. And lastly, some money\u2019s gone into store labor. We've got some service models we're looking at selectively in key stores. We're testing some ideas as I think there's an investment there in the second quarter that helped.","And in closing, when you perform and deliver $0.49 in earnings per share over last year's $0.35, a 40% increase in EPS, of course, I think overall, people here are energized. It's a good feeling inside the business. What I have to do is make sure everybody stays focused. And that's what's critical, is what got us here to this performance. I just keep doing that. I keep repeating it.","We mentioned on these calls before, the last fall was an important moment in the company: make sure that Gap Inc. comes out strong at the beginning of 2012. And that's what we've done. But we know that sustained performance is what matters, and everybody here is working hard every single day to make sure we maintain the momentum in the back half that we enjoyed in the first half of 2012.","So with that said, let me hand over Sabrina, who will take you through the financial results of Q2 2012. Sabrina?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone.","We're very pleased with our second quarter performance as we again made meaningful progress against our 2012 priorities, including driving increased sales, investing in our business and growing earnings per share.","Here are some highlights. Consistent with the first quarter, net sales were up 6%, comparable sales were up 4% and our North American divisions, again each posted positive comps. Operating margin was up 200 basis points. Earnings per share grew 40%. And in addition, we generated strong free cash flow and returned approximately $410 million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends.","Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the second quarter, operating income was up $91 million or 27%. Net earnings were up $54 million and earnings per share were $0.49, up from $0.35 last year.","Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. Second quarter total sales were $3.6 billion, up 6% with comp sales up 4%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 14% to $1.4 billion. Second quarter gross margin was up 300 basis points to 39.9%. Our merchandise margins were up 210 basis points driven by the combination of growth in average unit retail and decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 90 basis points.","Turning to inventory on Slide 7. As foreshadowed in our July sales press release, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 6% on last year's up 5%.","Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We\u2019ve noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses in 2012 and highlighted that it's likely we'll deleverage operating expense. In line with that framework, second quarter total operating expenses were approximately $1 billion, up $85 million from the prior year. The increases were focused on our Gap Inc. Direct division, which grew sales 24% in the quarter, as well as marketing and store payroll investments across our other channels. Marketing expenses grew $33 million to $147 million, with the biggest increase driven by Gap brand's investment in windows, outdoor and digital media.","Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Second quarter capital expenditures were $149 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we opened 9 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,035 stores. Net square footage was down 2% compared to Q2 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.","Regarding cash and share counts on Slide 10. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $673 million, and we ended the second quarter with about $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the second quarter, we repurchased 13.1 million shares for $349 million at an average price of $26.65. We ended the quarter with 479 million shares outstanding.","And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress during the first half of the year, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week, to $1.95 to $2. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 10% to about 11%. As a reminder, it's our objective to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins.","A few things to keep in mind regarding our margins. While our average unit costs are improving in the back half versus 2011, they are not back to 2010 levels. It's also important to remember that in each quarter of 2011 and through Q1 of 2012, our average unit retails grew as we decreased units in the face of escalating product costs. Therefore, our plan to introduce more unit inventory in the second half of 2012 primarily at Old Navy may cause our average unit retail growth to slow compared to the first half of the year.","Regarding inventory. Although we plan to add units during the second half because the cost of each unit is lower, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q3 are expected to be down in the low single digits to last year.","Regarding operating expenses. Given the progress we've made on our product, as evidenced by customer response year-to-date, we believe it's prudent to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Specifically, we expect the increase over last year in operating expense in each of the remaining quarters to be at least as large as it was in the second quarter. As a result, we continue to expect to deleverage operating expense in the second half.","Moving on to cash. Our principles remain intact. Our stated priorities for the uses of cash are, first, to reinvest in our business to the degree we have projects that will deliver appropriate returns; and second, to distribute excess cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the improvement in our operating performance, we are increasing our full year capital guidance and are comfortable spending up to $675 million versus our previous guidance of about $600 million. Consistent with our strategy, the increase will be focused on remodels that accompany store consolidations and downsizes, as well as other store-related projects. We also plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we've consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012.","Finally, we plan to repay our $360 million term loan. This repayment, which has no prepayment penalty, will eliminate negative spread and further support our investment grade rating.","The following full year guidance metrics remains unchanged: net square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores, net of repositions, about 120 openings and about 115 closures; depreciation and amortization, about $475 million; effective tax rate, about 39.5%.","In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategies during the first half of the year and our focus on delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions. And we'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Barbara Wyckoff with Credit Agricole Securities.","Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about China and potential expansion in China? How many stores are you going to open over the next 3 or 4 years? Can you compare some of the metrics on those stores relative to, say, the U.S. stores or Japan?","Glenn K. Murphy","It's a little premature to talk out 3 to 4 years what -- just as a sort of reminder to everybody on the phone, we're going to do 30 stores this year. That's our commitment. The news within that 30-store profile is that we're going to open up in 5 new cities. So we'll be in 10 cities at the end of the year, which sort of part of our real estate strategy was to go into Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong. And then last year, we opened up in 2 other cities, which were Tianjin and Hangzhou, and we're going be in 5 more cities by the end of this year. Such newsworthy because it allows us to answer your question actually, Barbara, which is, I'm not saying anybody, but brands, if you have a brand positioning globally, you can go into Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong and likely carve yourself up a decent-sized business. But to find out how big can China become given the fact that it's the second biggest market for apparel in the world, just passed Japan about 12 months ago, we decided to go in and make sure how well can we perform. But again, to your point on productivity, on return on capital, on sort of overall sales, how can we do in markets that we're going to need to get into and penetrate and be successful in order to have a meaningful business. So that's important for us to learn that. Second thing we did, we went online day 1, which we'll have our second anniversary this November. That was also important to find out: how would the Chinese consumers buy online, because it's different than it is here in the U.S., and that's not uncommon. In a lot of countries, the online penetration, the reception of it, yes, can be different. We've been very pleased with our online business. That's good to our overall strategy. And the third leg, to answer your question, in the future is we're opening 3 outlet stores this year. And I was actually just in China, and I was really impressed. I did outlet centers before, but I saw our 2 stores, 2 of the 3 that are under construction, and the quality of the sites, the quality of the cotenancy, which is really good for us. You're talking about Coach and Nike and people who we actually have nice cotenancy relations with here in the U.S. So I think I was impressed with that. So the answer, we'll know probably a little bit more at our analyst meeting next year. We'll be able at a -- figure out more about our strategic plan for China, where that's going to go. And -- but I'm -- I've always been a believer that, that was a great market for us because of our multiple brands, which we've not decided yet beyond Gap if we're going to do anything. The only decision we made so far is one brand with multiple channels. But I've always felt good about the market because of the American component of our brands and how well that resonates with Chinese consumers. And the last part will be that we do very well, and our marketing has skewed towards the millennials here in North America, and a version of that in China is the golden generation. And I think our marketing, our positioning, what we stand for, what this company believes in those brands -- our brands have -- our brand so far has done very well. So more to come, but we're off to a very good start.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Morris with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to ask a little bit about the plans that you have talked about with respect to taking some of the savings that you've had from lower product costs, cotton and whatnot. You mentioned and touched on this in some of your prepared remarks, but maybe go a little bit deeper where we might expect to see that reinvestment deployed. I think we've talked about fabrics before, but you're pointing to labor, payroll and, it sounds like, marketing. So knowing those, maybe go deeper on each one of those and how you see the returns from those investments coming in, what gives you the confidence that you'll see the returns? Clearly, we see the improvement in product, but more color there would be great.","Glenn K. Murphy","I'll take them in the order in which you put them forward, John. I'd say in the product side, which is -- and you add together the amount of money that Sabrina and I were comfortable, working with our brand presence this year, reinvesting in 2012 given, one, our -- a sort of stepped up level of confidence. We are nowhere near where we want to be, but we'd start feeling more comf [ph] than last fall as we look towards the spring and what our teams were able to get done and some of the changes, obviously, we made to get the confidence we started to feel internally last fall. So it starting with the product piece, that's the larger amount of the reinvest we're making in product. You saw some in the spring, and we were able, in the spring, to get an early read and we have ways these days to get a little earlier read than we used to. So I would say that, that encouraged us to continue on the same path. Maybe a bit of a step-up in investment in the third quarter in product, and the fourth quarter will be about the same as the third quarter. So the majority of this is, if you talk to our teams, and you've heard me say this before, but it's always worth repeating, to me the success ultimately of us selling products at full price and driving the kind of AUR performance that we believe we need to have inside of this business given our brands starts with having the right styles, and that's -- belongs to our design team, and having the right color. That's in spite of the move towards a color trend this year. We were not happy with the colors we put forward last year. So style, color, fit is critical, which, again, our design team and our production team owns. And there were some decisions made on categories that we want to be more dominant in. And I've listed some in the past. In Gap, it's get -- be -- being dominant in babyGap, being dominant in denim. That's important. For, obviously, Banana Republic, it's in suiting, and that's in woven shirts. But taking some of those categories that we can go out and we can give them the space they need because if you're going to put an investment in quality, that should come then with an investment in inventory, which should come with an investment in space in the store, which should come with an investment of the service model inside the store and, lastly, investment in marketing. So what we've been working on since last fall is the continuum of that, taking a product asset in each one of our brands and not just putting quality for the sake of putting quality because, in some cases, that could be money unnecessarily being spent. But being disciplined in how we do it, and then take it all the way that continuum I just took you through. So I'd say the difference you'll see in fall and holiday versus spring and summer is some decisions we\u2019ve made on categories that we're able to chase into or some speed categories where we still think there's an opportunity to ultimately get. The goal here is to drive our value proposition, which is not overpaying for quality. So putting the quality where it makes sense, making sure of the right ticket price and driving right-price sales. Marketing, early days. I made -- I mentioned in my opening comments that if there's a metric that Sabrina and I are staring at and going, \"We'd like to see a little bit more of that\" is traffic. And there's no need to unnecessarily beat ourselves up over 40% increase in EPS, but we are always looking for the next opportunity. So the marketing piece, and I'm sure people have heard this maybe from other retailers, but as you shift your business model ever so slightly, we're still going to offer value, we're still going to have promotions. That's important particularly at Old Navy and in our outlet business. But as we shift to marketing, what is the acceptable lag effect until that pool of traffic gets replenished so maybe it's a better quality pool of traffic. So Sabrina and I are working with the brand presence. We'll make sure those investments. First of all, it's good quality marketing. In the past, when we have not spent money in marketing, because we weren't happy with it. And our marketing leaders know that if we're happy with the marketing and it makes sense and it's going to drive traffic and it's going to inspire customers, we'll put the money behind it. So I think the Gap will continue to be, I'd say, the focus in the back half, Gap brand, mostly in North America. As Barbara asked earlier, China will continue to be a focus because it takes a long time to build your brand in China. And maybe it's a little smaller but still important to us is Athleta as we're starting to build that brand and put the stores out. After all, a physical store is a manifestation of the marketing investment to create the brand. So back half, we're committed to it. And look, first call in February, we said we'd take it quarter by quarter. But now that we've seen -- and we look at a lot of research besides traffic. We're feeling comfortable about the back half, about some investments in marketing. And the labor piece. That one, I tried to say in the opening call, it's really just some tests we're doing right now in our labor modeling. We made some tough decisions on labor during the heights of the recession in 2008, 2009, and we know that ultimately, our store environment, our store experience is critical. So whether that's the capital investments we're making, the right ones, but also labor investments, I would say that's more predominant inside of Banana Republic and Gap, and more predominant inside big markets. And so you look at the top 10 DMAs, you look at those 2 big brands, and that's where the labor tests and trying to step up our service model is taking place.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, Glenn, we know we're still a month away, I guess, from the new Old Navy President starting, but wondering if you can give some of your thoughts of -- how you thought the 2Q numbers looked at that business, and then how you think that brand is positioned today and sort of what's your hopes maybe a year from now of what you and the new President can do for the positioning and also what he brings to the overall company.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I have -- I have a lot of thoughts on that, but I'm going to keep it short because, obviously, for the company to step up and hire somebody as impressive as Stefan from such a company that we respect like H&M just because we do believe, through multiple meetings with him in the spring before he made the decision he was going to join us, we liked how he was thinking about retail, about product, about winning and what he's done in his past and his global experience. So as I said in the previous call, we're just very excited for him to join us in October. In advance of him joining us, and I'll get back to him in a second, I'm quite pleased with what Nancy Green and Tom Sands have done. You've got to give them credit. A lot of times at retail, when a leader leaves, businesses tend to sort of stay status quo, in some cases even flounder, because leadership changes can be impactful on a brand. And so kudos to them. We might step in to help out as much as I can, but they've really led that business and that team. I'd say the thing that they've been doing is, I think, that they've been really cleaning up and keeping the business simple, because I'm a big fan of taking on new initiatives in the business, and at times, you may take on a little bit too much and Old Navy is cleaning that up. They've gotten very, very focused on 3 initiatives. That's all they talk about. I'm not going to share those on the phone, but just 3 key focuses that whole business had, and that's what they brought. Another thing I will add, I believe our agency and our marketing team, which right now Michelle DeMartini is overseeing for us, she's one of our most senior merchants -- our marketing at Old Navy, which I love the positioning of the brand, we've talked about, but has not changed since I've been here, but the new platform and how to communicate the voice of the brand has really been good. I've been pleased since June. And you've seen their business, and I think that's helping their business quite a bit. I mean, obviously, it starts with product like every other brand. But more than any other brand, I think their marketing has really resonated with their customers, and I've been very happy with that. What's Stefan going to do, it's -- I said I -- in fairness to him, he's had many, many months to think about it, but until he gets here and meets the team and works with them and figures out what he believes strategically, he's going to do matches up with what's -- what the team was able to get done. It's a little too soon to tell. I do know, and I'm -- so just an appropriate forum to share it with you, I do know what his vision is, having talked to him back in may. Obviously, he's away from us till October, but the last time I talked to him, whatever it was, 6 months ago, 4 months ago, I know that he definitely has a vision of what he wants to. So we'll see how that plays out and translates inside of our business. I -- but I want to make sure, one thing that's important to me to make clear. His coming into the business was not driven by the most recent global ambitions we have for the brand. That's a given. I mean, he opened in a number of the countries at H&M. Obviously, they're a global retailer like Gap is, a global brand that is. So that, I think, is icing on the cake. I believe he is going to come in with a very strong perspective and position when it comes to product. That's what he knows, having worked in that business. So that's not taking Old Navy to H&M because he's understand the difference. But I believe he's going to really help us between the design conceptually to the merchandising, to the process, to the cost part, all the way to in-store execution. I think that part of Old Navy he is going to be super strong at, and the global piece will come over time. We only got one store in Japan. I think that'll just be a nice story to talk about in 2, 3, 4 years from now.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Dorothy Lakner with Caris & Company.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","A question for Sabrina. You gave us a lot of detail about how you're looking at gross margin and the various components, particularly on the merchandise margin side, in the second half of the year. And I know you had said after first quarter, don't expect that kind of leverage on rent and occupancy that we saw in the first quarter. And we didn't in second quarter. So my question is how should we look at that component of gross margin in the second half?","Sabrina L. Simmons","And are you talking about, Dorothy, the ROD component in particular?","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. Yes. I guess to try and be helpful because we don't guide explicitly to ROD. I did take note, as you mentioned, in the first quarter that, that was an unusually high amount of leverage, and it would be not prudent, in our view, to extrapolate that. Sure enough, the ROD leverage was the same kind of level of comp at plus 4. It was 90 basis points in Q2. There are many variables that we've talked about that quarter-to-quarter could impact ROD, including the timing of our store openings, settlements with landlords, when amendments come through. So there's a lot of variables. But what I would say is the Q2 relationship to that level of comp is certainly a more appropriate level than we saw in Q1. So that would be a good kind of starting point to think about it for the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies & Company.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Glenn, obviously, your tone is very upbeat. What did you think you have to -- where you could have improved during the next quarter to get to that next level for the company? And it looks like obviously, you're going to start to grow again here. So it feels like a more sustainable basis. Where do you think the organization at this size can grow if we think about a normalized growth rate? And then lastly, do you -- what's your long-term kind of vision for Athleta? And do you think we're going to get some more concrete long-term vision on what you think -- how big you think that organization can be at your analyst meeting in the fall?","Glenn K. Murphy","Okay, let me try to deal with that one at a time. I'd say the first one, Randy, is something I -- to be repetitive, that's what I said to John, I think the traffic number was a number -- and I'm not here to rank necessarily all the metrics in order. Let's say you know the company, and a lot of people on the phone do. We're never really happy. And I think that our team has definitely embraced that sentiment. If there's a -- this is a quarter where we celebrate a few small wins. And we had some small wins, but the team executed well. We're particularly pleased, as I said in my opening comments, coming off last year where we were not at all happy with the business. Even though there was some circumstances outside of our control, we just weren't happy. Traffic is a number that we would prefer to not see negative. It's a number that we do look at holistically between our specialty business, our outlet business and our online business. If you look at it holistically, it's probably a different picture. But at the end of the day, our store traffic, being negative in the quarter, is something that all of our teams, our store leaders, our brand presidents all know that in order to be happy as a business, we'd like to see all our metrics in positive territory with the with the exception of AUC. Such is the way we have to start looking at the business. And -- but we also know that businesses' comp is an outcome. What -- how you get to comp is by taking certain strategies and really trying to take them deep. So this is just hypothetical, but maybe one brand is working more on AT, one brand is working more on units per transaction, one brand maybe working more on AUR. They have to pick the metric that supports their overall strategies. And as long as the key metrics they're trying to move in a positive direction to get to an outcome, like comp, is the framework of their performance, is meeting what they tell us they're going to do, then Sabrina and I are happy. But yes, we're always looking for -- knowing this business as well as I do now, coming from obviously different industries, what I do know as a metric that is going very well for you for a period of time, you'd be foolish to count on it for a number of years. So you always have to make sure there's other metrics that could get to the outcome of comp, that you're putting plans in place to strengthen them. As one of the outcomes, we're trying to get to your second question, can we grow long term. It's obviously our goal. But when I think of growth, one thing I do want to put forward only because it's a number I asked Katrina for the other day, is in Q2 2011, we had 163 more stores than we do today. By that, I mean we closed 163 stores between Q2 '11 and Q2 '12. When you think of growth, I always think comp is a metric that everybody should look at, but I'm all about top line sales. So that's a number we've said publicly that we're closer to the end of our real estate strategy, which involves closing down square footage at a time necessary, consolidation from Kids and baby [indiscernible] Gap into Adult, and also closing stores. We've done more. We have more to do, but we've done more in the last 3 years. We're closer to the end than the beginning. That will certainly help top line growth. And that's a number that's important to me. Comp plus spread equals total sales. While I'm not -- I have huge appreciation for comp, I have always been about top line sales. So I think growth, I think, will look more promising in the future when we get to the end of executing our real estate strategy. And lastly, Athleta, you heard me pause on my opening comments. I mean, 11 stores in one quarter to a team that 18 months ago didn't have a store, it's pretty impressive when you think about it. I mean, some people, obviously, open 150, 200 stores in a quarter, but for that team to come where they've come, and I've been to a lot of real estate to hear the comments from customers in particular who wanted a physical manifestation of that brand, I'm very proud of that team in Petaluma led by Scott Key. They've done a great job. And this is early days. Well, I'd to tell you in the spring about what our plans for 2013, but we will open our 25 stores in 2012. We feel good about it right now. Great customer response. And I think that they think, and I'm more willing to support them than not, although it's early days, they feel they've got a bit of a tiger by the tail. And let's them feel that way. Nothing wrong with a little bit of confidence from our latest brand. We'll have more to talk about from Athleta in our meetings in the spring.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the Gap outlet channel. Maybe we see, I think, a lot of the time -- more of the time the products and the full-price stores and the marketing. Maybe talk about the products and marketing initiatives for the outlet stores. And how's store traffic there? Is it also negative? And how many stores are you at now? And where do you expect the growth there to be?","Glenn K. Murphy","Thanks for asking about outlet because that's -- I can talk about that business again. And like I said about the Athleta, we're very pleased and proud of our 2 leaders, Ann Doyle and Andi Owen, who run our 2 factory store outlet businesses. Is the traffic better there than in a specialty store? The answer is yes. So that's why I said earlier that if you take specialty plus outlet, plus online and bring that together as one traffic number, our traffic is actually not that bad. But we have to look at it at channel by channel by channel. And our outlet channel is definitely, the traffic is better. So that's good. I think that's a little bit about the -- just the overall traffic that is in that genre of real estate. But the other thing is our team -- I'm glad you mentioned marketing. Our team is actually -- again, for a team that had no marketing when I started here and don't have a big marketing budget, but they're very, very scrappy and smart about how they spend their marketing, and they have great customer connections, whether that's through emails or through some of the partnerships they've done. So I think the marketing there, which is not a big driver of this increase in our SG&A, but they are getting a little bit more marketing than they have in the past, so they're making good use of it. And what we don't talk about, and that's -- I think everybody on this -- on the phone always wants to focus on our specialty business, particularly Gap, which I understand. But the product improvement at the -- in the outlet channel has been equal, at a minimum equal if not, some feel, they argue, better. But the step-up in the product and the investments, what they've done there, has been great. Very, very impressed. I've been in those stores a lot. I'll be out on Friday in some of them. So those merchant teams, those marketing teams under that leadership of a channel which we feel we have a competitive advantage in, we would -- we will continue to drive globally, is nothing short of impressive. So that's -- it's good to see. And we have high expectations for them going forward, but that's -- they're off also to a very good start so far this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Adrienne Tennant with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Glenn, my question is it sounds like you're happy with the Old Navy television advertising. And I was wondering if there are any changes to the fall season marketing plan for Old Navy and if you'll be adding Gap TV back. And then, Sabrina, just a clarifying question. On your operating expense guidance, was that year-over-year or was that by percentage of sales?","Glenn K. Murphy","On Old Navy, as I -- as far as I know, that -- there's going to be maybe one last week of television in the third quarter. But what I'm happy about is that as you put this new platform together, back -- what has it been now, just less than a year, I'm really liking the new creative. So people, which is our core customer, are responding positively to what they've seen over the last couple of months, which I think has really helped our traffic profile. And let's see how -- what transpires in the fall and holiday. I think that the messaging, how it resonates, how well the creative is showing the product, goes back to what I said earlier. If you're making an investment in product, it has to have a follow-up investment in store space, in service model. And ultimately, marketing has to show the investments you're making in your product. And I think Old Navy team has done a really good job of that, as well as our agency. So maybe one last week, but I think it's better quality of marketing that we're putting out there. And I just saw the holiday and the Thanksgiving ideas the team has, and I actually feel really good about it. It's a lot of work still to be done, but they've put forward not only good Q3 ideas, but the early ideas behind Q4 certainly motivate me to make sure that their spend stays, at a minimum, equal to last year. But I think that's good. And I think you'll...","Sabrina L. Simmons","And to clarify, Adrienne, thanks for asking the question, what we meant is in the second quarter, operating expenses were up $85 million. That translates to about 9% increase over LY. So we mean that in Q3 and Q4, you'd expect at least a 9% increase in operating expenses over last year's quarters.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then Gap TV?","Glenn K. Murphy","No plans right now. I think one thing you should look for this fall is our new campaign just came out as we did shoot some film of the new Icons redefined campaign, which supports Be Bright. So it's the fall campaign for the Be Bright platform. And we're going to be in cinema with that and definitely on social media. And I think it's some of the better work we've also done. So is there television in Gap's future? Maybe. I mean, we never said we'll never do it. But at the same time, right now, we're very happy with the mediums we're using. We're being very effective. And digital's been a great medium for us. I think our new marketing team, our team here in San Francisco, our teams around the world and our team in -- teams in New York really have embraced digital. And if you can great content and use digital, I think that, that can be very effective, too. So if you do get a chance in the next week or so to see some of the film that was done and the content, it is really -- it's really well done. And it supports the brand, and I think it resonates very strongly. And could that lead to television? Only time will tell.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betty Chen with Wedbush Morgan Securities.","Betty Y. Chen - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Glenn, I was hoping you can talk a little bit more about the core product categories for each of the brands. I know that you had mentioned that the team is certainly focusing behind them in terms of style and fit and many of the other categories to make sure that the consumers continue to really be compelled to buy them at the right price. So I was curious on so far, now that we've got 2 quarters down, how do you think about -- how is the team executing in those core categories in your opinion? And how is the team able to get earlier reads, as you had mentioned, I think, earlier in the call? What are some of the message you're using? And then lastly, I was just thinking in terms of the International business, certainly, we're going after many of the markets with different models. Now that we're -- still early on, but now that we're in some of these markets, have your thinking in terms of how you're going into these markets varied at all? And can we look for some changes in the future?","Glenn K. Murphy","Okay. It seems to be the day of 3 questions. So on the first one, what I do feel good about is that the stepped up performance in our top line sales, for the most part, has been driven by the categories we identified to make some reinvestments in. I think I was giving my theory on comp earlier. The same thing applies to product. Comp is an outcome. If you're -- if you have a 4% comp, like we did in the second quarter across our multiple brands, that was a 7% in Gap, a 7% in Banana Republic, a 3% at Old Navy, let's just take Banana Republic for now. So you had a 7% comp. To get to that, the team has to plan certain categories they really believe and want to invest with all the reasons I gave earlier to try to get to 10% comp in that business, a 12% comp. Because if you try to get everything at a 7%, you're going to make some mistakes and the outcome will not be a 7%. So what I do like about the business so far is where they decided to stand behind what they believed in. This is not new. We've always had categories we want to have a competitive advantage in, we want to be dominant in our competitive set and want, therefore, to find product assets. Those have not totally changed since I've been here. We've just been more focused on them. And this next slide was putting some money behind it, and I think that's really worked out. And I think the comp numbers are being driven in a large way by those categories we believe in. Early reads, all of our stores, we don't have a model like some other businesses. But the early reads where they help us but we're doing it through social media by getting us some early reads on products that's not quite bought, which has been a helpful tool to us, or finding a way as product goes on our online site earlier and goes on our store, get early reads we could chase in, that's the most effective form of speed we can do. Early read, I [indiscernible] go through again, by crowd sourcing, let's call it for lack of a better word, and getting some feedback to help us better understand if that's the right product, whether it's a pattern, a print, a color, a style. But really, when you get in season, that's when I get excited. You get an early read online and read quickly through the fabric platforming we've done to be able to chase back in a very short period of time back in the goods that are going to be in our store more than 6 weeks. That's a process that we've been talking about in these calls for a number of years. We slowed speed down last year and chased down because with cotton being so unpredictable, we didn't want to have a -- change our business model too aggressively in 2011. In '12 now, we pushed our teams, and they've absolutely embraced the fact that there's a way to get some early reads, albeit probably not used in our past, and get to react more quickly. So faster pipeline, a speed pipeline and a way to get feedback from either a form of crowd sourcing or immediately through an online channel and then reacting to it much faster than we used to. That's in the early days, but it's helping us. The last part, the International formats we use, the only thing we have ever said, and then -- I don't think we ever changed any market we went corporate in, and we wouldn't change any market we've gone franchise in. It's the only thing we've ever said, is as we look forward, are there markets we consider joint venture. We don't want to take that off the table. That may be an option. Look at a markets like India. If we were to consider that at some point in the future, the only way to go with India right now is through a joint venture. So we're not against that if our franchisees wanted to turn it into a joint venture, if there's a franchise opportunity to go to corporate. We're not looking at those today. But I would say as our business continues to evolve and we look at our performance, we don't want to be completely married to the format we have. But there isn't a single decision we've made so far to go franchise in a country that we would ever change. I think every one of those was a good decision, and there isn't a single corporate country we went into -- we are in today we'd ever turn to franchise. So for the most part, what we've done so far is we're going to stick with. But let's look at the next 2, 3, 4 years and see if there's any change to the franchise relationships we have. I doubt it. But I'm just sort of saying that will be the only way we change any kind of relationship that we currently have in a market.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Lejuez with Nomura Securities.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Glenn, you talked about traffic being down. Can you just clarify, was traffic down at each brand? And regardless of the answer there, can you maybe talk about what the comp drivers were at each of the brands, whether it be conversion, AUR, UPT, and how that might be likely to change as we move into the second half?","Glenn K. Murphy","I think you answered your first question rightly because I can't give it out by brand. We were just sort of -- just given you a \"total across the business\" number. Sabrina can shed some light definitely on all the different metrics. I mean, I have the metrics, and I -- what I can say before I hand it to her is to repeat something I said earlier, which is important, that our teams definitely realize that you have to be at a -- look a little deeper into your -- into their business and say \"Where do I want to drive something across some of the different metrics you mentioned,\" Paul, \"to get to the right outcome?\" But at the same time, they're always looking in the rearview mirror and going, \"What are some other metrics\" they may want to strengthen because something could happen to UPT that's not of our making, whether it's the economy or macro events. So they're always trying to find a way to make sure that the delta between our highest-performing metric and our worst-performing metric is not too wide. In our past, that's been a problem we had. so I think here, they're trying to make sure that they tighten that up. I'll let Sabrina give you some color on the metrics.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, and just a little bit more color on traffic because Glenn has been talking about that a bit, I mean, as he mentioned Gap outlet in particular. But the outlet and Old Navy relative to the other divisions, I think it's fair to say that value segment has had better traffic than the specialty segment, broadly speaking, on traffic. With regard to the other comp lever metrics, again, we don't put [ph] division by division, but it's generally true that average unit retail being up and conversion being up are the 2 strongest metrics that drove the performance across the quarter.","Operator","Your final question for today will come from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the operating margin guidance of 11%. You're running nicely above that year-to-date. I understand there are some investments to continue to be made. But what are the drivers that would cause the operating margin to fall below 11% to get to your full year target in the back half?","Sabrina L. Simmons","As you know, Lorraine, I think there's just a lot of scenarios we run, and I think we landed on about 11% because of the architecture of how we're looking at how the year will unfold. We obviously have said it is our primary objective to drive consistent top line growth with healthy merchandise margins. So we definitely want to see that nice expansion. Offsetting some of that, we tried to be very clear that we expect to deleverage on operating expenses. So between that combination, it's how we get to about 11%. What we're pleased with is we started the year with about 10% guidance, and it's obviously another objective of ours to expand our operating margin back over time. So this is a nice step back, standing here in Q2, that we feel comfortable bringing it up a whole point.","Katrina O'Connell","I'd just like to thank everyone for joining the call today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Gap Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O'Connell","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's call is intended to cover both our third quarter earnings results and the company's organizational announcements issued today in separate press releases.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains certain forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we're required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 20, 2014, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","I also want to mention that Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investor Relations section at gapinc.com. Joining us on the call today are current Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy; Art Peck, current President Growth, Innovation and Digital and future CEO; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","As usual, Glenn and Sabrina will share the earnings results for the quarter. In addition, both Glenn and Art will also share their respective views on the announced leadership transitions. Please note that Art is joining us on the call from New York today, so he will make his comments and then turn his attention to the teams in New York. Therefore, he will not join for Q&A; however, after our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and Glenn and Sabrina will be available for questions.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sabrina.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I'll begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full year guidance.","While we're not proud of our third quarter sales performance, driven by a particularly tough result at Gap brand, we are pleased that the team has demonstrated strong discipline on both expense and inventory. Net income for the third quarter was $351 million, and we delivered earnings per share of $0.80, up 11% to last year. As a reminder, our Q3 earnings per share of $0.80 includes a non-recurring benefit of about $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate of 34.5% in the quarter.","Regarding sales for the third quarter, total net sales were flat at $4 billion and comp sales were down 2%. For the quarter, the translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported sales by $31 million, primarily due to the weakening yen and Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, therefore, our revenues were up 1%.","Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margins were up 20 basis points to 40.2% with a favorability versus our prior outlook being driven by non-merchandise items like shrink and shipping. Merchandise margins were up 90 basis points for the quarter with Old Navy delivering the strongest margin performance. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 70 basis points.","Regarding SG&A, third quarter total operating expenses were $1 billion, up $29 million from the prior year. Marketing expenses were up $14 million to last year at $176 million. Excluding the credit card income reclass of about $40 million, operating expense dollars would actually have been below last year.","Regarding the balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, we're pleased that inventory ended down 2% per store, below our previous guidance. We ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash.","Given our opportunistic approach to share buybacks, we're pleased we repurchased 11.4 million shares in the quarter with a vast majority of those shares bought at a price of about $36.50. Year-to-date we've used over $1 billion to repurchase 26 million shares. We've also distributed nearly $300 million in dividends, resulting in total cash distributions through October of more than $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with 424 million shares outstanding.","Regarding capital expenditures and store count, year-to-date CapEx was $508 million. We ended the quarter with 3,266 company-operated stores, and square footage was up about 2% compared with Q3 2013. Store count and square footage details are listed in our press release.","And now I\u2019d like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Overall, our expectation is that the holiday season will remain highly promotional and competitive. We're revising our full year earnings per share outlook to $2.73 to $2.78, which includes the Q2 gain on asset sale of about $39 million. The new range also includes a lower full year effective tax rate of about 38%, reflecting the third quarter tax benefit.","In addition, we now expect operating margins to be about 12.5%. Our guidance range assumes current foreign exchange rate to hold for the remainder of Q4. Given that some major currencies weakened meaningfully against the dollar in October, foreign exchange is likely to have a bigger negative impact on our Q4 earnings than we experienced in Q3. For the full year, we continue to estimate that foreign exchange will negatively impact our EPS growth rate by about 5 percentage points.","Regarding other full year guidance metrics, we've reduced our expected capital expenditures in response to a more challenging operating performance. We now expect CapEx to be about $700 million, down from our previous guidance of about $750 million. And we now expect depreciation and amortization to be about $500 million. Our net square footage guidance is unchanged at about 2.5%.","To be helpful, here are some other things to keep in mind. Clearly we plan to remain diligent in our expense management. As a reminder, we delivered a full point of leverage in the first half of the year. However, similar to the third quarter, we expect expenses to deleverage in the fourth quarter.","At the end of the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store to be down slightly. It's important to note that this guidance on inventory excludes any impact from the West Coast port issues. If we trigger any contingency plans that could impact inventory levels such as pulling forward receipts, we'll give you an update on our monthly sales call.","Finally, the guidance assumes we see no meaningful improvement in the trend for Gap brand, speaking of which as Katrina mentioned, today we also announced some important organizational changes at both Gap and Banana Republic.","So now that I've taken you through earnings, I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss those announcements in greater detail.","Glenn Murphy","Thank you, Sabrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Earlier today, we put out two press releases, the first one that just Sabrina just covered off, our Gap Inc.'s financial results for the third quarter 2014. And the second press release that we put out is about two presidents who will be leaving our business, so Art Peck, our new CEO, who will be taking over from me on February 1st can put the team he wants to put together going forward that gives Gap Inc. the best chance to have innovation to win more customers, to grow internationally and to be a top global retail apparel company around the world.","So at the end of day, I'm very supportive of what Art is doing. Conversations I've had with him have always been around, look, you have to put together the winning combination of existing executives, new executives that you think are right in order for Gap Inc. to achieve what I just said earlier to be the leading global retail apparel company around the world.","Steve Sunnucks will be leaving us before the end of the calendar year. I've known Steve now for eight years. He's worked for me that whole time. He's gone from running Europe to running franchise to running Asia. And we put Gap global together in New York City, and Steve is overseeing that now for two years. A lot of the structural work to bring Gap together have been done under Steve's leadership, but there's more work to do.","It's not quite complete. And certainly as Art and Jeff Kirwan, our new President for Gap Global, start working together, there's work to be done at Gap. Our performance has been a little less consistent we want it to be and there's definitely room for improvement. Under Art's leadership with Jeff at the helm, I believe Gap brand has a very strong opportunity to drive their business forward in 2015 and beyond.","Jack Calhoun, who I appointed to become President of Banana Republic a few months after I started in 2007, has really done a very good job for the company. I think Jack did a great job integrating outlet into the specialty business, integrating online to create this new Banana Republic global team and have one view of the brand across all customer touch points. And recently, the addition of Marissa Webb, who Jack recruited and hired to become our Creative Director, I really feel strongly that's going to position Banana Republic very well for the future.","Now Art made two very good decisions in appointing Andi Owen and Jeff Kirwan to become future presidents. I've known both these executives for the better part of eight years. I've worked side-by-side with them, have seen them grow, have seen them tested. Andi has got great experience, he grew up in the field, but always had this incredible merchant skill, an eye for product. And Jeff, who was running Canada, for Old Navy when I started in 2007, but the last three years has worked directly for me and driving the chain of business forward. The future of the company in terms of growth is really going to be very much focused on the China business.","So from my perspective, Art has made two very good decisions. He's putting the team together he wants to move forward with. So with that said, let me pass it over to Art and give him a couple of minutes to talk about the choices of Andi Owen and Jeff Kirwan. Art?","Art Peck","Thanks, Glenn. I really appreciate it, and let me echo Glenn's comments in his thanks to both Jack and Steve for their time with the company and service and commitment to the company. I want to spend a moment just talking about really why now, why I initiated these changes now.","The first I would point out that while I've had the benefit now of several weeks since we announced the transition to get to know more about parts of the company and the situation in the company that I've not been close to and familiar with. Being at the company for the last 10 years and having multiple roles around the company has really given me very broad and oftentimes very deep exposure to the executives in our senior roles. And that applies obviously both to Jeff in his role in China and to Andi in multiple roles while we've worked very closely together.","So I really appreciate the time to get to know things, but this is a change that is really based upon my deeper experience and knowledge of the company as well as knowledge of the talent that we have across the company.","I also would just communicate to you that I have inherited an extraordinarily strong and deep bench, and it's something I'm proud of for us as an organization and it's a reason why I have confidence that even with two changes like this, we will not miss our stride as an organization as we go into next year with this senior team in place.","But why now is very simple, which is I'm impatient to get the team in place for 2015 and ready to drive business results as we go into the new fiscal year. Let me spend a moment first then about Jeff. Obviously Jeff until now has been building our China business. I would describe Jeff as, number one, a great leader; number two, a very balanced executive; number three, somebody who really gets our brands and really gets brand building. There is a word that I will use with both Andi and Jeff, which is consistency.","Jeff has been a consistent deliverer of exceptional performance across all of the assignments that he's been in. I'll say the same thing about Andi, but I just want you to note that consistency for me in both of these executives and their track records is a critical issue.","Jeff and I have a high degree of urgency about the situation at Gap, and I'm very anxious to get him in there with the team working with me to get the business back on track. We owe that to our customers, to our employees and certainly to our investors. We need to get the aesthetic right for the brand. And I would note that this is something I've done before. So when I went to Gap in 2011, we also had an aesthetic issue there and it was highest priority in terms of writing the business. We worked on it during the course of that year and we made some improvements in the product during the year. And in 2012, we delivered with the team an exceptional performance.","And so I've been there, worked on these issues before, and I have a high degree of confidence that Jeff with my partnership working with the team can lead that team to getting the brand right quickly.","With Andi, again I would say a very balanced executive. She has been in a number of different functions in the company. She's worked across many of our brands. She's been in the online space. She's been in the specialty space. She's been in the outlet space. So she has really seen a bulk of what we do as a company and again delivered consistent performance across all of the key roles that we've put her in.","She is really an unusual executive for us. She grew up in the field organization, then transitioned into merchandising. She has demonstrated that she has an exceptional taste level, but she is also an exceptional leader. And that's what I get excited about Andi as well, as she is balanced, she is fluid across multiple disciplines in the business, she has great taste. And I think she will do very well in building on the work that Jack and Marissa and the team have done in terms of delivering more consistent performance in realizing the potential of Banana Republic.","So I've talked about both Jeff and Andi and I've used the word consistency. It's a very important word for me and it starts with exceptional product that we deliver consistently season after season. This is the focus that I have right now. It's the focus that Jeff will have going into that building with the team. And I know it's the focus that Andi has building on Jack's work as well.","Let me just wrap up then. I could talk about this for a long time. Hopefully you can hear in my comments the confidence that I have in both Jeff and Andi and the teams that they will be leading in these new roles. I also want to say that I am extraordinarily confident in the broader team here. The individuals running our P&Ls across Old Navy and Piperlime, Athleta and Intermix as well as my functional partners, I think, it's a very strong team. We're going to use December and January to really align our priorities and be ready to stand up in front of the company and in front of you with very clear priorities and a renewed focus as we go into next year.","With that, let me hand it back to Glenn.","Glenn Murphy","Thank you, Art. Art has to leave the call now, because he has to attend to a number of other matters. But Sabrina and I will be here to answer any questions related to the changes with our brand presidents. But before we get to that, I'd like to talk a little bit about Q3 and Q4. Then for sure we look forward to answering any questions you have.","When I think about the third quarter, my observation is we weren't as successful commercially as I wanted the business to be. With a minus-2% comp on a two-year basis that was minus-1%, now inside of that Old Navy certainly was stronger than the other brands, but I think Stefan Larsson is doing some very good work at Old Navy that hopefully can build every single quarter as we go forward.","So commercially, we learnt a lot of lessons. The team continues to commit to making our business stronger and stronger every single season. But a company like Gap Inc. with our six brands inside of our portfolio, I don't think anybody here ever thinks that we should negative comp, but it just makes no sense. So what does happen to us, I think the team gets more invigorated, more focused. Tenacity, which is such an important part of being a successful retailer comes through, but I think we're turning that tenacity to positive energy as we look at the fourth quarter.","But I would then look at that and say we had a much better quarter when it comes to the work done by our finance team, the one-time tax benefit and the cash that we now have inside the company to buy back more shares or to give us flexibility to buy back more shares. And also the work that was done this year, buyback in the quarter, buying over $400 million of shares. So I definitely tip my hat to Sabrina and her team and have told everybody else on the commercial revenue side of the business we need to do better.","Now we had some accomplishments in the quarter. In China, we opened our 100th store for Gap brand. I think that's exciting. That's great progress. And you heard me talk about Jeff Kirwan earlier. And Old Navy continues to do very well inside of China. So I think that combination we feel very good about as we look at China becoming the second most important country to Gap Inc. as we go forward.","We did a lot of good work on omni-channel and how is the company going to differentiate itself with our competitive advantages. We have over 1,000 stores with Wi-Fi. We will have a lot more of those done in the first quarter of next year. We have 1,000 stores and we do order in store. And so I think you'll see the omni-channel part of our business, the unique parts of that really drive sales for us in the fourth quarter.","I think the work on the margin rate, while I wasn't happy and really nobody in this company is happy with a minus-2% comp, the work done on the margin rate was actually pretty strong. So I'm pleased with that.","One change we made, which we haven't talked about a lot, is now our biggest distribution center, which is in New York state, we've now put an online pop-up inside of a store distribution center. So that's the beginning of our vision of seamless inventory. But what does it mean for 2014 holiday is we're going to extend the last date to ship to customers and it gives us a lot of flexibility on the East Coast, which is our biggest market, allows us to save a little bit of money when it comes to shipping expense. So I think that's a very good step, will help us in the P&L in the fourth quarter, but is a cornerstone of what seamless inventory will look in Gap Inc.","And of course the quarter was about succession, less than the announcements we made today, but a lot about a month ago when I announced that I'll be leaving the company as Chairman and CEO January 31st. And we have this incredible internal executive who is going to step up in Art Peck. That's probably the biggest news inside of the quarter.","Right now, we're a couple of weeks inside of Q4. We're excited about our opportunity to compete and to win. You heard in our recent sales announcement I put out. I do believe we have improved assortment in terms of the mix of our assortment. I think the team has done a very good job on products for the fourth quarter. Our customer communications are the best I've seen from us put forward in the holiday season. We've been planning this for the last nine months, putting them in place and now it's up to the teams, and our mobile business, our e-commerce business, our store teams and everybody around the world to go out and execute.","This is all about execution. I'm here right till the end of the fourth quarter, working with the teams in stores, pushing execution aggressively, because we are committed to one another to finish the year strong.","So with that said, I'm going to hand it over now back to Katrina and we'll take any questions we have from the analysts. Thank you, everybody.","Katrina O'Connell","Great. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now open up the call to questions. As a reminder, I have Glenn and Sabrina here to take Q&A. And we'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ed Yruma","I think when you last spoke, you were looking for some sign of hope within product with Gap brand. Obviously you're not guiding to any kind of financial improvement. But are you starting to see either signs of greater customer acceptance? Are you seeing some of this more optimistic color palette work? Any insight there would be helpful.","Glenn Murphy","We're not going to talk about, because the optimistic color you're referring to is the collection of the flow we just dropped about two weeks, which is anchored in crazy stripes, which is something we did seven years ago with fresh marketing. Look, we're pretty honest, I think, recently on the sales call that we really thought that we would see some signs of improvement in our September and October flow from Gap. I mean there's a few green chutes here and there in certain categories, which I guess when you look we're going to be investing our inventory going forward or in categories that showed a little bit of improvement in the third quarter. So I think that's a good sign.","It's a combination of the aesthetic we know has to continue to evolve and evolve quickly. And I believe some of that improvement will be in place either in the store today or in separate flows we have come in on the Monday after Thanksgiving, I think, on December 15th and again in the first week of January. We're next to full this year for Gap, which will provide more newness to the business. I think that improvement is in place on the flows I just talked about, but it's not enough to take us to a place where we've been satisfied.","There's been some better work done similar to Old Navy on the actual assortment and the investment of inventory in the parts of the business which we do feel good. So Gap brand, we feel good about our baby business. We feel good about our Gap fit business. We feel good about our outerwear business. There's certain parts we have with the inventory to match where we had evidence that we were starting to get the product to resonate much better than you've seen in the first nine months of this year.","So a little early on Q4. I think the extra flow was going to help, but we look forward to talking to people every single month, because that's our commitment in giving you updates on our performance and trying to answer more specifically the question about signs of positive acceptance by customers at Gap brand.","Operator","We will go next to Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer & Company.","Anna Andreeva","Just on guidance for implied down earnings for the fourth quarter. Can you talk about if this is based on what you're seeing so far in November, or is this is a more conservative stance ahead of the holiday? And on the gross margin, the implied decline I guess in the range of 100 basis points, give or take, you guys have an easier comparison. Just trying to understand what is driving that degradation, given inventories are clean, and, Glenn, you sound more encouraged about the product at the Gap division.","Sabrina Simmons","Yeah, with regard to guidance, I would say we just saw that prudent given performance year-to-date to be grounded in that performance. And so the basis for the guidance is really our year-to-date performance in sales and comp. And then as I said, it also assumes Gap brand doesn't have any meaningful change in trend from what we've seen year-to-date. I would add to that comment, as I said in my remarks, the fact that in Q4 we really expect more foreign exchange headwinds than we did in Q3 as well. If you think about the yen alone, the average rate was about 105 in Q3. And as of today, it's about 118, which is a 12% depreciation. So that's an importance piece to keep in mind as well.","Operator","And we will go next to Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Chen","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the potential shipping benefit, Glenn, I think you alluded to earlier. We have also noticed that the brand started to test a lot more of the two-day shipping, which we expect shoppers to probably welcome. Can you talk to us about any initial learnings on the receptivity of the two-day shipping program and any quantification on what the potential savings could be for 2015?","Glenn Murphy","I think this is all part of what I could call a longer-term plan under this definition. It's not a well marketed theme, but it's called seamless inventory for us. So how we've learned to get to this point, to the decision we made in our New York store distribution facility is China today runs in a seamless inventory, where the inventory for online customers and for stores are in the same building. As a matter of fact, the step to purity on this trend is on the shelf in the same building.","Athleta runs this way. Japan runs right now not on the same shelf, but in the same building. And we just changed our situation in Europe about six months ago where we had a separate online building and we consolidated that into the store distribution center. So I think we've been thoughtful about going around the US and trying to get some learnings. And so far, it's what you want to get from this. Can you save money over time? The answer should be yes. But the real benefit here is the benefit on gross margin dollars basically sending a unit to, let's call it for now, the highest bidder, who will pay the highest AUR. That could be an online customer or could be a store that's exhibiting stronger AUR performance. And I think that's what seamless inventory eventually gets at.","What we did the distribution center in New York, we had some excess capacity. Right now, we ship to online customers from Columbus and from Phoenix. As delivery time has become more of a table stakes, we decided to use some of that capacity in New York, but it's all part of the strategic direction on seamless, and we popped up about 300,000 square feet of online inventory in that distribution. We own the land. It wasn't that costly. So just put the IT system and we are actually shipping to Eastern side of the country from New York down to Florida, we're shipping out of the New York, D.C.","So could we get some benefit in terms of expense? We hope so. It's really more about expediting and trying to do some of the two-day events you talked about. That's the answer, because coming into Q4, we're trying to find a better balance between our value proposition, also known as promotions, and our service proposition, driven by delivery opportunities and also driven by omni-channel.","So how was the twp-day free gone? I think we're pleased with that. We're pleased with it as long as the incremental cost of the expense of doing that is more than made up by the benefit of gross margin, because we're going to continue the same depth of discount and then go to two day, well, that's not a smart decision. So far, I think customers and we're obviously excited about. As a company that owns brands, we'd rather have a better balance of our value proposition to our service offering. And you're seeing us putting some of that forward and even more of that will happen in Q4.","Operator","We will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","My question is on e-commerce. Sabrina, I just wanted to clarify, does your guidance imply that the negative-1% comp that we saw here in the third quarter continues into Q4, or were you not that specific? And, Glenn, I just wanted to ask about e-commerce. The e-commerce strategies and the digital strategies of this company have been really compelling here for a number of years. We're seeing a pretty big slowdown in e-commerce sales growth here in 2014, and I think the growth rate here in the third quarter was only about 5%. So is it simply product that is holding back the growth rate in e-commerce, or is there something else going on that's making it more difficult to grow that business over time?","Sabrina Simmons","I'll just start with a clarification, Kimberly. It is a range. So I would say that the range is kind of grounded on this year-to-date trend that yes we have seen a negative-1% year-to-date comp and a plus-1% sales. But you can get to numbers within that range with different configurations. But I would say, yes, it's grounded in that notion.","Glenn Murphy","And on the 5% growth in the third quarter, part of my opening comments was we had some accomplishments in the quarter. There were some areas we were disappointed. That was clearly a disappointment. It's a little bit about product. Last year we had a 20% comp, which I think was a pretty strong growth, market leading, but something we should be doing, given the investments we're making. So a two-year 25%, we were not happy with that at all. And the team is very focused. And omni-channel initiatives are not all about driving online sales. Matter of fact, in some cases, reserve in store and order in store to drive more productivity inside our physical assets, but I completely agree with you Kimberly, and I know that brand presidents supported by Art have had lots of conversations about that particular 5% growth.","We gained share in Q3 of 2013 and we gave up some of it in Q3 of 2014. And we're not into the borrowing share business. We're into the gaining share and keeping it. So I think that we're not happy about. I think it's a quarter. I agree with you, this year has kind of slowed down as well, but this was a particular quarter where we're not happy. And I think we're on it and some changes we made to make sure we get back to gaining share online.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","One quick clarification question, Sabrina, is the one-time tax benefit and the asset sale in the second quarter both included in guidance for the full year?","Sabrina Simmons","Yeah, they absolutely are, and that's GAAP guidance. And the full year tax rate, as I said, Matt, has come down slightly from 38.5% to 38% to reflect the benefit of the Q3 non-recurring issue.","Matt McClintock","And then if I may ask a longer-term question, Glenn, as we look into the holiday season, it sounds like there's optimism for some of the e-commerce initiatives order in store, et cetera, to potentially benefit and drive holiday sales. Are you planning for any benefit from these initiatives, as you start your plans for holiday? And then now that you're rolling out order in store to over 1,000 locations, could you maybe give us some update on what you're seeing in terms of what you've seen in the benefit, how that's impacting sales in those stores?","Glenn Murphy","I'd say, Matt, that we didn't plan for any of it, because we just turned the switch on to the 1,000 stores on, I guess, it was in the first day of the new quarter. So we worked our way from 10 stores to 50 stores to a couple of hundred. And then we made a big leap. Art's team did from just around 250 to 1,000 almost overnight, because we had everything set up and the technology was working. So our stores actually have been trained well before that. They were ready to go. They're excited about it. Here're the benefits as far as I can tell.","Numbers that I've given internally and I think externally before are something like this, on average, in the apparel business, conversion is around 30%, which means that 70% of your customers that do not convert in that 70%, there's about 10 points of people who come in and can't find what they want. Purchase intent high, but unable to find, and now that could be in somebody else's hands, it could be in the fitting room, it could be in something in the retail business called the go-backs product that people did not decide to go with it, but to put back on to the shelf or could be and the highest percent of that is we just don't have that item in that size or color in the store.","So order in store is intended to change the paradigm of the conversation that's been going on for multiple generations, which is can I get this in a size 8 and our natural answer is I'm sorry. While we could go to the phone and that takes about eight minutes to do, a charge sent from another store. So what's been developed by Art's team is this amazing way to instantaneously change the conversation from we don't have it, but I can get it for you, and our team is really, you'll see through the holiday season, have been retrained and thinking about that is the conversation, close the sale.","So actually I'm pretty excited about it. I'm still excited about reserve in store. I think order in store has always been on our roadmap that can add more potential than reserve in store. So I think going forward, not for this holiday season, but in the new year the real opportunity of that also is if you look at a fleet of Old Navy with 1,000 stores, there's about 25 what I call fly ship and signature stores. They have the full assortment. Well, now the other 1,000 stores, customers in those locations can see the full assortment, because our team will continue to be trained to say, I know you saw that or you read about it, it's not available in the store, but I can get it for you.","The first orders to the DC, 90% of the product is going to come from our online distribution channel, but some could come from another store. Exposing the full assortment to a customer at a physical location I think is a huge opportunity for this business in the new year. I know Art is seeing how the innovation, the development came from his team that he runs now the digital area.","Operator","We'll go next to Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga","Sabrina, could we get a little bit more color on the reduction in CapEx either in terms of what the projects that might be canceled and\/or delayed or reevaluated? Would you say, if there are delays that they delayed more kind of indefinitely, or just will we see another bump-up in next year's CapEx to make for that reduction?","Sabrina Simmons","Zooming out philosophically, it's just important to say, because we're strong believers in managing the ROIC. We just feel it's very important that if our outlook in earnings is coming down that we should be revising the amount of capital spend we have in a year. And so at the highest level, we felt like with the earnings guidance coming down, it was important to re-look at capital. And that's why we're cropping it back a bit.","With regard to where it's coming from, it is primarily coming from Gap, because we also want to reward the businesses that are delivering return, and we look to crop back those where we are not getting return in the short term. Obviously we never want to do anything that damages our long-term strategies. So all of our growth areas, our growth initiatives, growth in China, our omni-channel, all of that is moving forward as planned. But we did crop back primarily Gap brand and primarily in the area of stores. Store remodels is where we've cropped it back and we'll be revisiting the importance of that in 2015 in terms of whether it becomes an incremental spend or whether it's just out.","Operator","We'll go next to Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner","I wondered, Glenn, you gave some thoughts, I think, about what categories in a larger sense are working at Gap brand. I wondered if you could drill down a little bit in terms of third quarter tops and bottoms, men's and women's, are there things within those categories that are working outside of the big buckets that you mentioned earlier?","Glenn Murphy","The theme is pretty much the same as we've said in the first half of the year. We went to the third quarter still not happy with our women's business and it's important that we continue to try to grow upon it, especially when it comes to the aesthetic. But the point I was making earlier is even though everything starts with design aesthetic, if the product is assertive in categories that have natural growth, then that's also the job of a great merchant beyond just what the design team provides.","We've had a tough year like so many others on just indigo five-pocket denims. We reward people quite a bit here in the merchant side and the inventory management side that turn that inventory down and to change the assortment we have. So thank God, we went to one tool in our tool set that helps us with response from supply chain, and that's vendor managed inventory. If we didn't have that, which we should have had, to be honest with you, a number of years ago when we've had it fully working for 12 months, that allowed us very quickly to turn off the tap of inventory on five-pocket denim and switching to not other denim, although we are seeing some performance across the total business on our fashion denims, especially in distressed, but we just switched that into pants.","So I think that when you're invested in bottoms the way we're across our entire businesses, when you're invested in Gap in denim and indigo denim, the ability to be faster than we've been before and we're not going to set any land speed records today, although we are getting faster and I know under Art's leadership, we plan to get even faster in 2015. But we have to use some of these tools to adjust the assortment.","What I was trying to say it's a Gap brand for sure, but definitely there is a Gap brand component to this in The Gap Inc. I think we've done some much better work this year beyond the aesthetic to really understand where the growth is. And a lot of this, Dorothy, gets validated when we look at the department store results, but we always study about what's working, that is our best chance besides our market data we have and the customer research we do is to get a sense of what's working in Macy's, what's working in Nordstrom. So the fact that we have put more inventory to active outerwear, accessories, at Gap, at Old Navy and baby, and we find a better balance between our definition of fashion product or what I call unexpected styles, Gap in particular, you'll see that in the December flow versus what people just expect from us year in, year out, I think all of those shifts have been well executed.","We have a ton of work to do at Gap brand in particular, but I think Old Navy is further ahead of curve, Banana Republic is further ahead of curve. And some of these categories that in the macroenvironment are doing better, I'm glad that we've shifted some inventory, especially starting next week with some of the flow we get in before black Friday, shifting some of the inventory to what we know is actually growing in the total market.","Operator","We'll go next to John Morris with BMO Capital Markets.","John Morris","Glenn, first of all, thank you for all your hard work and congratulations and we look forward to working with Art if he's still listening in. My question for Sabrina. Just rewinding on SG&A, we know that you had sort of walked that increase down a little bit part way through the quarter, quite a big move. Just refresh for us why it was going from about an 8% increase down to where you came in nicely at 3%. But more so the implications for fourth quarter, could there be also a little bit of wiggle room there as well beyond what you had implied with the guidance? I'm wondering if it has to do with maybe pulling back on the marketing spend, and maybe if Glenn can talk a little bit about whether or not this was a decision to pull back evenly across the brands.","Sabrina Simmons","You might recall we've often said that a large part of our expense base, so about 50% of our expense base is related to stores and over half of that is variable to sales. So part of the reason the expense came down, John, is one that we're not happy about, which is just as sales came down to flat, we actually gained more expense savings, given we have a variable chunk of expense to sales. So that's one component.","The second component or the rest of the components were really a combination of old fashioned belt tightening, including savings in areas like bonus and areas like favorability in credit card income. Additionally, we got a little bit of foreign exchange favorability. So just as foreign exchange hurts your sales and hurts your earnings, when you translate to SG&A dollars, it helps your SG&A. So I'd say those were the biggest reasons that Q3 came in better. We have many of the same factors at work in Q4. We're going to continue to manage expenses tightly, but I think the important thing to remember about Q4 is it is our toughest quarter in terms of comparison, because now we are lapping the fact that we saved over $100 million in Q4 of '13 versus Q4 of '12. And we leveraged the 150 basis point. It actually was our lowest percent of sales clearly in the last five years and maybe even beyond that. So it's an extremely low base we're lapping on, which is why again we say clearly we expect to deleverage even as we do our best to manage expenses, as we always do very disciplined.","John Morris","And I didn't know if Glenn wanted to comment on the marketing, if there was a pullback there?","Glenn Murphy","I would say that some of our marketing is booked and planned. It's not like our store expenses has a variable component to it. But I think we're kind of coming into the year, flat to last year as a starting point. And the way Sabrina categorized return on invested capital and the decision to reconsider remodels for Gap, I think we look at marketing the same way. We have to invest where we think we're going to get the best return. So Gap is going to have marketing. We have a new gift guide out, which is doing really well and we feel very good about that. But it's electronic, so those are trade-offs we do. We could have gift guide distributed to our best customers, call it 3 million, 4 million people and that would have cost x per copy.","So thoughtfully we actually put a little bit more money into the digital side of it. It's so far so good. The money we put into it when you have the digital gift guide, which changes every day on Gap, you can actually click on to something you love that'll take you right to our site. So we felt it was more prudent to put a little bit of money behind that choice as opposed to mailing out 4 million copies. So it's those kinds of choices we're making.","We're especially bullish on the marketing quality we're seeing coming out of Old Navy. I think that I'm not translating that to commercial success for anybody on the phone. I'm just saying we're really feeling good about the work they're doing and the quality of content they're putting together, which you'll see some of the new content coming out next Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I was lucky enough to spend time with Stefan last night and saw the full December slate of content and he was excited, I was excited. So they're going to get their fair share of investment, because their business is stronger and their content is very good.","Operator","We will take our final question from Jennifer Davis with Buckingham Research Group.","Jennifer Davis","Sabrina, I was hoping maybe for a little more color, I guess, or clarification around fourth quarter guidance. Can you at least maybe help us in terms of how much gross margin pressure you expect versus SG&A? And then on the third quarter gross margin or merchandise margins, is the credit card income in merchandise margins and how much did that impact merchandise margins?","Sabrina Simmons","Just a reminder, Jennifer, we do have that reclass going on all year in credit card income. So just like previous quarters, we have about $40 million that last year had all been in SG&A of credit card income going up into margin. So that's definitely happened in the third quarter. It'll happen again in the fourth quarter. I would say most of the favorability I talked about previously was really that hit mostly SG&A. A small amount also of favorability went into margins, but mostly SG&A. And then with regard to guidance, we really are trying to keep it high level. I gave you some points on my prepared remarks could be helpful about some of the underlying assumptions.","But again, we just believe in this environment that we've been operating in all year that it's important to be prudent and grounded in what we've experienced year-to-date. So just to refresh a little bit on what I said, because I don't want to get into every single line item of the P&L that definitely that range is grounded in year-to-date trends in sales and comps. And no meaningful improvement in Gap, and I think the big change versus previous quarters, especially as compared to Q3, is the foreign exchange, because the dollar had strengthened considerably against currencies that matter to us, not only the yen, but also the pound and also the Canadian dollar.","So I think those factors taken together against the backdrop this year, that's been not a bullish backdrop for our company and our apparel retailing. We thought that was an appropriate range to set for now.","Katrina O'Connell","Great. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.

Peck - Gap, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As always, Teri and I are very happy to share with you today our Q3 results. We had another strong quarter delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps along with our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin rate expansion. The momentum we're seeing in the business does give us the confidence to again increase our full-year guidance.","Before I dive into the business, however, I do want to acknowledge that this quarter has had significant challenges, ranging from unseasonably warm weather, an unprecedented impact of natural disasters, and horrific events that have impacted our employees and our business. I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank all 135,000 of my co-workers who've been there for our customers, while at the same time contributing tirelessly to their communities. Our hearts and our resources are with those in the communities which have still not fully recovered.","I'm also pleased to share that we protected all of our impacted employees with pay continuity. This is a critical investment in our most important asset, our people. In a moment, I will turn it over to Teri, who will share more details on our Q3 results. But before I do, I would like to reiterate our balanced growth strategy, how it differentiates us from the industry, and how we're continuing to strengthen and sustain that differentiation. And I want to talk about some of the key components of it.","Balanced growth is made up of four pillars. Number one, investing in growth and value in Active; and importantly, in Active, that extends into the performance lifestyle space. Number two, accelerating a large, fast-growing, highly-profitable, and accretive online and mobile business. As we spoke to you in September, we indicated that we were on the path towards that being a $3 billion business. And we are very pleased with the results in terms of continuing to accelerate its growth rate. I'll talk more about that in a moment. Three, continuing to reduce our exposure as a company to traffic-challenged real estate through specialty store rationalization, largely in Gap and Banana Republic brands. And, number four, substantially improving the productivity of the business.","Underpinning balanced growth are Gap, Inc. advantages that are helping us win. First, multiple iconic profitable brands that give us advantaged economics in finding, attracting, activating and retaining customers. Second, the ability to meet our customers where they are and deliver an exceptional experience, whether that is online, on a mobile device, or in our 3,300 stores around the world. Third, leveraging responsive and innovative product creation capabilities to gain market share in loyalty categories. And, fourth, continuing to identify and exploit our scale to drive profitability, growth, and deliver financial consistency.","I want to quickly discuss then our brands, starting with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered another very solid quarter, up against high compares from last year with a continued focus on loyalty categories. Denim was particularly strong, and I want to illustrate what drove the business. The sales comps were in the high teens, and the margin comps were outpacing the sales comps. As of October, Old Navy is the number four retailer in Denim, which is up two spots from LY.","Success has been driven by a number of things, including destruction, color, print, hem treatments and silhouettes that resonated with the customer. But, importantly, it was not just this product success, but it was the fact that Old Navy sits on a highly responsive platform which allows replenishment in this category in 9 to 14 weeks depending on whether we ship it on vessel or we air it. As we continue to get faster, we will continue to see results like this as we reduce the risk associated with buying and holding inventory, and where we can capitalize on demand. And, importantly, we will continue to get faster.","I am also pleased to share that in the last two quarters, we've developed a prototype of a low-scope, low-cost, but highly effective remodel, designed to ensure that even our oldest stores in the Old Navy fleet will always be up to brand standards. These remodels have delivered above their financial expectations and have had a positive customer response driving both top and bottom line performance. Additionally, over the course of the year, we've opened 20 Old Navy stores in North America and expect to have about 1,070 as we exit the year. As well, we are accelerating our new store openings in 2018.","Turning to Athleta. Simply put, Athleta is on fire. Top and bottom line momentum continues. We're seeing exceptional growth outpacing the industry with operating margin expansion. Many things are driving this, but two stand out: back to responsive. 50% of the assortment in the business is on a pipeline of 6 to 11 weeks. This allows us to responsibly buy the initial assortment and then feed units into the business as we see market share opportunities. Second, we're making highly targeted and highly efficient marketing investments focused on customer acquisition, which continues to grow the customer file and continues to accelerate brand awareness.","Q3 was also an important time for the brand, given the importance of back-to-school. And you might ask why back-to-school matters to Athleta, but this was a real test to see the drawing power of the brand with the girl's division now fully expressed in all stores. And we were not disappointed and, importantly, this business has been added with no incremental ROD and minimal expense, making it highly accretive.","On online in Athleta, continuing to grow faster than the industry. We continue to also thoughtfully expand our retail presence opening 7 new stores this quarter and about 15 on the year. We anticipate the total size of the fleet to be about 150 stores as we exit 2017, and we'll continue to open new doors into next year.","Turning to our more mature brands, Gap and Banana Republic. The teams continue to be focused on improving performance while leveraging Gap, Inc.'s capabilities to deliver innovation and on-trend product in loyalty categories.","Starting with Gap, the most important news is again progress quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, we beat industry traffic during most weeks due to high returning marketing investments and we also maintained healthy AUR's as we've anniversaried the Fishkill fire. We have more work to do, more progress to be made and we're not celebrating success. But the fact that we are seeing consistent quarter-over-quarter improvement makes me pleased with the results and the work that the team is doing and the consistency in execution.","In Banana Republic, the team is focused on the right priorities, but there's a lot of heavy lifting to do to improve performance. Right now, we're executing behind our product pillars, which translate into loyalty for the brand. And as a reminder, the core of these are pants, suitings, sweaters and outerwear; things that customers expect from Banana Republic, come to Banana Republic for, and are loyal to the brand for.","With holiday ahead, I'm particularly excited to see traction in the sweaters business through improved product acceptance and better investment. Every quarter this year as well, Banana has been narrowing their spread to industry traffic, with Q3 demonstrating continued improvement with a slight beat to the industry. When you couple that with the positive sales, less traffic, it's quite clear that we're attracting more qualified footsteps and the customer is taking out their wallet and spending. Again, lots to do. I want to acknowledge the team is focused on the right areas and making progress.","If you recall from my comments back in September, a key focus for both teams in both businesses is getting each business back to a level of profitability that we've seen quite recently. We're confident about the progress and confident about the work being done, and anxious to continue to see the results improve.","Now, I'd like to spend a moment on productivity. First, we continue to make progress towards our announced store closure plan, with a healthy portion of our plan closures now closing by year-end in 2017. We also anticipate delivering on our initial planned closures by the end of 2018, which will be a year ahead of our original expectations. We've looked at these stores through the lens of profitability and through the lens of their long-term potential. We are making tough calls to ensure our fleet represents our brands and we are in the appropriate centers.","As we rationalize our specialty footprint, we're also taking the opportunity to drive a more efficient and profitable operating model for Banana. We announced earlier this week that we're moving our New York-based Banana Republic teams to San Francisco. This consolidation with the rest of the brand will improve speed, it will improve quality, and it will save cost. You will continue to hear from us on productivity each quarter going forward. I wanted to share with you, however, a few of these steps that we've taken already.","Let me close with some comments on the investments we've been making and we'll continue to make to drive growth. Over the past six months, brand health and customer acquisition have been critical focuses for every business. We've accelerated the growth of our customer file database to the mid-single digits from negative, helping drive our online and mobile businesses to grow in the high teens in Q3. Additionally, if you look at our online business, from Q3 of 2016 we have seen an acceleration of the growth rate in each quarter, quarter on quarter on quarter.","These investments are also driving multi-channel behavior with all of our brands beating industry store traffic in Q3. This marks the third consecutive quarter for a traffic beat for Gap and Old Navy and the first for Banana Republic. This is an important and excellent improvement compared to where we were even a year ago.","We've also continued to build on our features and functionality and capability in our web and app-based technologies to improve the customer experience. Also, as we've had Ship from Store, Find in Store and Reserve in Store for several years now, this quarter we've added Buy Online and Pick Up in Store to two markets, Chicago and San Francisco. It is early days, but we're extremely encouraged by the results so far.","Beyond online and mobile, our multi-tender loyalty program, BRIGHT Rewards, is now live at Old Navy in Dallas and Atlanta. Customers are heavily engaged so far. With the test stores, we've seen a 2x lift in the number of customers we're able to contact versus our card-based rewards program. This is an exciting step forward to be able to reach our engaged non-card holding customer and offer her a tiered version of our rewards offering.","As we look to holiday, we will continue to invest in our brands and channels in the form of marketing, digital and store payroll to drive growth. Our performance year-to-date has given us confidence that this is the right thing to do and the right time to do it.","In closing, let me reiterate our focus on balanced growth, combining growth and value in Active, accelerating online and mobile, rationalizing specialty, while driving productivity improvements through scale and leverage. We are driving this from a platform that is much stronger today than just a few years ago, and I'm pleased that we are delivering consistent performance this year as the foundation for future growth.","Teri?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Thanks, Art, and good afternoon. As Art said, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of positive results while also making progress against the balanced growth strategy we outlined in September. As you also heard from Art, as part of that strategy, we're accelerating our store closure plans and now expect to complete the initially identified closures by the end of 2018. Additionally, we have and will continue to identify opportunities to leverage our scale and simplify our operating model. We'll continue to update you on this work as we progress.","Turning now to the third quarter performance, and starting with sales. Comp sales were up 3%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. Net sales for the quarter were $3.8 billion, a 1% increase from last year. The spread between net sales and comp sales is largely due to our international closures last year.","We're very pleased to deliver another quarter of positive comp and net sales growth despite the negative impact from the hurricanes we experienced throughout the quarter, as well as the warmer-than-expected weather. Just for reference, as a result of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, a combined total of 277 stores were closed for an average of approximately six days during the third quarter.","Looking at the brand level, Old Navy delivered a positive 4% comp against a positive 4% comp last year. The last year comp excludes the negative impact of about 1 point from the Fishkill fire. Similar to the first half, Old Navy's results were driven by broad-based category strength.","Continuing its sequential improvement throughout the year, the Gap brand comp was positive 1%, driven by improved traffic and conversion. This is against the negative 4% comp last year, again, excluding the negative impact of the Fishkill fire which was about 4 points.","At Banana Republic, comp sales were down 1% against the negative 6% last year. This excludes the negative impact of the Fishkill fire of about 2 points. The men's business continues to be more consistent while, as Art mentioned, the women's business has more work to do. We feel good about continued traction in our pillar categories.","It's worth noting that all brands outpaced industry traffic for the quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter that Gap and Old Navy traffic outpaced the industry. We attribute this strength to improved and more consistent advertising. Additionally, we were pleased to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive AUR.","Moving on to gross margin. When excluding the 2016 restructuring costs, our third quarter gross margin was up 60 basis points from last year to 39.7%. Excluding the restructuring costs from 2016, merch margin was about flat to last year. Our rent and occupancy leveraged 60 basis points, primarily driven by our positive comp sales.","With regard to Fishkill, as we noted on our second quarter call, we had expected business interruption insurance recovery of about $0.08 to $0.09 in the second half of the year. During the third quarter, we received about $0.03 of this recovery. As a reminder, these proceeds are intended to offset elevated logistics costs we've been incurring throughout the year. Our current expectation is to receive the remaining 2017 business interruption proceeds in the fourth quarter.","Regarding SG&A, our third quarter total operating expenses came in largely as expected at $1.1 billion, up about $80 million when compared to 2016 adjusted operating expenses. Similar to the first half, the increase was primarily driven by payroll-related expenses largely due to bonus accruals. We also saw an increase in investments to support the business, namely marketing and resources added to support our customer and digital efforts.","Our third quarter tax rate benefited from favorable changes in the tax impact of foreign operations resulting in a tax rate of 37.1% and about $0.02 of EPS favorability in the third quarter. We now expect a full year effective tax rate of about 38%.","Our third quarter earnings per share were $0.58, compared to an adjusted $0.60 in Q3 of 2016. FX negatively impacted third quarter EPS by an estimated $0.02, bringing us to flat year-over-year.","Regarding cash flow, year-to-date, our free cash flow was $197 million which includes approximately $60 million of insurance proceeds related to property and equipment. The timing of lease payments and the increase in inventories since the end of last fiscal year resulted in lower free cash flow versus last year. We ended the quarter with $1.35 billion of cash.","Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we completed an additional $100 million of share repurchase in Q3. In line with our year-to-date cadence, we plan to repurchase an additional $100 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with 389 million shares outstanding, and year-to-date we paid dividends of $272 million.","Regarding inventory, we ended the quarter with inventory up 3% compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase in inventory is primarily due to the timing of in-transit and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $463 million, consistent with our expectations. And on a net basis, we've closed seven company-operated stores year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,193 stores. With our acceleration of store closures, we now expect about 30 closures on a net basis in fiscal 2017.","Now, with regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, including the impact of the expected lower effective tax rate, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.12, excluding $0.10 of insurance proceeds that we received in quarter two.","Let me spend a minute on SG&A for the fourth quarter. We now expect the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter SG&A to be at about the same pace of increase we've seen year-to-date. There are a couple of factors that are impacting fourth quarter SG&A versus our prior expectations.","First, we now expect marketing spending to increase in the fourth quarter when compared to year-to-date trends. This is largely due to the fact that we had some production costs move out of Q3 and into Q4. But we're also planning some incremental spend, largely digital, to support the momentum we are seeing in the business during the important holiday season. As I noted, we've been pleased with our improved traffic trends, which we believe are driven in part by better and more consisting marketing.","Given the positive results we've seen this year, we believe this incremental marketing investment will help us better execute during the important holiday season. Second, we expect higher variable store-related costs associated with our objective of continuing to improve the customer experience. And, lastly, we continue to exceed our internal goals and, therefore, we expect higher bonus accruals in the fourth quarter.","We believe the investments we're making are supporting our balanced growth strategy. And as you've heard from us today, we're going to take the actions to fund these investments in the future by driving productivity across the company. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain unchanged.","So, in closing, overall, we are very pleased with the solid results in the third quarter, especially given the tough compares we were up against and some of the events during the quarter. I'm also pleased with the progress we're making against our balanced growth strategy. I'm energized by the plans and initial actions we're taking against the productivity goals we laid out in September. The fourth quarter is an important one, and we're pleased to enter the peak period with strengthened brands, improved product and the operational discipline to deliver in a challenging environment.","Jennifer Fall - Gap, Inc.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So on the gross margin, what was the performance by concept that comprised the flat merchandise margin? And, I guess, how best to think about merchandise margin opportunity in the fourth quarter? And then, finally, just what comp is needed to leverage occupancy from here, given the great performance this quarter?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Okay. I'll start with the last one and I'll try to remember all the questions you asked, Matt. We've, historically, said we need a low-single digit to mid-single digit comp to be able to leverage ROD. I mean that's really what you saw this quarter was we got that and you saw it come through in the leverage.","On the margin question, we don't get into as much detail as you would like us to. But I can say as we look across the quarter, there were no significant outliers in what we saw. So we're seeing about what we expected. And we will remain focused on the AUR expansion that's helped drive some of the fundamentals we've seen this year as we go into the fourth quarter. The only challenge, of course, is that the fourth quarter historically is more promotional. And so, you're going to see that in the absolute rates. But we are very comfortable with the healthy margins across the brands.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Teri, I guess, this question is for you. On the store closures, it sounds like you moved them up by a year. 30 net closures for this year. How many of the 200 stores that you've laid out previously is incorporated in whatever took place in Q3 and your plan for Q4?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","This is how I will answer it, is the 200-store closure that we laid out is split between what we will accomplish over the fourth quarter, which is an acceleration, and then spread out over next year. And, as you said, that is an acceleration of about a year. We're going through the list of store closures now and finalizing the plans of the timing and how we will manage through those. But, net-net, we feel very confident that the acceleration this year and what we have planned for next year will take us to the finish line there.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So maybe just another way, is there a way we should be thinking about your net footage next year after all the store closure initiative takes place?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yes. We haven't gotten to that level of detail publicly.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes. I would just say that, as you can imagine, this is a delicate dance that we're doing with our landlords, and there's a fair amount of negotiation going on right now. And so, as we start to harden this down, we'll certainly share the relevant and appropriate details. But we're up to our eyeballs right now in the midst of what is a really constructive dialogue as we're working our way through this.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Art.","Operator","And our next question is from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. I was curious on the marketing spend. Can you maybe just give us some perspective by division sort of what's happening year-over-year and how maybe you're thinking about where marketing investment should go next year?","And then, second question, on the fabric platforming that you've talked about before, obviously, you've given us a sense of where Old Navy is, but maybe give us an update on Gap and Banana, sort of where are they relative to Old Navy on your viewpoint on the fabric platforming?","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes. Sorry, and what was the \u2013 I was listening then to the second question and it flushed the first one out. Can you go back on that again?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Advertising.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Advertising.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, advertising by division.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I don't want to go to the specifics here. I'd say the most important themes are, is that we're continuing to move the mix towards a variety of forms of advertising, probably more away from the traditional print, et cetera. And, again, pivoting much more heavily into digital where we can look at line of sight, we can get a clear measure of our ROAS and make intelligent calculations about how far down the ROAS curve we want to spend. And that's probably the biggest change that we're continuing to implement across all the businesses.","We had very strong focus on two components, which is: filling the funnel with new customers, and that is a consistent focus across the entire business; and then reactivating and increasing the frequency of last customers or current customers. And we're seeing excellent traction, to be honest, across all of those as we've gotten more focused and we've managed the mix.","I don't want to put a pin in at the level. But what I can tell you is, is that when we see the returns, which we are, and most importantly they manifest themselves in terms of the accelerating growth rate online on one side and our beat to industry traffic on the other, we're going to continue to spend where we know that that dollar spend brings us back a multiple. It's just good business. And then, on the other side...","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Fabric platforming.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Fabric platforming. Yes. I mean, if I rank them, what I would say is, Athleta is probably the farthest along. And, again, it's our smallest business. And they've really gone after it with a vengeance. And we're absolutely seeing business outcomes, as I noted, associated with their ability to be highly responsive. And I would just, again, point out the fact that as much as I'm giving you more specific numbers now and, again, oftentimes the spread is whether we air it or put it on vessel in the ocean, we're continuing to look at ways to continue to get faster right now. And sometimes it's how to receive faster, how do we get it to our DCs faster, do we start doing some direct vendor-to-store deliveries, that kind of thing, because we're seeing absolutely consistent outcomes, excellent business outcomes associated with the speed.","If I rank order, I'd put Athleta first, I'd probably put Old Navy second with Gap close behind, but it's a different business model. And then, it varies category by category. And Banana still has some work to do, but the team there is really heads down on being a super fast follower from what we've seen in other parts of the business.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And good luck for holiday.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura | Instinet.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura | Instinet","Thanks. Good afternoon, and congrats on the nice results, guys. So congrats on that positive comp at Gap. Just recognizing that you were lapping the compare from the fire, any thoughts on the right way to think about the go-forward Gap Global comps into Q4? And then, sorry for the dumb question, just to clarify, when you talk about traffic, is that store level or does it also include online? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I think on Gap, what I'm really looking for here and I noted in my comments is consistent quarter-over-quarter improvement; and we've seen that. And I'm not going to call Q4 right now. I mean, we're two weeks into Q4, et cetera, and I'm not going to call it. But I can look under the covers and see why we're getting that improvement, and that's really what my expectation is of the business that we're going to continue to see. Sorry. Then, the second one was? I'm focused so much on...","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Traffic.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Traffic, yes. It's been a long week already. Traffic. So when I'm talking about industry traffic, that's really looking at physical traffic into our stores. We don't really have the same kind of metrics as they apply to online traffic. We look more there at overall demand and growth rates, but it's just a little looser there. So when I say we've been beating industry traffic, it's really the standard industry traffic measures.","And, again, really nice numbers from Gap and Old Navy pretty consistently, and nice to see Banana then in this quarter get on the bandwagon as well. And the matching formula here is get traffic moving. And then on top of that, sales less traffic, which comes out of your inbox levers around AUR, around conversion, around the size of the basket. And that's the underlying formula that we've got going here now more consistently.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","And I do just want to clarify on the Gap comp compare that we gave you, it is adjusted for Fishkill. So the negative 4% last year is more of a normalized so you can see the progress. The positive 1% is against the normalized negative 4%.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura | Instinet","All right. Perfect. Okay. And then, Teri, just a quick one. Have you \u2013 the 53rd week impact to either sales or EPS, any help there?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yes. We've said it's about $0.05 on the year.","Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura | Instinet","Okay. Great. Thank you. Best of luck for holiday, guys.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participant. Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. Art, back in September, you talked about some SG&A savings opportunities that you see sort of medium-ish term in the business. I'm wondering if you can just put a little more meat on the bone there? And then, I think at the same time you were discussing some SG&A savings opportunities. You were talking about other areas that you would like to invest in. So could you maybe talk about that a little as well? And on balance, do you think there will be some net SG&A savings? Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes. So I know you want more detail, because I've heard this question in different forms several times and I fully appreciate that. At the moment, I'm probably going to frustrate you a little bit, but answer you back a little bit more with the process of how we're approaching it rather than the specifics. And the way I would characterize the difference is that we and many others have often approached cost reduction on an episodic big bang basis. And we and many others have had less success with that sticking and really getting efficiency and productivity in the organization than we should; and then, we will.","And so, this is different. We are taking, as I noted, the restructuring of the Banana headquarter structure, accelerating some of our stores and then there are bits and pieces around the organization. We are taking some of those actions right now. But we're also really approaching this as an ongoing, focused, highly-managed productivity initiative that, quite honestly, as I said in September, I anticipate this is going to live for several years and become part of our culture of how we do business. And that has not really been as much of the culture as it needs to be.","On the investment side, I would note the things that Teri already called out, where we feel that we have an opportunity to differentiate whether it's through customer acquisition or our in-store experience. I would also call out the fact that we are continuing to invest in the underlying capabilities in fulfillment in our distribution centers.","And I've talked about some of that before where we are investing in leveraging existing building capacity in our retail DCs to be able to fulfill direct orders out of those DCs as well. And that really is meeting the continuing and accelerating demand that we're seeing in our online space. And that's a big part of it. There's technology investment and there are other pieces as well. But that's an important customer-facing piece.","Like I said, we'll talk about productivity, but it's going to be a continuing conversation as we identify opportunities. If and when we come up with an opportunity to say we're going to take a one-time by bundling things together, you'll be the first to know that as well. But we're in the middle of the work that we're doing right now, and we still have more work to do.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, Art.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, and congrats on seeing improvements in the business. Couple of questions on the Gap division. Art, maybe what is your view on the product content right now and talk about what you're most excited for the holiday? And just a follow-up to the 4Q guide, the SG&A growth rate implied pretty big improvement in the gross margin. Maybe talk about what's driving that acceleration. How do you guys think about the promotional stance into 4Q? Thanks so much.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Okay. I think I heard it. You got very faint in the second one. So if I'm off-track, just stop me and correct me. On the first one on Gap, what am I most excited about? Again, I'd say consistency in period-over-period improvement. If I dig inside of what's going on, we're seeing good traction in the bottoms business in women's, which is always an important place to see traction with denim really delivering right now. And our denim platform in Gap is responsive, and so able to put units back into the business. Super solid traction also there in the Active and in the performance lifestyle space. Excellent traction in GapBody.","And we've just opened a couple of stores now, one in the adjacent space in the Banana Republic store on Broadway in Soho where GapBody Love is being expressed. And we feel there's a real opportunity here starting with product, where we're very much on trend in the product space in that concept and we're seeing excellent traction there as well. And then to deliver the numbers that we delivered, you have to have decent progress across the whole business at the end of the day. But those are some of the highlights that I would call out.","On gross margin, it's a composite of things. It's obviously product acceptance, which comes from the work that we've been doing now for several years on continuing to develop an assortment that is on trend, that is properly bought, that has the appropriate quality and the appropriate fit, and do that consistently season over season. And our customers are registering that and responding to it.","And that's the, first and foremost, most important lever to beginning to get our yields up and back off of promotion, is the right product properly bought. And, again, that's a lot of the work that I've been talking about now for a couple years with all of you. And we're starting to see business outcomes associated with doing that.","Where we are putting innovation into the product, we're also seeing that the customer is very much willing to pay for it. And Athleta is an excellent example of that being a very high-rate price business with everything in its assortment, whether it's lifestyle or performance, having elements of innovation. But we are seeing that pay off, frankly, across all of our businesses.","Banana introduced the Rapid Movement Chino couple of months ago, and it's been a blowout winner with men in what it delivers, which is, stretch, comfort, performance, and then stain management, water resistance as well, all in a great-fitting, great-looking, pretty good classic chino pant. And he's responding to that and he's willing to pull out his wallet and pay for it.","I could go on and on about this, but it's really all of those things. If it was one giant lever that we successfully pulled, I'd actually be worried. If it is the product of the diversified focus across better product, a better experience, product innovation, et cetera, plus traffic, yes, I'd get pretty excited about that because that's the winning formula that sits on a solid platform.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. Best of luck.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Art, you've delineated the idea of performance lifestyle a couple times on this conference call. I know you highlighted the Rapid Movement Chino. But, I guess, how big is the opportunity for performance lifestyle? And how should we think about the banner opportunity and where you think you can drive the most amount of business? Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","What I would tell you is that as we continue to bring innovation, technical innovation that delivers comfort, care characteristics, Active performance features, we continue to see the customer respond when we bring that into ready-to-wear fabrications. And so, I'm not going to call how high is high here, but we're very encouraged across all of our brands as we've continued to do this and see the customer respond.","And it's super interesting because it's just as relevant in a men's casual beach short as it is in a men's Italian wool suiting that might happen to have stretch in it, or coming down the road that is washable rather than having to take it to a dry cleaner. And that's actually a meaningful benefit for a man and a woman, in that you save a lot of money and there's a big convenience factor associated with being able to launder yourself.","So as I talk about performance lifestyle, it's really in some respects sort of the reinvention of some of these ready-to-wear categories, drawing on the best of the Active and performance space, but expressing it in traditional silhouettes and traditional fabrications in the ready-to-wear space. And it's a place where we don't see it happening, frankly, a lot. There are some very small brands out there that are playing around with it. We think we are one of the few, actually, doing it at the mass and scale level, and it's been very encouraging so far to see how the customer is responding to this.","I mean just to state the obvious, it's important that this product be attractive, be occasion-appropriate, not be weird, not be techy, not be crunchy, but be a kind of product that you can wear as a traditional product maybe to work or a social occasion, but also delivers performance attributes. And that's kind of the magic where we really see the unlock and where the customer's really responding.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question is from Chethan Mallela with Barclays.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good evening. So in September when you provided detail on the margin profile by banner, I believe you disclosed that Gap brand had a very low-single digit operating margin in 2016 and recognized that FX has been the headwind that can reverse and some of the planned store closure activity could also help future profitability. But can you talk about other key unlocks that are specific to the Gap brand? And then, just as a follow-up, what you see as a more sustainable for that banner over time?","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I'm indexing my expectations and the team will tell you, my knee in their back in terms of improvement off of how the brand performed relatively recently. Some of it under my time when I was actually running the brand. And so, without revealing the number, I can tell you that we have seen a performance that is significantly better than what we're seeing most recently.","And the reason that's important for me, just to be clear, is that we can all acknowledge the secular trend surrounding the industry and those kinds of things and interpret those to mean whatever they mean. As I've said before, I view this as money we have lost and, therefore, money that is recoverable. And that's the work that we're doing right now. And so, I don't want to go into it right now because then I'll set expectations, et cetera. But it's definitely something that both Banana and Gap were looking at and, again, indexing expectations back on recent performance.","If I say where should it come from with respect to Gap, it's kind of all of the above. Clearly, FX has put pressure on the business and we've delineated that. We have some store closures that we're doing, which will help as well. But it starts by, frankly, fundamentally continuing to make the product better, to get our yields up, to get our promotional intensity down and to manage the cost structure inside of the business. And those are all things that we're working aggressively on.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Art, in your prepared remarks you mentioned an Old Navy remodel. Could you give a little bit more detail: A, on what that's all about: and, B, how you're thinking about rolling it out? And then, just a quick housekeeping one for Teri. The $0.03 from the Fishkill recovery, can you confirm is that flowing through cost of goods this quarter or some other part of the P&L? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes. Let me talk about the remodel. And the reason I'm calling this out is that we have a lot of stores in the Old Navy fleet that are still the original fitment. We call them the old Old Navy's. And you would recognize them with the circus like signs and a supermarket type cash register, booth sets that have been around for a while, et cetera. And they're typically very productive stores for us in locations that customers are still shopping in, but they look their age and maybe don't merit a full gut remodel.","So we've gone in and we've done the relatively simple and the relatively low-cost things, typically starting with paint. Oftentimes, we'll paint the fixtures, redo the lighting, perhaps remodel the cash-wrap. Sometimes we'll even shrink the store down because perhaps it's too large. And so, we'll build a false wall at the back to tighten up the store and make it feel a little bit more intimate.","And we've been rolling those out now with some tests before we pulled the trigger on deciding to go bigger. And we really found that the customer response and, first and foremost, oftentimes they will say is this all new product because it's displayed in an environment that is fresher and more respectful.","And as I said, we're seeing the top line lift and the bottom line lift. And so, it's very encouraging to us. And we've got a bunch of those in the system right now and we feel like our customers deserve and our product is so exceptional that it deserves a clean fresh stage, and that's really what we're doing. And it's encouraging to see the economics that come with it.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yeah. On the housekeeping matter, Lindsay, the $0.03 is in cost of goods sold. It offsets the logistics cost.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Art, just you mentioned you have a bunch of the remodels in the system and you're seeing a top and bottom line lift. Can you quantify any of that, maybe order of magnitude, what kind of top line lift or order of magnitude how many of these remodels you've done already and how many you plan to do in 2018?","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Well, we've done more than a handful, I would say, right now. And I honestly don't have the numbers in front of me in terms of 2018. What I can tell you is that the returns on the expense, which is relatively modest, or the CapEx is quite good. So it allows us to put this down. But I don't know the exact number right now, Lindsay. I'm sorry about that.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yes. Over the course of 2017, we'll have north of 100 remodels completed, largely Old Navy, but a couple of similar approaches at Gap and Banana.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about speed, what needs to happen to get faster? When does it happen? Is it a different pace for the different brands? And what does it mean in terms of inventory and gross margin?","Just quickly on the second thing, with the high-teens comps in denim in Old Navy, which is very impressive, how can the learnings from Old Navy perhaps be incorporated into the Gap division to improve their performance in denim? Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","There's nobody I would've expected more than you, Dana, to ask about speed and you delivered that question quite rapidly. So congratulations.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you. Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","This is one and I know my responses on this continue to probably frustrate simply because there isn't a macro answer that makes any sense. The averages here confuse, because it is category by category, brand by brand. As to how fast we can be, we are in places now constrained not by our design process and our vendors cutting and selling, but by the logistics associated with it, whether it's on vessel or, frankly, getting it into a port and then getting it on rail or on truck and into our DCs and out of our DCs and into our store.","So in some of these categories, it's why I said on the call, we're starting to look at ways to continue to chip a day, a week, whatever, off on some of these things. And, again, I would highlight on denim, it takes nine minutes to make a pair of jeans. And it takes a lot longer obviously from the standpoint of releasing a PO today to actually having that in front of the customer. I'm not predicting we're going to be 3D printing denim in our stores in nine minutes, but we see a continued opportunity here. There's not an endpoint. This is an ongoing journey.","As to leveraging, we are leveraging today as a company better than what I've ever seen, quite honestly. I've mentioned some of this before, but we have converted our sourcing organization to a category-based focus versus having a variety of competing denim offices or knits offices all around the world.","We've significantly rationalized and are now sharing key vendors across the company. In some cases now, we are starting to share key base cloths across the brands that can be treated differently, washed differently, destruction, laser treatment, et cetera. And so, there's a big opportunity in front of us for continuing to share. And then, obviously, sharing in terms of best practices as well, which we're also doing.","And again, I know that on Gap, Gap and Old Navy have been leveraging back and forth. In Gap women's denim, we saw 13% comp and a 22% gross margin comp. And those are really nice numbers. And, again, they happened for a lot of reasons. But part of the reason they happened is because we're increasingly responsive. We're also on trend, we've got good fit, good quality, et cetera, et cetera.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question will come from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So on the lines of focusing on the growth channel, I was hoping you could speak a little bit more specifically to the performance of your mall versus off-mall stores? And any takeaways on the outlet versus non-outlet by division or whatever level of granularity you're willing to share?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yes. The level of granularity we're willing to share is probably a lot less than you would like.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Than you would be willing to take from us.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","We don't get down to mall, non-mall kinds of performance. I think there's no question we have more of our specialty stores in some of the mall-based properties, and some of those are struggling more. So as we rationalize those, those are probably a little more concentrated in the mall base. But I don't know I'd go any further than that.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yes.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Thanks. And maybe just to close out. Art, maybe a softball for you. But just wondered if you can talk about the broader apparel environment and how you're viewing it heading into holiday. I mean, consumers in decent shape, weather seems to helping at the margin, we're lapping the election and some tougher traffic from last November. You've spoken a lot about the controllable things that Gap is focused on, but just wondering what your crystal ball is telling you for the broader industry? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I mean, first of all, in the broader industry, I continue to believe that there is, and there is happening in front of us, a consolidation taking place and that we are poised to win on the back of all of the advantages that we have and all the work that we've been doing, speeding up our product pipeline, innovating, delivering performance, all those things that are happening right now. And so, that's, I think, really important. And I sort of view this as almost regardless of consumer sentiment we've got an opportunity to drive growth and gain market share. My expectation, frankly, of all my businesses and all my business leaders is that we carry the momentum of this quarter into Q4. And everybody is heads down focused on making that happen right now.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Best of luck over holiday.","Teri L.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce your host, Jack Calandra, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations.","Jack Calandra","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap, Inc.'s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements as well as reconciliations and descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 19, 2016, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining me on the call today are CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons. Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Arthur Peck","Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. I want to spend some time on where we are and where the industry is strategically and what we are doing. You'll recall that over a year ago, I spoke to you very directly about the fact that we were not where we needed to be in terms of products, across our brands, and how we needed to bring product to market.","And we have done a great deal of work across the company over the last 12 months-plus to be focused on product, focused on restoring the aesthetic of our brands, quality where is appropriate, consistent fit and a number of elements of product, including building responsive product capabilities.","I am pleased with the work, it is the right work and we will scale this work progressively period-over-period as we go forward. But clearly, we need to do more, faster. And so with that, we've announced several other things that we're going to be taking on with a high degree of urgency. This is an environment that we're operating in today that demands faster change.","We are present today with our global footprint, where apparel dollars are being spent. That said, that is never meant that we will compete in every geography, with every brand and every channel. And I'm a strong believer in this company of trying things, learning from them, making adjustments and moving forward, and doing that with speed and doing that decisively.","As part of this, we have announced that we will be winding down our Old Navy operations in Japan, partly due to the macro factors in that environment and partly due to, frankly, needing to apply the resources to greater and higher potential opportunities. I am obviously disappointed that we're going to be discontinuing operations, but I view it as a sign of a good company, when you acknowledge that the business isn't going to deliver, and you make changes and move forward.","I am so, with respect to Old Navy, very bullish about its global growth opportunity, very excited about the potential that lies in front of that. China has been and will continue to be a key area of focus for the entire company. And so far in Mexico, I've been very pleased with what I've seen as the growth potential and profitability potential there as well.","I'd also want to call out the fact that part of the work that we're doing right now is making sure that we're taking every opportunity to exploit our scale and our mass and our size. We believe very strongly that we have a structural advantage in our North American footprint.","There are other advantages in North America that I want to make sure that we're fully exploring. Whether these are supply chain, logistics, our mobile and web presence, our CRM opportunity, all coupled with our product engine, which I believe form a potent formula for winning in North America.","There is a tremendous CRM opportunity here. And when I say CRM, I really mean the opportunity to know our customers holistically and increasingly communicate with them as individuals and personalize their experience.","We also have an opportunity, if I go back to mobile for a second, to move towards truly leveraging mobile traffic that we're getting on our website and continue to get towards a fully responsive, deep, integrated, super-efficient mobile web experience.","These are all advantages that in our core North American market, we have, we can see them, we can exploit them, but we haven't pushed fully down that path. They are not unrepresented in our other markets as well, but with our home market being North America, they are powerful in terms of where we have structural advantage.","So I want to highlight two words, and I've mentioned these now frequently inside the company, and I just want to underline them for this conversation. One is acceleration and the other is distortion. They are both critically important. One is about moving faster on a broader front, and the other is about aligning our energy against fewer things, deeper and better.","Acceleration is about the change that we've already been embarking on as a company, but pushing harder and pushing faster. We have an opportunity to tighten up our operating model to accelerate that change, in order to be more nimble, to operate faster and to be more efficient at the same time. And I intend that we will take advantage of every opportunity there as well and accelerate the change that we're making.","I also used the word, distort. And what it means to me is to make sure that our energy, our resources, our investment, our talent, our push towards places where we can win, where we can create advantage that is meaningful in our economics and advantages for our customers and win.","So what's a good example of that? Our presence in active today. It's a big business for us. We're one of the largest players in active in North America today. And it's an opportunity to continue to build the business, to participate in the highest growth segment of the apparel space. And then bring our scale, our mask and our capabilities to bear in technical innovation, in fabrication, in design and in trend, bring those to bear not just in our active business, but on behalf of our entire ready-to-wear portfolio.","Let me come back to Q1. Topline and bottomline, unacceptable. We saw traffic volatility over the course of several weeks during the first quarter, and it obviously had a significant impact on demand, on promotional levels and on topline and bottomline. What I am very encouraged about is what we are seeing inside the business and the customers' reaction to the product work that we've been doing over the course of the last year.","Go into a Gap store, look at the product, feel the quality, see the color, the optimism, the consistent fit, really proud of the work that the team has done, and our customers are responding to it. But I started this a year ago, and said, if we don't win at product first, we won't win. And it's clear that we need to do more than product. But I am very pleased with the product work that we have done, and again, how it is showing up in front of our stores.","You've heard me speak to Old Navy before, too much fashion, too much duplication in the assortment. The most important thing to know about Old Navy is the brand proposition, the value proposition is compelling. I am very excited about the team getting the brand back on track. I have zero doubts about how compelling the value proposition is.","Let me speak briefly about Banana for just a moment. Obviously, again, very disappointing comp in that business and we have more work to do to make sure that all of the product in the stores is being brought into the stores through the filters that the brand has put in place. That said, on key item buys, where we have been relentless about quality fit and making sure that it honors the promise of versatility that Banana has always honored, I am seeing some very encouraging results there.","Last, I have not spoken to you much about Athleta, but I would be remiss not to call out the fact that Athleta continues to perform superbly for us, and it is positioned right in the sweet spot of the active space, which is growing faster than the overall rate of apparel. And it's a place where we are fundamentally omni-channel in our structure and very innovative all the way down to the fiber and fabric level in terms of product fabrications. So both as a growth driver in this company, but also as a source of innovation to the rest of our portfolio, I couldn't be happier having Athleta as part of the Gap Inc. family.","Let me close by saying that, again, to me the change that is impacting this industry is obvious. It's been obvious to us for a while, which is why we are moving with urgency against a multi-year plan to modernize this company across many levels. I am very excited about what this company can do going forward.","Thank you. And let me now hand off to Sabrina.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Art, we're committed to focusing the business to gain market share in key strategic markets, where we believe we are structurally advantaged and\/or where there is significant runway for growth. The decisions we disclose today will allow us to better align our talent and financial resources against our most important priorities.","First, we've made the decision to wind down our Old Navy business in Japan by the end of fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are planning to close a number of dilutive Banana Republic stores, primarily internationally. Further, we are taking steps to streamline our operating model. Let me give you some detail.","Regarding, Old Navy. As a reminder, we launched Old Navy Japan in 2012 and have 53 stores. While Japan will continue to be an important market for the company with over 200 Gap and Banana Republic specialty and outlet stores remaining, the investment in terms of both financial and human capital to build a new brand in that market is significant.","Given the lack of growth in the apparel market there, we have decided this level of investment wasn't prudent. In the near term, Old Navy's growth ambitions will be anchored in North America, including our newest market, Mexico, as well as China and the franchise business. These opportunities present significant potential for us.","With regard to streamlining our operating model, we have an opportunity to become more nimble and better leverage our scale. This will allow us to deliver the continued expense discipline you have come to expect from us and mitigate the natural upward momentum in SG&A.","Together, we expect these decisions to result in annualized savings of about $275 million and operating margin improvement of nearly 2 percentage points. It's important to note that we expect an annualized sales loss of about $250 million from the closure of approximately 75 stores. We estimate restructuring costs of about $300 million, of which about $100 million is estimated to be non-cash.","Now, let me go back and speak to the results for the first quarter. While we're disappointed with our first quarter performance, it's important to note we've maintained our operating discipline in the areas we can control, as evidenced by continued expense management, ending inventory in line with our guidance and delivering positive free cash flow.","With regard to sales. Sales totaled $3.4 billion. Comp sales were down 5%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by about $20 million. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release.","Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross profit totaled $1.2 billion and gross margin contracted 260 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were down 170 basis points, driven by Old Navy and Banana Republic. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 90 basis points.","Regarding SG&A. First quarter total operating expenses were $987 million, slightly below last year. Marketing expenses were down about $9 million versus last year to $127 million. Operating income for the first quarter was $222 million and net earnings were $127 million. Earnings per share were $0.32.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the first quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the second quarter to be down in the low-single digits year-over-year. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of about $30 million and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash.","Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $139 million. Square footage was down 1.3% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release.","With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, we are operating in an evolving apparel retail environment and it's unclear whether the trends in Q1 will play forward for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are not reaffirming our 2016 guidance.","For now, we believe the current first call consensus EPS estimate of $1.92 falls within a reasonable range of potential outcomes, excluding the restructuring charges I outlined earlier. To be clear, the Q1 trend would need to improve in order to achieve this consensus estimate. If the Q1 trend continues, this would present downward pressure on the estimate.","Regarding other guidance metrics. Our cash flow generation and strong balance sheet has been and continue to be strengths of our business model. We intend to maintain that focus, and therefore we are reducing our 2016 capital spend guidance by about 20% or $125 million to about $525 million. We now expect depreciation and amortization of about $550 million.","Regarding square footage. We now expect to end the year down 2%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of about flat. It's important to note, we continue to have a diversified portfolio with the majority of our fleet either in the value segment or in growth markets, and only about a quarter of the fleet in traditional North America Gap and Banana Republic specialty stores.","Regarding tax. Due to the fact that the restructuring charges necessitate certain non-cash valuation allowances that impact our effective tax rate, we now believe the rate for the full year on continuing operations will be about 40%.","In closing, our global growth strategy remains intact. We are simply focusing our talents in capital on areas that have the greatest potential for profitability. After our actions, we will still have a presence in over 90 countries. While we're disappointed with the results for the quarter, we're energized about our plans to evolve our business and to capitalize on the competitive advantages we have.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it back over to Jack.","Jack Calandra","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities.","Simeon Siegel","Can you share any more color on the specifics behind streamlining the operating model? And then, Sabrina, maybe any help on the timing of when you'd expect the cost savings to hit?","Sabrina Simmons","I mean, most of the savings are going to come from the operating model actually. But I would tell you that the actions are going to take place throughout 2016. So we don't expect a significant portion of the annualized number to come in '16. Although, it is going to be helpful, and as I said, it's going to enable us to deliver the continued expense discipline that you'd expect from us.","Simeon Siegel","And then, if I can just follow-up on that. In light of the comments on the full year guide, do you think anything is changed in the ability to forecast the business longer-term? And is there any changes in the predictability in general? And if so, is there anything you can do to maintain your ability to plan the business going forward?","Sabrina Simmons","Look, I think what was really interesting about Q1 was really based, in our assumption, around traffic, which we had never expected positive traffic, but we didn't expect deeply negative traffic. And the other interesting thing about the trend was it was quite erratic. So we know that February started quite well, and even March started quite well and it fell off precipitously in the week before Easter.","So I think we just want to talk for a minute and see if the Q1 volatility is a continuing trend or an aberration for us. And that will allow us to get a better sense of the full year and the assumptions we want to base that on. But as I said, I think that the consensus estimate is very reasonable in terms of the range of outcomes that we could predict at this time.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Could you just talk to your promotional strategy today? I guess any changes to potentially drive increased traffic in the second half and any consideration to potentially taking a cut to initial ticket prices just to maybe reset the bar? And then, last question, just regarding distribution. I know you made some comments about Amazon. Just any opportunity in sort of the thought process between the potential partnership at some point?","Arthur Peck","Sure. Let me try to address all of those. Several of those bundled together, that was very clever. If we just think about promotion, I think it depends on the brand, because we're in very different positions on each brand. Gap and Banana having come out of situations where they were extremely deep over the course of the last, in some cases, 18 to 24 months, because of big product issues. And in both of those businesses we are working to drive topline, but also to tighten up our discounts.","And if you are a subscriber to our emails or in our stores or on our website, you'll notice that it is real, it is not easy, but we are working in terms of the depth of promotions, the promotional frequency and the breadth they cover. And I actually was just with the Gap team, where we went through looking at our commercial plan up to Memorial Day, and how we're trying to drive very compelling seasonally appropriate message from a promotional standpoint, so that we can play, but also working to protect margin as much as we can.","Same is really true on Banana, where we have backed off. And I will be the first to say that when you start tightening up in promotion, you are playing a game of chicken with your customers, and they try to way you out. And so we've been playing that now for really the last quarter. And we've seen more effects on this quite honestly. It will be easier in Gap, where we're seeing the numbers move more consistently in the right direction, a little more sporadic inside of Banana.","Maybe we have been promotional. We are promotional. We missed execution in Q1 from a marketing standpoint, and we are really tightening up the commercial messaging for Q2 and Q3, but we are going to continue to be promotional there. It's the way you have to play in the value space. And I think as we've said over the last few years, we have actually been quite good and pleased with the fact that we have improved our yields in managing the underlying promotions, while at the same time communicated a strong value message.","And then you have something like in Athleta, which inevitably is a smaller, but everyday a larger piece of the portfolio. It is still largely a [ph] right priced business, and a business that we really feel good about from a standpoint of the promotional cadence there.","On tickets, absolutely. It's something we've been looking at. And in fact, in some cases, both in Banana and Gap and Old Navy as well, all three, we have made some adjustments to our tickets, where we felt like the initial tickets, given where our competitive out the door pricing was just were not real at the end of the day. And that's something that we're always looking at.","On Amazon, I'll reiterate exactly what I said, regardless of how it got interpreted, and that is that, we are committed to making sure that we are where our customers are. And today, our customers have obviously moved in digital, very significantly to a mobile experience. And we are running as quickly as we can to make sure that we run alongside them everyday.","Amazon's presence in ecommerce is undeniable in this country, and therefore, to not fully consider all the options of distribution for us would be to not be thinking about things that were important to us, so no way was I previewing a partnership, I'm just previewing the fact that we want to make sure that we're very situationally aware of what is going on around this with our customers and in the world.","Operator","Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner","I wondered if we could go back to product for a minute, and Art, if you could talk about just the evolution that you're trying to affect at Old Navy where you had too much fashion and you need to adjust the mix, how long you expect that to take? And then, at Banana, where you may have assumed that the better product would get a better customer response and it didn't, what you're doing there? And then lastly, how we should see the evolving mix at Gap, since you are seeing success, both topline and margin, how we should see that evolve over the course of this year?","Arthur Peck","Yes. Let's talk Old Navy. Old Navy really started to soften for us in Q4. And that was right around the time, as you recall, we also had a leadership departure, and an interim leader. We got in there very quickly. We looked and diagnosed the problem by then Q1 was bought, so we had the assortment architecture that we had.","And again, the issue there is not as much less about product acceptance and much more about the architecture, the assortment, and frankly, duplicative and over assortment largely in the women's business, items that were bought for very short fashion buys, a collections orientation, and we lacked the depth and tightness around key items buys in Old Navy.","And so on diagnosing that, that's obviously come through Q1. As we have said before, focused on making changes as quickly as possible in Q2, which was coming at us pretty quickly, and I feel much better where we are in Q3 in the reset of the assortment architecture. I don't want to leave unmentioned the fact that we have not had strong marketing in the first quarter of the year. And that has contributed to what has been an unacceptably soft Old Navy business, when I believed value continues to remain strong.","And so it's deeply disappointing to me. We pulled TV out of April. We had ineffective TV. TV is a big brand driver for Old Navy and we're back on that as we look into Q2, and then certainly into Q3, and line up for back-to-school. And so I'm not going to call everything right, as we crossover the threshold into Q3, but I'm confident that we have the proper diagnosis, we took the proper actions, we've realigned the commercial plan, and the overall macro trends for a value competitor, family value competitor for Old Navy, should be strong.","And if I pivot to Banana for just a second. Again, where I see us having put the most intention on key item buys to the filters of the brand, I am pleased with what I'm saying. It is just too little, not fast enough, and then that the customer is responding to those, it validates the work that the team has been doing. And then I go to the words that I've been using of accelerating the change to get there as quickly as possible, and that's a period-over-period change, that we have confidence is going to continue to improve the business.","Banana is the toughest product business that we have just given the segment that they're in, and the work there has been the hardest work to reestablish the aesthetic and invite to consumer backend. Leading-edge metrics in Banana around customer feedback, around reviews, and things like that, are very positive, but we're not anywhere close to where we need to be as fast as we need to be there.","If I go to Gap, here's what I would say about Gap. If the traffic volatility that we, and the industry, had not experienced, that that have not happened in Q1, we would be sitting here having a very different and much more upbeat conversation. The metrics underneath the covers are moving in the right way. When we're in a mode like this, we track period-over-period leading-edge metrics and they're all moving in the right direction for Gap, but we had traffic volatility that made it very difficult to show the topline that we were looking for.","So it's a mix story across the businesses. And again, I just want to come back to Athleta, we've got strong strength of the portfolio. I mentioned that in my comments and I want to underline that as well. We have a big business in active for this company and it's a place where we are pushing hard to continue to store towards that space. As we look at that business, highest growing, and it will be a very significant segment of the overall ready-to-wear apparel space as we go forward and we plan on being here to stay.","Operator","And our next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Just wanted to inquire about maybe inventory goals. I know it's a volatile marketplace. It's tough to know the pace of trend that you'll be dealing with. But just how should we think about what would be a comfortable level of inventory for you guys by the end of maybe 2Q or yearend?","Sabrina Simmons","As I said, we're guiding to a low-single digit negative for Q2 and we just finished Q1 at a minus 3, so similar trend. We have said all along especially for our North America specialty brands, we want to keep the inventory pretty tight. Now the tightrope we all walk is you don't want to bring it down so far that you cut off your opportunity to get a positive comp, so that is always the delicate balance that we walk, but we think pitching it where we're pitching it right now at a low-single digit negative strikes that balance, so that's what we're looking for.","Operator","Let's go to Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Jennifer Davis","It Jennifer on for Paul. Quick question on Athleta. I was wondering if you could talk a little more about that, give us a sense of the size of the business now and maybe the margin structure of that business.","Sabrina Simmons","We don't disclose a lot about that yet, Jennifer, but you can get a sense from it in our other column. So included in the other column is Piperlime, INTERMIX and Athleta. And Piperlime, we wound down in Q1 of last year, so the number looks a little bit funny because of the lack of Piperlime sales this year when we had them last year. If you remove that, we'd have a double-digit increase in other and that gives you a sense directionally since Athleta is much larger than INTERMIX. That gives you a sense directionally of that business.","Jennifer Davis","Well, can you give us a sense of size of INTERMIX and how that's performing really?","Sabrina Simmons","Well, I think the way to think about that Jennifer is we haven't grown the fleet very much, since we purchased it. And so I think back then we probably gave a sense of the size of the purchase, so its kind of been trying to tighten up and learn about the business model, so there hasn't been much growth there, so I would say the primary driver of the growth in that column is going to be Athleta.","Jennifer Davis","And then did you say how much FX impacted earnings this quarter?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes, we did in the press release, but I'll tell you now again that its 4 percentage point drag on earnings per share in the quarter. Thanks for asking because I didn't say it in my remarks.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Sabrina, could you maybe give us a sense of the timing, I'm sorry if I missed it, but the timing of those roughly 75 store closures, maybe what quarter those will fall into? And then just to clarify, so those stores represent about $250 million in sales and generate a loss of $275 million or is there something else like back office or headcount that gets you to $275 million in savings?","Sabrina Simmons","So let me take the last part of that first. So the $275 million, I guess, is made up mostly of operating model changes we are making across the Board at Gap Inc., so the Old Navy Japan contribute to the $275 million, that is not the majority at all. So the majority is the streamlining of our operations across the board. With regard to the store closure timing, I would expect that to take place throughout 2016 and really probably weighted towards the end of the year.","Operator","Next we have Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","I guess, Sabrina, I was curious, I think you mentioned either 2 points or 200 basis points of an operating margin benefit go forward. I wonder if you're referring to 2017, if you're referring to the core business or does that have to do with some of the streamlining you're doing, that you're announcing today. So just curious about what you thought? Does that mean your longer term operating margins can get back into the low-double digits over the next couple of years?","And then second question, on Old Navy, sorry to beat it to death again, but just wondering between macro and weather, I mean how much could this fashion miss or over-fashion really have impacted the quarter here. It seems like it a couple of months now the trend has been decelerating, so just wondering as you parse out different buckets what you've learned and what's the timeframe again you'll see those product changes?","Sabrina Simmons","So I'll start on operating margin, so the base that we're talking off of is sort of our expected 2016 base, so if you remove the sale of $250 million and you remove all the associated line items that gets you the annualized savings of about $275 million, Brian, you get about nearly 2 percentage points of operating margin accretion. So it's actually quite powerful from an operating margin perspective. So we're very pleased with that.","This is going to be a journey back. So this is a big step forward in focusing us on the businesses that have the highest potential for long-term profitability and removing those that have quite a dilutive impact. So that's on the operating margin. I'll turn it over to Art for the second question.","Arthur Peck","Sorry, the second question was around Old Navy, correct, and product. Again, like I said earlier, we saw what we saw in Q4 and gone immediately. And again, that was coincident with the change in management and leadership transition. We made modest changes to Q1, as we previously indicated, because most of that product was either here or on the way. So could have a limited amount of impact.","And then incremental changes in Q2, as well, and the ability to significantly affect Q3, and obviously wholly affect Q4 And so from the standpoint of the assortment architecture, which again was really largely around women's product being over assorted and lacking in the appropriate variety across some of the key programs and then lacking the inventory depth behind key buys that is significantly corrected as we get into Q3.","At the same time we've had weaker marketing against some strong marketing that we've had in the previous year and we work to correct that. We put TV and the number of other things back into the schedule in order to bring our boys back everyday. And so do I believe that we're going to continue to see weakness in the business on a going forward consistently? I don't, because the value proposition again is in the sweet spot, where we should playing right now. I have much more confidence that the architecture of the assortment is back in line in Q3. And then Q4, I think we're in a very good shape and we have a very strong marketing program decked against it.","Operator","And next from the Telsey Advisory Group we're here from Dana Telsey.","Dana Telsey","As you think about the opportunities and the focus on supply chain, logistics, CRM, with each business what's the opportunity and what's the timeframe to achieve that? Do you think it help sales or helps margins?","Arthur Peck","Dana, that's a question we can probably spend a day talking about, so I thank you for asking it. Surely, you're aware obviously since we have spend a lot of time talking about the backend that we're doing, the backend work we're doing on supply chain, and that's work, that is again, a journey not a destination. I'd see significant scaling of that as we go forward in the businesses period-over-period. But it's again, a journey that we're on at the end of day.","If I look at some of the other areas, let's go to CRM first for a second. It's what I am really passionate about, I just announced a position in the company of a Chief Customer Officer, where we are taking a wide variety of desperate connections that we have with our customer and stitching them together organizationally and beginning to really build the capability to have a much more consistent, deep and holistic view of our customers as individuals.","In core of that, as you might imagine, is our credit card, which are our best customers. It's a program that we only have in the United States, which is part of why I go to structural strength. It's a very strong program here for us in the United States and it represents a significant portion of our business.","And I'm not of a mind that an organizational change brings about meaningful change, but we have had bits and pieces of the customer, again, in the number of places in the company and I've just broken those walls down and brought it together. And if I think about where best practices are broadly, we are well behind that.","I think we're actually in a pretty good space from where best practices are in the apparel industry and I'm looking to accelerate that significantly there also. And again, credit card is the core, web browsing history, obviously all your tender history, loyalty program, multi-tender loyalty program all coming together in one place. And that's one example.","And again, I'm not going to tell you that's a lights on moment in Q3 or Q4 or something like that, we live in a world today where we spend a great deal of money on marketing, something else that I've signaled to you before, and a lot of that money is spent in very traditional ways. And we are now increasingly enabling the capability to be much more one-on-one in our communication targeted and personalizing our communication. And that's a pivotal way from some of the traditional vehicles that we've seen to much deeper form of communication through CRM.","I had my Board this week, and I explained to them that one of the places this will manifest itself is I think windows today are much less relevant than they have historically been and you'll see this going forward that we're actually skinning down our windows treatment in Gap, as an example, on the belief that if you haven't won at the digital interface on the front end, your windows in the mall store probably not going to make a difference at the end of the day. So this is work that's underway. Again, and I am happy, of course, as always to talk you separately, but its work that we're enthusiastic about, what we believe we really truly have some structural advantages.","Operator","And we have time for one final question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","I would love to hear a bit of thoughts on ecommerce side of the business. It's such a strong suite for you guys for so many years. I know it sounds like you're kind of moving a little bit more towards investing behind the mobile capabilities to round out the suite of your prowess there. But could you give us an update on kind of how you're thinking about ecommerce business? And then maybe how we should expect the mobile side of it to pulled in over time?","Arthur Peck","I think it's really a question to place where we have had strength and we continue to have strength. And we see it obviously as everybody does, I think, a long-term progressive shift of the consumer moving in that direction. Let me go straight to mobile for a second, but let me do the, sort of, what I call the leaky bucket.","If you think about business moving from stores to a desktop or laptop to mobile, stores for the industry, conversion of traffic into stores, whether its in the mid-20s to the high-30s or something like that; if you go down to a desktop or a laptop experience, where someone is buying, that traffic converts somewhere in the low-single digits for most people out there.","And then if you go to a mobile experience a lot of people out there today are seeing conversion off of mobile traffic as a fractional single-digit. And so the work that we're doing is very much about addressing that migration of traffic and making sure that the opportunity for us to monetize that traffic as it moves remains there at the end of the day.","So if I go straight to mobile, a big part of mobile is making sure that people have an incredibly easy shopping experience and checkout experience on the mobile device, but the content is relevant, so that needs a responsive website, which we're largely towards achieving right now. And then, obviously, content and the digital experience that shows up on a screen that's 2.5x5 inches at the end of the day, and so that's something where we're very focused for us.","Overall, our traffic has grown and it's grown with digital. If I were a retailer out there, who was looking at this and was seeing my traffic being directly substituted from my stores to a desktop to a laptop to a mobile device, I would really start to worry about that bucket leaking out the of the business. And so we're committed to making sure where our customer is. And our customer today increasingly is on a mobile device, which means a great mobile shopping brand and ecommerce experience.","End of Q&A","Jack Calandra","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O'Connell","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. For those of you participating in the webcast, please turn to Slides 2 and 3.","I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.

Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and welcome, everybody, to the company's fourth quarter earnings call. I want to talk a little bit about the fourth quarter and give you some color around it. I think it's important when you end a fiscal year for you to hear what I think were the accomplishments for Gap Inc. in 2012.","So in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with our sales. Five comp, 10% total sales. Yes, the 53rd week was in that. But at the end of the day, when you back that out, we had a market share gaining quarter and that's what's important to me, not only for us to have good execution, to gain customers, put the product in front of customers that is right for each one of our brands, but to go out and actually gain market share.","One of the areas that's worth highlighting is our online business was up 28%, and that was a very good performance by, as everybody knows, a critical part of the company's long-term growth strategy.","We had a $0.73 in earnings per share and that was a 66% increase over the year before. So on the surface, those are very good-looking numbers for Gap Inc. With that said, we believe there's a lot more business to be had for us in December. When I look at the business and dissect it, and spend time with the teams after the holidays, we still have quite a bit of opportunity available to us and value to unlock between Thanksgiving and Christmas.","Now the consumer patterns are really shifting and you have this big amount of business being done around Thanksgiving and Black Friday and a lot of business being done the last 3 days before Christmas. We got to figure out the 3 weeks in between. Now, we have an opportunity to do that, because we have multiple brands. Because we can play the online channel, the outlet channel, the specialty channel differently to make sure we capture as much business as possible and unlock as much earnings as we can possibly get in that 4-week period.","The last thing I should mention about Q4 is the acquisition of Intermix. That's something we were just very pleased with. We love that business. There's a lot of a lot of talented people at Intermix. We're going to help them when it comes to their integration strategy, what could be their long-term growth. Early days, but we feel even better about the decision we made today than we did 6 weeks ago.","Now, let me turn to 2012. And from my perspective, what were the key accomplishments for Gap Inc. in the last fiscal year? It starts, for me, and ends with product. I've been very pleased with our merchant teams, our design teams and how they brought product to life that's absolutely right on what the brand stands for, the customers they need to gain, the aesthetic and, consistently, doing that season after season. Part of that were the investments we made. Again, they were targeted. They were in key categories. Where can we make an investment that a customer is going to notice and is done in a category that is so quintessentially associated with that brand that we know we can build a business from? And we added our creative advisor role, which was new for us, to make sure that our teams were given every single chance and as much talent as they needed to be successful.","We married that up with an investment in marketing. And the marketing investment was mostly in Gap brand. It was mostly made domestically. And that was all about getting the brand back to relevance, getting people to see the incredible equity in this iconic, American casual business. And the Be Bright campaign was launched 12 months ago. It's been a very good platform for the business. One of the key focuses and where some of the investment went for Gap brand was to get new customers in their stores and on online. And the way they use social media, some of the unique relationships and partnerships that Gap had, I think, was a big contributor to their performance in 2012.","China continues to do very well for us. We opened up 30 stores in China in 2012. We've brought the outlet business into China. So now in China, we have our specialty business; our online business, that opened up day 1 when our stores opened; and the outlet business. What I've been really impressed was the team we built, from basically nothing 2.5 years ago. We have an office in Shanghai of talented people, a mixture of people who know Gap, who decided to relocate to Shanghai and some incredible people that we've hired locally. That team is building a business for the future. China is a cornerstone of future growth for Gap Inc.","Our awareness in China continues to grow, part of that is the stores, a big part is the marketing we're putting behind that business. If you don't build a brand in China, you are not going to make it. Too many new entrants, too much competition and if you put the right marketing and stand for something and differentiate yourself, you're going to have a long term successful, profitable business.","We put some new growth irons in the fire in 2012. We opened up our first Piperlime store in SoHo, to try to find the right marriage between that online business, which is digital, and the physical expression of Piperlime. We launched e-commerce in Japan across Gap brand and Banana Republic and one of the biggest accomplishments of the year for us was taking Old Navy outside of its domestic domain, where it's been in for almost 20 years and taking it on to the International stage by opening our first store up in Tokyo. And the team did an incredible job. The customer response has been great because what's missing for so many customers in Tokyo was this family brand based on American aesthetic with a value proposition. And I think that combination has resonated very well. And I'll talk about 2013 later on.","Let me give you the update on our existing growth initiatives. And you all know them, our franchise business went into 9 new countries, opened up 85 stores. Our outlet business, that is now a global business, had the most store openings they've had in the last 5 years. Our Athleta division added 25 brand new stores and our online business just continued to grow globally. So when you think about it, we're doing the right thing for customers. We're bringing new customers into the Gap Inc. portfolio and family of brands with Athleta. We're using our channels to provide access to our customers online, outlet and specialty. On the other side of the coin, moving these businesses so they become a bigger and bigger part of our total revenue is great for return on capital. So this is, strategically, the right balance between what's right for the customer and what's right for our economic model.","And lastly, in October, we completely restructured our business. We felt very strongly, the customer is changing, the customer is looking for a seamless experience. They see everything we do as one single brand. So in order to make sure that our structure and our strategies match up to where customers are and where customers -- more importantly, where they're going, we went to a new structure of global brands. Three global brand presidents across every geography and every channel leading our iconic brands: Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic. That was such an important change. That was a critical part, so it introduced speed into the company. Looking at a single customer through 1 lens, and what is the right way to get more share of wallet from that customer when you have all these different choices? And one single team can do that for us.","And here we find ourselves in the first month of the first quarter of a brand new fiscal year. And we've been spending a lot of time talking to our teams about where is the customer today? Where is the economy? That's important for us. Because now with a new global platform, we have choices. Where do we think that the biggest potential is for us? And the consumer, at the end of the day, we are looking at the consumer and saying, we have to continue to give her reasons to buy, more excitement. Just think of some examples last year. When we launched the Rockstar jeans at Old Navy. That was provocative. That gave her, her reason to buy. When Gap came on the fall with our marketing campaign called Icons Redefined, that gave her, her reason to buy. If you're going to win in this environment doing the same thing all over again is not a winning strategy. We have to bring more and more uniqueness, differentiation and excitement to the business.","So beyond that, some big priorities for us as we look forward, one is the growth. As we look at our company. We're looking at Old Navy Japan, let's put 15 or 20 stores in there in 2013. Build on that 1 successful store and then I'm asking the team led by Stefan Larsson, where to from here? Not this year, going forward? We're going to answer that question this year. China. We're going to open up 35 stores in China in 2013. At the same time, we're going to ask ourself the question: what's the next brand going into China? When? How are we going to put those in the China marketplace? How's the team going to operate that? We're going to have those answers done this year.","The franchise business is going to add around 75 stores, building on a very good year last year. More global outlet growth, more online growth. And Athleta is going to add around 30 stores. It's a step up from previous years. If you look at the company in the last 5 years, this is the most new square footage we put in since 2007. As a matter of fact, we're going to grow square footage for the first time since 2007. And the driver of that is what I just took you through, but also this is the last year of our 5-year real estate plan.","Five-year real estate plan was put forward in 2008 to do what? To cut back on domestic square footage through closures, consolidations and getting rid of square footage where we just did not need. This is the last year. So here we come now in 2013 with the most openings, much more thoughtful, we're going to have less closures in 2014 as we complete the 5-year strategy this year. So I'm pretty excited, as you could tell, about what the future holds for us when it comes to new square footage, and the other area of focus for me is Omni-channel.","You're going to hear a lot about that from a lot of other companies, here's all I care about: Can we get a competitive advantage? There's probably 5 or 6 components to it, and just everybody's going to get that over the next 3 years. What are we going to do different? And I really am just highly motivated by Art Peck, who took over our growth, innovation and digital team with the restructure we made in the fall and the ideas they're coming forward with, the talent they've brought in and how we're going to approach the marketplace, so the customer participates in the brands seamlessly. That's so important. Seamless experience. We have some really good ideas that are going to be launched in 2013, which we'll talk about down the road. We have to have this to win long term.","Now those 2 key initiatives, the work on Omni-channel and the step-up in our growth, and that sits on top of a foundation of steady growth with consistency in our product delivery, marketing, store execution. All those components that allow the foundation of the business to positively comp in 2013 as it did in 2012.","So with that said, we know that our customers have expectations of us and our shareholders have expectations of Gap Inc. in 2013. Nobody puts more pressure on themselves than we do as a company. We really were proud of what we did in 2012. We know we could do more. We know we have to do more. We know we have to make sure a lot of things that I talked to you about today get executed flawlessly. We know where it starts, with product, and we know we have to be very good at some of the other initiatives and innovation we need to have in the business in order for us to win. So with that said, I look forward to giving your updates throughout the year on our performance and how we're moving forward in the strategic plan.","Let me now hand it over to Sabrina to give you an update on our financial performance for '12 and to provide you guidance for 2013. Sabrina?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year results and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2013. Please turn to Slide 4.","We are very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full-year performance. We achieved our stated 2012 objectives, namely, increasing sales with healthy merchandise margins; prudently investing in our business; and growing earnings per share.","Here are some highlights for the full year: Net sales grew 8% to $15.7 billion, with comps up 5%. We invested in product, marketing and payroll, which drove successful results in North America. In addition we made investments to support our strategy of expanding through new channels and geographies. Even with these investments, we expanded our operating margin 250 basis points to 12.4%. We delivered earnings of over $1.1 billion and grew earnings per share nearly 50% to $2.33.","And finally, we distributed $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Please turn to Slide 5 for our earnings recap. In the fourth quarter, operating income was $602 million, up $230 million, and net income was $351 million, up $133 million. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 66% to $0.73 per share.","Turning to Slide 6. Sales performance. Driven by solid product acceptance, fourth quarter total sales were $4.7 billion, up 10% including the 53rd week, with comp sales up 5%. Full-year total sales were up 8% to $15.7 billion and comparable sales were up 5% for the year. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Turning to Slide 7, gross profit. For the fourth quarter, gross profit dollars grew by 26% to $1.8 billion, and gross margin was up 480 basis points to 37.6%. Our merchandise margins were up 370 basis points, driven by decreases in average unit cost. And rent and occupancy leveraged 110 basis points. For the full year, gross profit dollars grew by 17% to $6.2 billion, and gross margin was up 320 basis points to 39.4%. Our merchandise margins were up 200 basis points driven by improved product acceptance, especially in the Women's businesses across all of our brands. Rent and occupancy leveraged 120 basis points.","Turning to inventory on Slide 8. Inventory dollars per store were up 5% at the end of the fourth quarter in line with our comp performance.","Please turn to Slide 9 for operating expenses. We noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our business during 2012 and highlighted that we would deleverage. In line with that framework, for the fourth quarter, total operating expenses are $1.2 billion, up $141 million from the prior-year driven by store-related expenses and marketing. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses deleveraged by 70 basis points.","For the full-year, total operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up $393 million from the prior year, and deleveraged, as a percent to sales, by 60 basis points. Marketing expenses were $653 million, up $105 million to last year. As a reminder, our incremental marketing investments for the year were focused on Gap brand and CRM.","Please turn to Slide 10 for capital expenditures and store count. For the full year, capital expenditures were $659 million. With regard to company-operated stores, for the full year, we opened 28 stores on a net basis and ended the year with 3,095 stores. Square footage was down 1% compared to Q4 2011, driven by downsizes in our Old Navy business and consolidation of our Gap store base in North America. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.","Regarding cash and share count on Slide 11. For the full-year, free cash flow was an inflow of $1.3 billion, and we ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Two noteworthy points regarding our use of cash during the year: First, you'll recall we repaid the remaining balance on our term loan in Q3 for $360 million. Second, we acquired Intermix for about $130 million in Q4. For the full year, we distributed $1.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends, including $563 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with 463 million shares outstanding.","And now I'd like to share our outlook for the coming year. Please turn to Slide 12. In 2013, we will use a balanced approach to deliver on our financial goals. Specifically, we'll focus on: growing sales with healthy merchandise margins, managing our expenses in a disciplined manner and delivering operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth. And as always, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders.","With regards to growing sales with healthy merchandise margins, our objective is to deliver modest positive comps on a full-year basis in our large existing base. In addition to our comp base, we plan to drive increased revenue through our new brands, channels and geographies, for example, Athleta, Gap China, Old Navy Japan, franchise and global outlets. We remain committed to disciplined inventory management and expect inventory dollars per store at the end of Q1 to increase in the mid-single-digits on last year's 7% decrease.","Our second priority is managing our expenses prudently. Assuming we achieve our goal of revenue growth, we would naturally expect total expense dollars to increase. As a rate of sales, however, we expect operating expenses on a full-year basis to leverage. Given our balanced approach to delivering shareholder value, expense leverage will be a component of achieving operating margin expansion. And that leads to our third priority of operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth.","We expect to grow operating margin from about 12% in 2012 to about 13% in 2013. We expect earnings per share for fiscal '13 to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. Our guidance contemplates some of the impact of foreign currency headwinds, specifically the weakening yen.","As a reminder, we operate wholly owned stores in 8 countries and are therefore subject to the economic and translation impact of foreign currency movements. To be helpful, the average rate in 2012 for the yen was about 80. Current spot rate for the yen has weakened by about 15%, which means our yen-based sales and earnings translate to fewer U.S. dollars. When we issue our 10-K in a few weeks, we expect to report sales in Asia of about $1.3 billion. The vast majority being yen-based sales. Although contemplating currency fluctuation is not new to how we set our guidance, we're calling out the impact this year due to the rapidity and magnitude of the recent move of the yen versus the dollar, while other currencies have remained much more stable.","Regarding returning excess cash to shareholders. As evidence of our commitment to this principle, over the past 3 years, we have repurchased about 240 million shares for about $5 billion, or at an average price of about $21 per share. In addition to share repurchases, we're increasing our dividend for the fourth consecutive year. In 2013, we intend to increase our dividend 20% to $0.60 per share. As a reminder, we also announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization in January.","Please turn to Slide 13 for some additional full-year metrics. Regarding company-operated stores, net of repositions, we plan to open about 160 and close about 80. Store openings are weighted towards Gap China, Old Navy Japan, Athleta and global outlets, while store closures are weighted towards Gap North America.","As we continue to optimize our North America fleet and build on our strategy of expanding through new channels and geographies, we expect square footage to increase by about 1%. This is the first time since 2007 that we're growing our square footage. We expect capital expenditures to be about $675 million, and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. And finally, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be about 39%.","In conclusion, we're pleased with how we executed against all of our 2012 objectives. As we enter 2013, we're focused on a balanced approach to achieving our financial goals and driving further value for our shareholders.","Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","Thanks, Sabrina. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Betty Chen with Wedbush Securities.","Betty Y. Chen - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Glenn, if you can talk a little bit about brand building. Certainly, it sounds like the team made a lot of effort and progress in 2012. If you can kind of run us through where each brand stands in your mind in terms of how much additional opportunity is left both domestically, and especially, you talked about how important it is to build that in China. Where do you think they've sort of made progress in that front and how does that relate into sort of what we should expect for marketing expenses in 2013?","Glenn K. Murphy","Betty, I'll answer the first part of it. Then I'll hand it over to Sabrina on the second part. There's 2 parts from our perspective when it comes to the reasons why we spend marketing at all. So there's always a fixed part of marketing inside of our budget, in our store signage, windows, then there's a variable component, which are choices we make that we expect a return from. I'd say there's no need for any marketing domestically on awareness, whereas in China, most of our marketing and the tactics and the tools we're using are all about driving awareness. So in the U.S., and let me just focus around Gap, I think we started to gain some confidence about 18 months ago on New York City and the creative center, what the team was putting together, how we thought product was going to come to life in spring 2011. We brought a brand-new CMO in, who's going to be in charge of the globe. He developed a very good platform and that's the reason we decided to put some money, almost exclusively, in our domestic Gap business. While awareness has really not moved in, I don't know how far back, but certainly since I've been here, the issue was about relevance and building equity and being much more current to the customers that we were targeting on our domestic business. So from my Scorecard, there's no such thing as the perfect outcome when it came to the marketing being invested, but we felt good with what the Gap team did. We felt it was, again, the platform was authentic. It was appropriate for the brand. I think that as I said in my opening comments, the choice of media was also, I think, smartly done, finding the right mix. Not everybody should run towards social media. Some of those tools don't really have a great return right now, but there was a great balance in how the team approached it. And in China, which I spent a lot of time in, I'd say the awareness, I've been very impressed. We have, in China, a balance between the global marketing that comes out of New York and gets used by the team in China and we have a unique agency we use in China to speak and to augment the message and to build the brand, especially when you're opening stores, as we did last year in 5 new markets. So you can never assume that -- because we know where our awareness is coming in and that we choose different marketing content to go into these new markets we're going into and make sure people know, A, we're American. What does Gap stand for? And why you should embrace the brand? These are stories, and marketing messaging has nothing to do with the value proposition, and has everything to do with the brand. As I said at the opening, that's what long-term success, as far as we're concerned, in China is going to look like, it's all about brand-building. So we've actually, again, felt good in 2012. Was it perfect? No. Are we encouraged by the progress on the scores we look at? Yes. And we're going to continue to spend some marketing in 2013 but, obviously, nowhere near the step up we talked about in 2012.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, and just to add to that, we don't specifically guide to marketing spend and we do that purposefully because we like to keep flexibility throughout the year as to monitoring the marketing effectiveness and actually making decisions about how much we want to invest given business environment. So not a lot to say on the full year. To be helpful on the first quarter, what I'll tell you is we have no plans to cut marketing expense versus last year for the first quarter.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Glenn, I was wondering, if you could just talk about how you managed through the -- balancing the need to improve product execution and come up with some of those big ideas that you were talking about on the merchandising side? How do you sort of balance that while managing the risk in the business? And what sort of management tools do the merchants and the designers have at their disposal to manage that as well?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I think you know that our business is not based on perfection. It's based on precision. It's based on history. It's based on talent. Trust me, we have more than enough tools, which I'm not going to take you through, Kimberly, but we have more than enough tools that the team can measure in hindsight, in market to get a sense, the decisions that we were making. The most important thing for me that the team has developed over the last couple of years, which we never had before, was to get a very early read at the beginning of a season from product that goes online, which tends to go on first before our product gets in the store. And we used to look at that result and use it more to cheer the accomplishments we had in that given season. And the last couple of years, we use it to read very quickly what is -- what are we learning from that online and how do we affect the upcoming season or how do we affect product in that season that's going to last longer than 12 weeks? So -- and this is not again -- this is not a revolutionary move for us, but our ability [indiscernible] -- for us to chase into good ideas and to make sure the merchants, because the design team has done their job now, the merchants and the inventory management team and the sourcing team and the supply chain team are working in tandem. We've redesigned that whole process, whereby the minute the read comes out and we see an opportunity, we can move on that very quickly, which really accomplishes one of the goals that Sabrina and I have been working on since we started together, which was to reduce some of the volatility in the business. So I'd say that is the most important thing that I've seen. Now, to I'd say bigger ideas, I think that is a risk-reducing strategy because we've been tightening up our assortment, slowly and thoughtfully, across all our brands for the last couple of years. We're never going to become just a straight item business. Collections matter, wardrobing matters. But looking at the total assortment, I think the team has recognized that in some cases, in categories that matter to us, less is more. And I think that does reduce the risk. I mean, I've always internally said to our inventory management team even though I could be their biggest critic, when I defend them, it's like it's very difficult to do a job if somebody's buying 24 of something when the customer only really wants 12 or 15. And you can have a huge, big idea on 12 or 15 colors of a skimmer bottom that launches in the spring and that could still be very big event, a big idea, can drive traffic and be brand right and create some excitement around the business, and the incremental 8 or 10 colors really don't drive any gross margin dollars for the business. So in some ways, the focus that each one of our brands is taking to different levels across different categories, I think, provides a little bit of de-risking of the assortment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","I had a question. I'm excited about your announced expansion plans and about the fact that your store closing program is going to conclude this year, at least that's my understanding. And I'm wondering then if we should look for -- I think we should look for the differentiating point between sales and total sales and comps to begin to widen. And I'm wondering if in fiscal '14, if we could look for that differential to become even broader as the store closing program becomes much smaller. Just so that we could model out our sales. And if you could touch on your opportunity for AUC opportunity this year, that would be helpful as well.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I would say, Janet, that, that's certainly directionally correct. We -- we've been working on the total growth of the business and it starts with a very strong base. And that's what's most important to us, that's where our volume is. So let's call that domestic business -- domestic stores within the domestic brands including some Europe, including Japan that make up our comp pool. So this year having done a 5 comp, which the business felt good about, I think that was not only gain market share from a comp perspective, but I think that's sort of the health of the business now. We have 1 more, what I'd say, big year, which is 2013. There's always going to be in a fleet of 3,200 to 3,300 stores. I'm just throwing a number out. There's always going to be 30, 40, 50 stores that you've got to reposition or close because the consumer is going to dictate that. But at the end of the day, are massive change and it's really significant what we've done in the last 8 years -- sorry, the last 5 years, starting 2008, with 1 more year to ago. But what that's going to help is that our spread, which is what you're referring to, the delta between our comp store sales and our total store sales, there's been a drag on that spread with the fairly sizable number of closures we've had inside the business, mostly at Gap brand. But there's been some sprinkled across different parts of the world as well. But I think it is one of our goals, it's not the most important goal in the business, but we look at some of our global competitors in 2012 who also had a 5 comp and in some cases, they had as double-digit total sales. So do we think this year's number, which was 3, but in fairness, was helped by the 53rd week, do we think that number should widen over time as the real estate program comes to an end? Do we get to just normalize the amount of closing and consolidations and then the new store program picked up, now we have 6 brands to choose from, obviously, the first 3 mattered the most. I think that's absolutely a goal. And one question that I answered at the last call was what I'm most excited about that, with the new economic model that Sabrina and I put together, is that those incremental stores come at a much better contribution to our operating margin than the last time we went through this, where we were putting the third or fourth store in the United States, in a market that we since had to go and close that store where the market only dictated 2 stores. So now as you start adding Athleta, that's all pure raw new contribution and I think will be good to operating margin over time, same with Athleta, same with our franchise business and same with our outlet business. So those are all great -- that incremental dollar hits our P&L in a way that's much more accretive to the overall business over time, than it would've been the last time we tried to grow our fleet, which was call it, 2002 to 2007.","Sabrina L. Simmons","And the only thing I'd add to what Glenn said is that's all absolutely true sort of assuming currencies hold constant. So for example, in 2013, the point we were trying to make is obviously, that's spread between comp because comp is FX neutral. The spread between comp and total sales will be impacted by the foreign currency headwind in Japan. So that's just something to watch. And then with regards to the AUC opportunity, I would say for '13, Janet, I mean, Q1 is the last quarter where in 2012, we were still facing headwinds. So we have a little bit of benefit there in Q1. After that I would say it's sort of normalized, it becomes sort of a nonissue. And we're just sort of going to manage through [ph] and without the big swings up or the big swings down that we had in '11 and '12.","Operator","We'll go next to John Morris with BMO Capital Markets.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Glenn, can you talk a little bit about the progress that you're making at Old Navy under the new team? What can customers expect to see differently this year because I think we'll see more from the new Old team, what will they expect to see differently compared to the old, Old Navy? How will the point of view in terms of the product, et cetera, evolve?","Glenn K. Murphy","I think the first thing, John, that's worth noting is that Stefan has been here just under 6 months and when we brought him in, it's because he believed in the brand and, most importantly, the brand positioning, which was a nonnegotiable and the customers that Old Navy goes after. Mostly that it's a family brand. And we didn't want to have to revisit the notion that people can come in and put their own impression on the brand. The brand is what it is. Stefan has come in to improve it and evolve the brand. And I would say what customers are going to see is, even before Stefan was involved, the team that was there previously, I'm willing to say that they were making improvements in this first quarter, in terms of product assortment, that was better than the quarter before in 2012. Now it's our job to translate that into greater sales and greater earnings, but they were already making improvements. I'd say he's going to have 2 impacts that should be noticeable to our customer. I think he's been working vigorously with the team on the assortment. And a little less -- like what I said to Kimberly, a little less about tightening it up, although I'm sure that's going to be one of the outcomes. I'd say that he's very big on building dominant categories. I think he's helping with the fashion part of the business that is right for Old Navy, because this is not a fast fashion business. But making sure we get credit for the fashion that's in Old Navy. Because at the end of the day, what we provide is everyday fashion essentials to the family. And I think he is really driving that point home and he's bringing some discipline into the assortment planning. And that's something he's very skilled at. The other side is that we were very excited this week that Ivan Wicksteed joined us, who's our new CMO. And I don't think his impact will be felt immediately, but we brought him in given the incredible track record and experience he's had. And I think our customers will start to enjoy his handprint on the marketing messaging in the business in fall and holiday. And I've just been very happy with how he's come in to the team, working with our merchant team and working with the design team and all under Stefan. So Stefan didn't come in to turn the brand upside down. He came in to move the brand, at a pace that I'm comfortable with. Let there be no doubt, he's come in to improve the business. That is what he's asked to do.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Glenn, are you close to releasing some of the marketing dollars for Old Navy as well? I know you were thinking about that as recently as the previous quarter.","Glenn K. Murphy","They've got all the marketing dollars any brand would ever need.","Operator","We will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The SG&A has been very tightly managed for years. I know you spent a little bit in 2012. But -- as we look out over the longer term, are there any big investments that we should be thinking about, whether it's e-commerce, or Omni-channel or any of the other new programs or plans that you're expecting?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. I mean, we're focused just on our 2013 guidance right now, Lorraine, and we can talk probably more about the longer-term at Analyst Day. But I would say that we're being very measured about the pace of our investments. So you have observed that we've raised capital spend from probably an average of $475 million, $500 million per year up to -- we spent over $650 million in '12, we just guided to $675 million. So we are definitely focused on the long term and in propelling the long-term growth and then in making the right investments and putting the dollar behind that. But beyond what we've guided to, there's nothing radical that we intend to shift. Within those dollars we've guided to, we feel really comfortable that we've appropriated enough to those strategically important projects like Omni-channel, like Gap China, like Old Navy Japan.","Glenn K. Murphy","I think we're learning and teaching the business very well that in some cases, there's a lot of initiatives or variable expense we're using in different areas of the business that we either can't afford or is not necessary anymore. So brick in, brick out, in terms of state of mind is something that's very important in our business and now Sabrina mentioned China. For us to have a really long-term viable business in China, there's some money we do have to invest, whether it's in people or whether it's in marketing. And we're challenging the teams internally, especially the new, 3 global presidents to look at their portfolio because we're going to hold them to a certain level of return and expectations on return on sales and return on capital. So I think what I like about the new structure, it gives them a chance to look at where the most -- the best opportunities globally where they should be investing their time and their energy and their capital to get the highest return. But we will always have new initiatives. If we're not innovating and bringing new initiatives forward, the company's just going to go backwards. So we're pushing the team really hard on both fronts, but we're telling them very clearly as they work the one side of the growth story, they have to go back into their P&L aggressively and carve out money that's no longer needed, and it's -- or is not getting a return. That's how we're trying to -- that's how the 2 of us are trying to manage the business.","Operator","We'll go next to Adrienne Tennant with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Glenn, can you talk about the DTC opportunity? Obviously, looks like it's about 12% for 2012. Sort of philosophically, how do you think that, that's evolving across the sector? How aggressively do you want to grow that piece of the business as a percent of sales, and do you have any targets in mind for us?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, we don't -- we don't put out targets. We certainly have some numbers internally. What I would say is I would sort of take it up a notch and say, if we just look at the customer first, where we're moving and how it moved a little bit in 2012, we'll take a bigger step in 2013 as there's this is notion of easy buy anywhere. And at the end of the day, to be quite honest with you, I don't care where that unit goes. The unit is going to go where we can -- where the customer wants it and we can get the highest return on that one unit. If that's online, if that's specialty, if that's International. And I think that our online business is obviously growing, that's a channel of choice. We've been working very hard to make sure that our website is attractive, that it's fast and that our delivery time to the consumer, that we over exceed their expectations. So I look, at the end [ph], what's going to happen here is the customer will eventually dictate whether 12 goes to 15, whether 12 goes to 18. Where it settles out. We're not going to stop it, we're not going to put any constraints on it. But as we move and make a big move in 2013 to have really a seamless approach to this. Because what's going to happen at one point, my view is, is that we don't want to get anybody should be thinking about getting credit for the sale. And if you think of 2012 prior to the restructuring, we were setup that somebody owned the P&L online, somebody owned it in outlet, somebody owned it in specialty, domestic and somebody owned it Internationally, it was 4 different P&L owners. And they had agendas that ran through Sabrina and myself, and we were in charge of coordinating those agendas and making sure we're doing the right thing for the company and the right thing for customers. Now you have 3 Global Brand Presidents. And their job is to say that I have a customer who chooses to shop in 3 different channels across multiple countries. How do I maximize that as best as I can? When you take that kind of approach and think of something as simple as order online, reserve in the store, it doesn't matter whose P&L that goes under, it's going to go under the Gap Global P&L. And I think that the teams now are working much better together once we broke down the natural barriers. Because I was a big believer in the previous structure we had, of course, and now I'm a bigger believer in the go-forward structure that it just takes everything out of the way and we always try to do the right thing. If that means feeding more inventory into online, we're going to do that. If that means feed into another country, we're going to do that. But the key thing here is that it's just going to become more and more seamless. So we're going to let it go as high as it can, and as I said in my earlier comments, any unit that goes through purely in our online channel has a better return on sales and, of course, a better return on capital than anything in our stores. And now that we have a reset real estate, we were thoughtful in 2008. We didn't anticipate exactly where the online business or the outlet business was going to be, but we were thoughtful going [ph], we don't need this number of stores, we certainly don't need this size of store and with the reengineered fleet we have in place, now, I think, we can make sure we move that inventory and satisfy customers, because access and convenience is becoming that much more important and I think with our fleet and strong online site, I think we can meet the customer demand.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess maybe for Glenn, it seems like the Gap North America brand sales are 30% smaller than where you peaked a couple of years ago, and I guess the assumption is much of that has been a decline in women's market share. So we were curious how you ranked, maybe which categories, Gap north America on the women's side has the biggest opportunity to regain share and move the needle over the next year or 2?","Glenn K. Murphy","I'd say, Brian, without getting into the category strategies, where you are correct, is that our Kids and Baby share is larger in that universe than our Adult share. And as we told, I think investors, a couple of years ago, it sort of builds on the issue why did we reengineer our real estate. One of it was, because there was a time where we had 450 standalone Baby store -- Kids and Baby stores. And we really strategically thought that if there were customers that we did not -- we're not able to attract or satisfy, make them loyal to Gap brand, 5 years ago, as their lives evolve, how do we get them engaged again in the Adult business. And one way to do that is the cross shopping that exist inside of a 12,000 square-foot Gap store where you can pass through between Kids and Baby and Adult. I think that now that real estate is almost completely done, that's going to be a big opportunity for Stephen Sunnucks and his team and much easier to use strength of Kids and Baby, and the market share and the natural draw, to get some, in this case, women shopping in the Adult section. But there are key categories. Nothing is going to change in terms of the strategies, and I'm not here to give out where we ought -- equal to our total share in adult and where are we above and where are we below. At the end of the day, this is a business that is grounded first and foremost in depth [ph] in the adult business. And our team in LA has done a great job. I think we have -- we're seeing the results of that again this spring with some of the work they've done. And that's -- there's probably 3 or 4 Adult categories that are really important. That would be #1. And the team is very focused on how do we make sure we continue to gain share, continue to be innovative, continue to be current and relevant in the denim business and that's where I know the merchants and designers are putting most of their energy.","Operator","We'll go next to Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of some external factors, could you brief us on the environment for product cost inflation? And also, payroll taxes. Do you think that certain of your banners will be more impacted than others and what our kind of the competitive proactive stances you can take in light of that? And if I could just ask a modeling question, should we be more encouraged on the upside from the SG&A margin or the GM as we think about your op margin expansion guidance?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Sure. Let me try and hit those 3 topics really quickly. So on the average unit cost front, as I said, Q1 is pretty much the last quarter that we get tailwinds because we were still facing increases, although nothing like the back half of '11, we were still facing increases in AUC in the first quarter of '12. After the first quarter, it really moderates and there's really no significant story around average unit cost. So that will just be managed in its normal way and we'll manage through our mix and making select decisions around where we invest and not. With regards to the payroll tax, it's really hard to split out the impact of any of these moves. But I think it's fair to say that our consumers now, after so many years of a tough economy, are sort of getting probably thicker skinned about any of these moves in particular. I think there's certainly some that are impacted more directly than others. But overall, can we claim a large, direct impact of that? I would say, not overall. Obviously, if there's going to be an impact, our customers at Old Navy are going to be more sensitive to it than the others. And then finally with regard to how we're approaching our year -- and I'll interpret your question by saying how do we get to operating margin expansion, Oliver. I would say we want to be very balanced about that. So we know that 2012 was unique because we could invest so much given that we were getting the benefit on merch margins, not just from great products but also from average unit cost. 2013, we're going to use all of our levers, the 3 big ones, of course, our expense leverage, rent & occupancy leverage and merchandise margins, and we tend to approach those in a very balanced manner.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","My question is really on gross margins. At the end of 2011, merchandise margins were down, I think, 440 basis points from 2009 levels. This year, you recovered 200 basis points. So you're still about 240 basis points below peak. And I would argue that the merchandise is significantly better now than it was in 2009. So my question is, first, can you give us some sense of your full price or kind of planned promotional selling now versus 2009? And then secondly, have you seen any benefits yet from the changes you've made in your sourcing structure? And then I'll try to throw one more in. And that kind of leads to the real question of, is there any reason why gross margins can't exceed prior peak levels? It seems like there's more room with merchandise margins and with the rationalization of the store base, you should get some more buying and occupancy leverage, not to mention the fact that International and direct are becoming a bigger part of the mix.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, I understand [ph] your question. So let me try and -- let me try and hit that, Jennifer. So I think that one of the important things to remember is that 2009 for Gap was a very unique environment in terms of costing. So the underlying cotton was certainly lower in 2009 than it was in '12, and then we expect it to be in '13. So you've got an underlying commodity that's lower. You have labor that was certainly lower in 2009 than we certainly expect it to be now, with labor pressures in Asia, in 2013. So you had a very different costing environment for certain. I'd also point out in 2009, despite our high gross margin rate, we were negative comping. So obviously it is important for us to balance delivering a very healthy rate, which we are focused on, with driving healthy comps and gross margin dollars. Now that all said, we do have levers, and we are focused on delivering healthy gross margins. And as you said, first and foremost with positive comp performance, we feel confident that we'll leverage rent and occupancy. So that's a lever. And then regarding our merchandise margins with all the effort we've put against delivering strong product assortments, we have opportunities to move the needle in more reg selling. Certainly, still promotions. We'd love to draw back a little, either in frequency or depth. And then markdowns, also, with better assortments, we might have an opportunity there to not go as deep on the markdown itself. So we are focused on it, but very different than 2009.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On a, I guess, farther raging topic, sourcing, you guys have undertaken a dramatic change in your sourcing policies and practices, trying to enhance speed to market. Obviously, to manage the vagaries of the marketplace, cotton last year. I'm wondering how this multiyear initiative is going, where you stand today and what kind of promises in the future?","Glenn K. Murphy","Look, I would say we're probably in the third or fourth inning. And the big driver, Richard, the unlock for us is, we may have mentioned this in past calls, for the longest period of time, we were very focused on our vendors and some of the stuff Sabrina was just referencing, when our margin rate was fairly high in 2009. That was when we were at the peak of the recession. We were making tough choices in our business. And the choices we made back then was to really focus and negotiate and use the leverage of the company to get what is known as our cut-and-make cost down, the actual making of the garment. And that was a big focus of the business. As speed came in and speed became more important as I was talking earlier about chasing a rapid response or just actually the whole fast pipeline, which is putting new styles to work inside of a season, what the team and the new structure turned to is really fabric platforming and working upstream with our mills. So for the longest period of time, we'd worked directly with vendors, that was 99% of our relationships. And now we have a much stronger relationships with mills and fabric, first and foremost. And the way we, again, go into third or fourth inning, but the way we've got our merchants and designers to understand it is, if you want speed and you understand the gross margin upside of speed and the customer satisfaction that comes with that, the only way to be able to do that is have fabric that is ready to go. So just one example, last year, we had a very good year. When somebody was asking about categories earlier, in denim at Old Navy, one of the categories there was something we introduced called the Rockstar jeans. And the Rockstar jeans is a fabric that we developed. We platformed it and then the team in sourcing goes and negotiates as many years out to get as low a cost as possible, and it's not colored and all the team has to do is make sure that we're giving, in the moment, daily information to the vendors to make sure we're getting the right color in the right quantity to come in and fill the pipeline. We weren't able to do that 2 or 3 years ago. I think that was, I might have said this 2 or 3 years ago in a call, that was as much cultural as anything else. And as the culture has changed and evolved, I think, now people are appreciating that we have to work directly with mills, work aggressively, narrow the number of fabrics we have. Because a fabric can be treated in so many different ways. So less fabrics, work with the mills directly, have them available there as a platform opportunity, create a toolbox of fabrics and, therefore, really push the speed part. Because while I'm happy to get gross margin dollars both ways, which is lowering our cost and driving more cost sales at reg and getting more dollars coming through on the AUR side, the real benefit of speed is AUR. And that's why I think the team can hopefully, down the road, get the benefit of both, which is managing our average unit cost through the fabric platforming, but more importantly, putting more and more of our units on a faster pipeline, which all 3 brands now have and drive a higher cost sales at reg.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Glenn, just one follow-on question. Are you making a financial commitment to the mills for fabric or is it more of an understanding, a handshake, if you will?","Glenn K. Murphy","Yes, we don't get into the details of it. But I think, let's just put it this way, that mills understand that they have so much capacity and they look for companies to, obviously, eat up that capacity. So we work with our mills more than we had before, to make sure there's so many yards that we need of fabric, and I think that we've built really good relationships. A lot of the new team members we've brought in know that side of the business very well. As a matter of fact, 1 senior person came from that business. And it's what some other companies have done. I think we're trying to not only catch-up but then eventually go past them in instituting this new process in the business.","Katrina O'Connell","Great.

As always, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Art Peck","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Q3 conference call. You\u2019ve obviously seen the press release with our third quarter results which generally fell within our expectations and reflect the continued positive performance of Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta.","That said, I suspect you like we are most focused on the results of Gap brand. While the performance of Gap brand this quarter was not entirely surprising, clearly we\u2019re disappointed and we need to do better. We continue to feel the impact of last year\u2019s operational missteps in the business, but we also face more fundamental issues with the brand namely the specialty fleet.","I\u2019ll talk first about the current performance, trends, and then I\u2019ll turn to the more significant structural issues. As we said on our last call, once we identified the operational issues we made the decision to make aggressive but necessary cuts to rightsize the assortment including reducing SKU count by 30%.","The Q3 assortment was affected most dramatically as we have less flexibility to pullback units without impacting the overall assortment architecture. As such, entering Q3 we had some known imbalances in the assortment. We made these cuts intentionally and these imbalances were known. This mainly affected tops but it also impacted the assortment breadth and depth behind key styles.","For perspective, the average tops to bottom ratio is generally about 3:1 and we are at about half that in Q3. This has an impact on conversion which was more severe than we anticipated driving sharper discounts to clear inventory and position ourselves for a healthier Q4. I now have the benefit of hindsight, and with that hindsight I am still quite confident that the decisions that we made were the best financial decisions.","I want to share, however, where the assortment is in Q4 compared to Q3. Programs and CCs are down 30% providing a narrower but better architected assortment. Tops to bottom ratios have moved from about 1.7 to 2.8, which is much closer to the norm. Depth behind CCs and our key items which particularly impacts service levels is up 18%. With that, Q4 is better positioned. We expect an improvement from Q3 trends in both comp and margin and the early reads of our Q4 product flows are encouraging.","Let me take you back and review a few things about Gap brand over the last several months. In late June, we named a new brand President at Gap, Neil Fiske. Stabilizing the business has been his first priority. As you would expect, he\u2019s assessed the business, the organization, and the underlying processes and is well into developing his plans.","Over the last several weeks, we\u2019ve landed additional key leaders with impressive credentials, including, and I\u2019m very excited about this, Pam Wallack from Children's Place to lead North American specialty. This is a role similar to the one that she previously held when she was working directly for me when I was running the brand in 2012.","I\u2019m pleased with the progress that Neil is making. Importantly, the actions we\u2019re taking are the foundation for improved margin, expense reduction, and the increased profitability that is required for the brand to be a contributor to shareholder value.","Okay. All that said, the biggest challenge with Gap brand is largely a function of certain legacy elements which we understand and recognize of the brand. A big one specifically is the real estate obligations that currently encumber the business.","To be clear, the average of Gap doesn\u2019t tell the story and I want to tease the brand apart for a minute and talk about the parts. We think of it as three interrelated pieces on which we can and will make discrete decisions.","There is a healthy and growing online business which constitutes about 20% of the total revenue of the brand. There is a profitable business in the outlet space with about 500 stores globally that represents about 30% of the revenue. The remainder is the specialty business, which is currently underperforming.","The specialty store channel is also a tale of two businesses. We have 775 Gap brand specialty stores globally. On a cash basis, this part of the fleet returns a very modest contribution. But importantly, the range from the very best to the very worst stores is extremely broad.","Addressing the bottom half of the fleet could represent over $100 million of earnings contribution opportunity and it is that portion of the fleet that is dragging down the brand. This is the piece of the business that we are firmly committed to addressing with urgency.","It includes some amazing flagship stores around the world that we\u2019re evaluating with an objective eye on which ones provide sufficient value to keep. Collectively, the flags have meaningful negative contribution.","Beyond that, there are hundreds of other stores that likely don\u2019t fit our vision for the future of Gap brand specialty store, whether in terms of profitability, customer experience, traffic trends, importantly the ROD structure and\/or near and long-term relevance to the brand. These stores are a drag on the health and a drag on the performance of the brand.","At the same time, we know that stores are an important part of the customer journey. And importantly, we have a significant number of specialty and outlet stores that are cited where customers lead their lives, that have attractive four-wall economics, that operate at brand standards, that have positive trajectory and long-term relevance. It is this healthy core of the brand that we will focus on to deliver future value.","You have my commitment that while this type of strategic action on the fleet is overdue, I am going to take the action to get this one done and get this one behind us. There likely will be a cash cost to exit many of these stores, which we will attempt to minimize with appropriate sequencing. But I plan to exit those that do not fit the future vision quickly.","I\u2019m going to move thoughtfully, but aggressively. We will come back to you with more detail on our planned actions by the time we lay out our guidance for the coming fiscal year. It was important to address Gap brand first, and I want you to go back and again look at my words, but I also want to touch briefly on the great majority of our portfolio which is working and working well.","Old Navy continued its profitable sales trajectory in Q3, with 11% sales growth and four comp despite warmer-than-anticipated weather for much of the quarter. Even with weather challenges, nearly all divisions inside the brand positive comped in the quarter and product margins continued to expand, which has been true all year, demonstrating the broad-based product acceptance in the box.","In women\u2019s, dresses and woven tops, we saw some softness. It was driven by fabrication and some of the choices of print. The team recognized it and the team got on it and has largely corrected this for Q4 and going forward.","Building on strong and consistent product acceptance, store traffic at Old Navy continued to outpace industry trends. And online saw a meaningful acceleration in Q3 building momentum as we head into holiday.","I and we continue to be pleased with Old Navy\u2019s consistency and consistently positive results, the clear positioning, the connection with customers and the operational discipline.","Let me turn to Athleta. It remains a growth engine in the portfolio. During the third quarter, 95% of the Athleta business comped positively demonstrating the underlying health of the business.","Last quarter I mentioned that the girl\u2019s business was going to come out and seriously play in the back-to-school space and it did not disappoint with an over 60 comp in that business. The brand continues to see solid growth in its customer file, specifically new customers and is on track to exceed its 2018 customer acquisition goals.","While we\u2019re on the subject of active, I also wanted to briefly mention the launch of Hill City brand in October. It is very early days, so I won\u2019t spend a great deal of time on the call about the brand but the $22 billion performance lifestyle space is growing and is a key pillar of our balanced growth strategy.","We saw white space opportunities for men\u2019s premium performance active brand and paired that opportunity with our operating platform, our size, our scale and our talent. Early product feedback has been positive. Customer engagement has been very strong and we\u2019re taking advantage of the millions of visitors coming to our e-commerce platform to expose the brand to new eyeballs.","We brought Hill City to life in little over a year with a team of less than 20, something that would simply not be possible without the advantage of the underlying Gap, Inc. platform and customer base.","To round out the portfolio, Banana Republic just delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp, all while continuing to expand gross margin. I want to elaborate a little bit because I believe that the Banana Republic story is in fact quite relevant to Gap.","There are absolutely parts of Banana Republic revitalization story that we are replicating at the Gap brand. We brought Mark Breitbard back two months ago to lead the brand and similar to Neil, his early priorities was stabilize the business and assess the talent. Early on, he made a series of leadership changes in the brand across design, merchandizing and marketing.","He leveraged the best people, processes and tools from across the company as a shortcut to bring the brand back to health. That effort includes everything from the full adoption of Old Navy\u2019s product to market process to integrating Athleta\u2019s fabric technology and innovation into ready-to-wear BR product, as well as instilling operational excellence from other processes that we have built inside the company.","The changes required at Banana were not easy but we are now seeing wins in our product and in the customer experience that give us confidence in the ability of BR to deliver improved profitability and contribute meaningful to the Gap, Inc. portfolio.","Before Teri takes us through the financials, I want to take a moment to describe two critically important priorities for me as the leader of Gap, Inc. First, within the company we are continuing to build aggressively a culture of accountability. I take this very seriously and I know Teri takes this very seriously as well.","A good example is our performance this year. You saw that we continued to be committed to delivering results within our original guidance range. Clearly the year hasn\u2019t come together in quite the form that Teri and I expected it to or wanted it to, but we remain committed to responsibly delivering on the commitments that we have made to you.","Second, consistent with this effort we are focused on driving shareholder value. We believe firmly in the size and scale advantage of the Gap, Inc. platform, our strong and loyal customer base and our iconic brands. But as I have said previously many times, each brand must earn its place.","This year, our earnings are coming from our healthy brands and our expense discipline. We are focused on margin and profitability improvement not necessarily growth at Gap brand and we will take the necessary actions to bring the brand to a profitable core that unlocks shareholder value and forms the basis on which to evaluate its long-term place in our portfolio.","With that, let me turn it over to Teri to walk us through the financials for the quarter.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks, Art, and good afternoon, everyone. As Art said, although weakness at Gap brand pressured our results in Q3 we do remain encouraged by the results throughout the rest of the portfolio, including Old Navy\u2019s continued momentum, and acceleration in trends at Banana Republic, another strong quarter delivered by Athleta and the underlying expense discipline we\u2019ve demonstrated.","Turning specifically to the third quarter performance. Just as a reminder, our reported results include the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards which changed the classification of certain line items in our P&L.","For the third quarter, the presentation changes resulted in an increase of $170 million to net sales, an increase of $128 million to gross margin and $128 million increase in operating expenses.","To be helpful, we\u2019ve included a slide in our quarterly earnings presentation that details Q3 2018 results with and without these significant presentation changes from adoption and that can be found in the Investors section of gapinc.com.","So let me run through the results, starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter were $4.1 billion. This represents growth of about 2% over Q3 2017, excluding the presentation changes from the adoption of the new rev rec standard.","Comp sales were flat compared with positive three last year. Again, excluding the presentation changes from rev rec, spread for the quarter was largely driven by new store openings.","At the brand level, Old Navy had another strong quarter delivering a positive four comp and 11% sales growth. This double-digit sales growth includes 54 new stores year-to-date demonstrating strength in our runway for growth. Despite weather variability throughout the quarter, the brand continued its strong track record delivering another market share gaining quarter across all divisions.","At Gap, comp sales were down 7% against positive one last year driven by the assortment architecture issues that Art discussed. It\u2019s worth noting that at Gap brand we did see an improvement in comp trend as we moved through the quarter and the initial reads following the new holiday flow have been in line with our expectations.","Banana Republic posted its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp with a plus two comp against last year\u2019s negative one. As Art mentioned, we were pleased to see continued expansion in gross margins as the brand focuses on driving consistency, increasing productivity and reducing the breadth and depth of promotion across the assortment. We\u2019re encouraged by the positive customer response as we head into holiday.","Athleta delivered another impressive quarter with broad-based category strength. The team remains laser-focused on growing market share by continuing to provide innovative product design and a compelling customer experience.","Momentum in online also continues delivering solid double-digit growth with all brands contributing positively. We continue to focus on providing a seamless shopping experience that offers convenient capabilities on our industry leading platform. We remain confident in our goal to reach over $3.5 billion in online sales this year.","Moving to gross margins. On a reported basis, gross margin was 39.7%, a 128 million or about 160 basis points of expansion were driven by the presentation changes from revenue recognition adoption. Excluding that impact, third quarter gross margin declined 160 basis points driven by a merch margin decline of 180 basis points partially offset by 20 basis points of rent and occupancy leverage.","There are some countervailing elements to the merch margin trend, so let me walk you through the components. The underlying product margin is down about 30 basis points driven by the Gap brand which more than offset expansion at Old Navy and Banana Republic. This reflects the continued challenges in the business, but as we expected shows sequential progress to the Gap brand.","As Art mentioned, given improvements in our tops to bottoms ratio along with additional color in brand appropriate product throughout the assortment, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Gap\u2019s margin trend in Q4. The remainder of the merchandize margin deleverage was largely due to increased shipping expense.","As we mentioned last quarter, we started off our Fishkill DC with significant new automation. As we fully operationalized the new equipment and technology, we experienced pressures from increased splits for our online business, meaning more packages and higher shipping costs.","This widely affected Old Navy given their strong online performance in the third quarter and the brand\u2019s high UPT. Going forward, we would expect the Fishkill impact to moderate, although we will continue to have opportunities to optimize our shipping costs. Rent and occupancy leverage was primarily driven by the sales growth.","Moving to SG&A. On a reported basis, third quarter total operating expenses were $1.3 billion. The presentation changes from rev rec resulted in a $128 million increase in operating expenses and accounted for 190 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Excluding that impact, third quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 100 basis points exceeding our previous guidance.","We continue to make nice progress against our productivity initiative with expense discipline, particularly around discretionary and controllable expense with bonus favorability also helping to drive leverage in the quarter.","As I mentioned last quarter, internally we set a goal for the organization to identify and action $200 million in productivity savings. We remain on track to exceed that goal for the year.","As I\u2019ve discussed since initially introducing our productivity initiative, I\u2019m really pleased with the organization\u2019s adoption of this work supporting both near-term results while building a simpler, faster, more efficient organization over time.","Moving to taxes, our third quarter effective rate was 24%. This lower rate reflects a reduction in our fiscal year '17 TCJA transition, tax, liability due to recently released IRS guidance and finalization of calculations for our federal tax return.","With better visibility to the adjustments to these provisional estimates for TCJA, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 25%. We\u2019ll continue to analyze our tax return positions under TCJA as guidance is released and we\u2019ll finalize our provisional estimates in Q4.","For completeness, I do have to remind you that adjustments to these provisional amounts, for additional guidance, technical corrections or new legislation could materially impact our Q4 and annual tax rate.","For earnings, our third quarter earnings per share was $0.69, including about $0.03 of benefit from the lower tax rate versus our expectations compared to earnings per share of $0.58 last year.","FX was a benefit of about $0.01 for the quarter and $0.03 year-to-date. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect a $0.04 benefit from FX for the year versus our original guidance of $0.07 benefit.","Regarding cash flow, our year-to-date cash flow was $57 million compared with $197 million last year, which included $60 million of insurance proceeds related to property and equipment.","Lower free cash flow year-over-year was driven by an increase in capital spending and a lower bonus accrual in 2018. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.","With regard to the earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, as you know the volume and impact of the fourth quarter is substantial and our performance in the quarter is important to our delivery of the year.","While challenges at Gap brand have continued to impact our performance beyond our original expectations, the underlying fundamentals of the other brands remain strong and we\u2019ve been able to leverage our portfolio consistent with our strategic priorities to deliver the first three quarters of the year largely in line with our expectations.","Given this, along with the benefit from a lower tax rate offset by FX, we are narrowing our full year earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.60. As a reminder, our annual guidance range includes the negative impact from the loss of the 53-week of about $0.06.","Just as the first quarter benefitted from the calendar shift, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted both from the shift in the calendar and the loss of the 53rd week. We continue to expect the spread between comp and total sales in the fourth quarter to be negative.","Additionally, given the impact of having one less week in the fourth quarter and the calendar shift, we expect deleverage in rent and occupancy in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect meaningful expense leverage in the fourth quarter despite headwinds from the loss of the 53rd week as we lap some unique incremental spend in the fourth quarter of last year that we do not expect to recur.","We continue to expect full year comp sales to be flat to up slightly with a modest positive strength. Given the way the year has unfolded, I thought it might be helpful to have a little more specificity on the expected composition of Q4 revenues. Based on current projections, we would expect Gap brand to show sequential progress but still be down for the year. A good estimate is probably closer to the first half trend.","We expect Old Navy to continue its strength, building on an amazing 9% comp last year and forecasted to deliver sequential progress from Q3 with another double-digit two-year comp. Banana Republic strength is expected to continue also with sequential progress. And finally we expect strong Athleta trends to continue.","Before I \u2013 let me go back to the balance sheet. I realized that I didn\u2019t cover inventory and finish off our cash. So starting with cash, we did continue our commitment to returning cash to shareholders by completing an additional $100 million of share repurchases during the quarter.","We ended the quarter with 382 million shares outstanding. And year-to-date, we paid dividends of 281 million and currently have a dividend yield nearly 4%. On the inventory front, we ended the quarter with inventory up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2017.","Similar to last quarter, Old Navy, which represents about half of our total inventory, is carrying higher balances to support new growth. Additionally, at the Gap brand to mitigate some of the lateness we experienced in the first half, we intentionally made the decision to increase the dwell time of inventory in our DCs ahead of the important holiday season.","This resulted in a pull forward of receipts and an increase in the brands ending inventory balance. Together, new store growth and the intentional decision to increase dwell time for Gap brand represent about half of the total inventory increase. The remaining increase positions us well for holiday and we feel comfortable with the composition of our inventory heading into Q4.","Regarding capital and store count, year-to-date capital expenditures were $510 million. We have reduced our expected capital spending for the year to be about 750 million versus our original guidance of 800 million.","Year-to-date, we\u2019ve opened 109 company-operated stores, largely Old Navy and Athleta, while closing 56 stores primarily Gap and Banana Republic. We ended the quarter with 3,218 company-operated stores.","We continue to expect 25 net new stores, but we now expect Old Navy to open about 70 stores versus our previous guidance of about 60 while accelerating the closure of some additional Gap brand stores.","With the balance sheet finished, let me close out here. As Art mentioned, we have significant work underway on the Gap brand both operationally and more strategically to identify and action the more radical but necessary steps to unlock shareholder value by establishing a healthy core business from which we can profitably grow.","We understand the nature of the problem. We have some but not all of the initiatives in place to get the brand back on stable footing and we\u2019re in process to evaluate all possible options to make the hard decisions and deliver the right results to our shareholders.","So with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Please limit yourself to one question. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Great. On margins, what\u2019s the embedded expectation for merchandise margins in the fourth quarter? And I guess larger picture, how best to think about freight and wage pressure relative to this year as we think beyond?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, so we typically don\u2019t guide to that level of specificity, but I know that we were kind of closing in on the end of the year I can tell you just \u2013 as you look at the full year given the trends through the first three quarters, we don\u2019t expect to have an expansion of gross margin on the year. We do expect sequential progress. And it really does come down to some of these shipping trends that we talked about more so than actual product margin beyond what we\u2019ve seen in the Gap brand. So that\u2019s general guidelines as you think about the remainder of the year and the full year look.","Minimum wage, this is one where we tend to be ahead of minimum wage actions. I think it\u2019s well over 70% of our employees are paid at market wage today which means we\u2019re already well ahead of that. We typically have been \u2013 it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve been investing in automation in the DCs is it does allow us to drive productivity as an offset to some of those minimum-wage pressures. So, so far, particularly in 2018, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of pressure. Same with the transportation. Is that the other part of what you asked, Matt?","Art Peck","Well, the freight and the splits I think was part of that. If I go to that on the freight and splits from an overall just factor standpoint, we\u2019re not seeing significant pressure in freight expense. What Teri highlighted, Matt, was that as we brought Fishkill up and we were managing fulfillment direct to consumer from different pools of inventory, we did see what we believe is a relatively momentary thing around packaged splits because of how we were bringing it up at the end of the day. And we\u2019re very much on it.","We\u2019re very much focused on managing packaged economics. We\u2019ve done an excellent job of that over time. And particularly as we are also working to be able to light up the ability to take orders on proximate inventory that will help us down that path, which is something we\u2019re focused on bringing up to speed next year as well. So we think it\u2019s more temporary than anything permanent.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Good afternoon. Thank you. Teri, just first clarifying the comment you made on the Old Navy comp in Q4. Is your expectation to show sequential improvement relative to the plus 4% reported in Q3, or was that sequential improvement specifically referencing the two-year stack?","Teri List-Stoll","Well, actually both, but more focused on the sequential improvement over the Q3\/Q4 comp.","Mark Altschwager","Got it. Thank you. And then circling back on your comments on Gap specialty, the bottom half of the fleet that you mentioned, the 350 plus stores, I guess how quickly do you think you can exit those? And what does the comp trajectory look like in the top half of the fleet as it sits today?","Art Peck","Yes. Let me answer the first question first, which is it\u2019s still a mixed comp trajectory. But the important thing to think about, and I\u2019m giving you proportional numbers. We\u2019re still doing the work and we haven\u2019t made any decisions to figure out exactly where we\u2019re going to go with this. And obviously our landlords are our partners also in moving down this path.","The best way to really think about that top half is those are stores that we believe will do today have a four-wall return that allows us to operate them profitably and to continue to reinvest in those stores appropriate to maintain them to brand standards. We have had a lot of stores that are in the bottom half of the fleet that have continued to deteriorate over time.","And it is my strong belief that we\u2019ve kicked the can down the road on this and offered a deteriorating customer experience and it does have a negative effect on the health of the brand. As to comp trends, we have some of those bad stores that are comping positively but that could be local circumstances. A lot of them were negative. But the trends overall are more positive in the upper half than they are in the bottom half.","Mark Altschwager","That\u2019s helpful. Best of luck over holiday.","Art Peck","Let me add one more thing too. Again, because we have at times kind of crossed our fingers and hope to grow our way out of the problem. As we look to getting Gap brand to a place where it creates shareholder value, we are not building a plan here that assumes all of a sudden a miracle happens and we start positively comping and we get a profound expansion of the margin and we grow our way out of the problem at the end of the day. I have my hands as does Teri on things that are structurally addressable that have a set of consequences and a set of outcomes associated with them. Of course, I am always hopeful that as we improve the product and get our marketing in line, et cetera, that we start to get positive lift out of the business. But I believe we owe our customers and our shareholders better as we put a plan together here to address the structural changes that we can make, a lot of which is again around really getting on the fleet and getting this done and getting it behind us.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks, again.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll hear next from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the merchandise margin and the buckets that you had, it seems like the Gap brand was the negative impact to the merchandise margin. What did you see and how did it compare to the other quarters this year of expansion at Old Navy and Banana Republic and how are you thinking about that going forward? Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","So if I understood the question, Dana, so on the Gap brand itself as we\u2019ve said we have seen this sequential progress that we expected in the brand although it\u2019s still negative versus the prior year. So obviously more work to do. But we do feel good about where we\u2019re set up for Q4 and then obviously going into 2019 for that continued progress. As I think about the other brands, we \u2013 Banana in particular has really been on a very consistent and positive trend both with delivering the positive comps but importantly delivering the margin expansion ahead of that comp sales growth. And the same with Old Navy. It just continues to be very healthy and strong with the market share growth that I talked about and the good focus on product margin expansion.","Dana Telsey","And how is the Old Navy plus size doing and if you see other category expansion opportunities for Old Navy to continue to grow? Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes, I\u2019m glad you asked. As you know, Dana, it\u2019s very early days in plus size and we put it in a limited number of stores, roughly about 75 stores, because we wanted to get it right before we committed a huge inventory bag and rolled it out across the fleet. And so we\u2019re in learning mode right now. I hope by this time and as long as we\u2019ve known each other that one of the things you should know about me is test, test, test until you get it right and then put the hammer down. And so we are still in learning mode. There is nothing, however, in our experience so far in the stores that we have put the product in that suggests anything other than we have a significant opportunity here and the customers are really responding to it.","Operator","And moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Randy Konik with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. Art, a big change in your statement putting that stake in the ground to really address the Gap division which I really appreciate, I think the market will appreciate that. Just back on the idea of pace, if you could give us maybe some perspective on your vision on your pace to completion or duration to completion on getting this done, just trying to get a sense of do you think this is a one-year, two-year, three-year \u2013 what type of timeframe are we looking toward in getting these closures out of the way from a Gap division standpoint? And then I have a follow up.","Art Peck","Yes, as we said and Teri reiterated and I did also, Randy, we\u2019re going to give you more information as we get towards wrapping up the year because we are still doing the work right now. And as you can imagine \u2013 so I\u2019m going to frustrate you a little bit because \u2013 but I will say sooner rather than later is what is on my mind. Obviously, our landlords are involved in this and they\u2019re very important partners in figuring out how we move down this path. And so we\u2019ll be having conversations with them about it as well.","But in saying all that, I do believe that it has been a significant issue and a drag on this business by the incremental year-over-year-over-year approach that we have taken. And I am committed to moving much more aggressively than that at the end of the day. I think it\u2019s stating the obvious that it\u2019s somewhat unsaid that we have a store that is rundown, does not present the product in a respectful way to our customers, that is not a positive brand experience and we believe and I believe quite strongly it does impact the brand.","So I\u2019m anxious to get this done and get it behind us as soon as possible. But there are financial consequences. We do have our landlord partners in the tent with us on this one, so we have a lot of work to do to figure out how to pace it. But urgency is on my mind.","Randy Konik","Got it. And then when you think about partnering with Neil, how you kind of instructed him to kind of focus on product architecture, pricing architecture, marketing, brand positioning, et cetera, while you kind of focus with the troops on the real estate side? Just curious on how you guys want to kind of attack this. And then, Teri, is there anything you can give us in perspective on \u2013 as you laid out that the outlet business is about $1.5 billion business, the e-com business is about \u2013 I\u2019m talking about Gap brand; Gap e-com is about $1 billion revenue business it sounds like and Gap outlet is about $1.5 billion revenue business. Is there any kind of perspective on maybe not giving us the exact margins of those businesses, but maybe how they are different from maybe the specialty part of the Gap brand just to give us some perspective on just how much profit margins can improve as this company really undertakes this strategy to close the unproductive real estate, just curious there? Thanks.","Art Peck","Yes, let me take a shot at this one and by the way that was three questions, but we\u2019ll let you off the hook this time.","Teri List-Stoll","And also it reminded me how many of you know that children\u2019s book if you give a mouse a cookie, like we gave you a split, Randy, and now you want margins by channel of a brand.","Art Peck","Let me address it more honestly. We\u2019re not ready to break that out right now. But Teri and I both believe and we\u2019ve heard this message in talking to many of you face-to-face that there\u2019s value in greater transparency here and we want to make sure that we do that in an appropriate way. We obviously did a bit of an unveil a year ago at September and we want to continue to do that. I will say I believe that you are appropriately you and everyone is filling in the blanks and we want to make sure that some of those blanks potentially get filled in more accurately and really reflect the true profit composition of the company across brands and channels and the geographies. So we\u2019re going to move down that path. But at this moment, I don\u2019t want to go into a much greater level of detail.","On the split between Neil and me, I would say we\u2019re pretty much together here. That said, Neil\u2019s in the building and he is, as you said, really focused on what is impactable today in terms of product assortments. We mentioned the functional equities of the brand on making sure his team is in place. And I am really excited to have him in the building. I think Pam and Neil have gotten to know each other. She will be an excellent complement to the skills that Neil has. And worked for me and was just terrific in managing the overall product process and P&L, so I\u2019m excited to have her back. We\u2019re together on this real estate one as you can imagine, but this has bigger and more strategic consequences for the company in total since our relationships with our landlords are all cross brands. So that is a place where Teri and I and our central real estate team are running some interference for Neil.","Randy Konik","Great. Thanks, guys.","Teri List-Stoll","We mentioned it in the script, as you think about this specialty channel vis-\u00e0-vis the others, you can sort of \u2013 with the data we provided last fall, you can kind of put together the pieces and understand when we say it\u2019s underperforming what that means. And if we really can\u2019t address this bottom half performance, as we said there\u2019s $100 million of contribution benefit there, so that gives you a sense of between that and then the right-sizing of the overhead structure of the brand and then margin improvement. You can see the path quite easily too, a smaller but certainly more profitable core.","Art Peck","And just to be clear again because I\u2019m not sure everybody heard us is that it\u2019s not about growth here right now. I do believe there is growth in this brand but we\u2019re not building a plan that\u2019s predicated on growing our way out of the problem. We are building a plan that\u2019s predicated on making structural changes that bring the P&L structure more in line and deliver an improvement in profitability and that\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to deliver. It\u2019s the last time you get to ask three questions.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. Please go ahead.","Marni Shapiro","Hi, guys. Best of luck for the holiday in case I forget and I won\u2019t ask three questions. I\u2019m just curious if you guys could address at the Gap brand, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the real estate, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the product, little less about the marketing, but I guess is the problem at the Gap brand weakness across all of the categories? So is it hitting kids and men and active and women\u2019s fashion and intimates? Is it hitting outlets and street locations and mall locations and international the same?","If you could just give us \u2013 is there any variances I guess within the store itself and then within the locations that would give us a better idea of understanding? Because it sounds like online you\u2019re getting a good reception which you\u2019re online assortment are a little more focused, a little bit more fashion, that leads me to think that maybe your fashion customer is still coming in. I\u2019m trying to figure out where the weakness really is coming from?","Art Peck","Yes. So I would point out that just because you don\u2019t put a period at the end of all of these sentences, you still bundled several questions there because really it was very clever. So let me tease that apart a little bit. Outlet performs consistently and it performs consistently frankly across all categories and profitably in all locations. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that the product has been more consistent and is getting better and the broad structure of the business allows for a four-wall out of each store that delivers at the end of the day. And I would focus the attention, because this is part of what we\u2019re focused on here is the wide structure inside the P&L. And so there are some differences but they really are not meaningful differences. The story is more about consistency than not.","Online, the advantage online is that we have the ability to curate and present the product where we\u2019re actually able to overcome some of the issues around assortment balance and those kinds of things and present the product not entirely consistent with ownership, if that makes sense, so we can tweak it a little bit. When you get to a specialty store, you would have seen in Q3, specialty in women\u2019s it was super flat. We were bottoms heavy.","We really took \u2013 a lot of the things we took out of the assortment, some poly, dizzy-print blouses and some other things didn\u2019t belong in there in the first place. That ended up taking some of the color out of the assortment. When we flowed the holiday flow, you would have seen in an average store almost 90-day in terms of the balance of the assortment tops to bottoms as well as some excitement in the assortment with a more sophisticated crazy stripe presented upfront in the first 20 feet and then far fewer CCs and styles, as I referenced, which allows our bigger ideas to cut through.","And if you go, then dig down into it, it\u2019s clich\u00e9 but if you don\u2019t have a women\u2019s business that\u2019s checking, you don\u2019t have a business and the biggest issues have been in the women\u2019s business. Kids and baby has been solid. We have strength in the intimates business. The active business kind of chugs along and then men\u2019s business is going to be a reflection of the women\u2019s business, but it has not had the same weakness nor did we make the same inventory cuts in the men\u2019s business. So not all the energy is exclusively focused on women\u2019s but we need a healthy women\u2019s business which is what the whole business then sits underneath from an umbrella standpoint.","Teri List-Stoll","And an improved women\u2019s business, it\u2019s easy to see where that $100 million can come through because the women\u2019s business should in part lift all of these sub-businesses even further, because they\u2019re not even going the wrong direction today.","Art Peck","They move behind but they are solid. If you look at kids and baby, the baby and toddler business is super solid. Girl\u2019s has been a little softer. Boy\u2019s is strong. We just go through that way. So yes, the idea is on restoring the health of the women\u2019s business.","Marni Shapiro","That\u2019s great. Best of luck for holiday, guys.","Art Peck","Yes, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you can talk about the Gap and who the target consumer is, how you can tap into the millennial with sort of the buying power? And Old Navy did a fantastic job of really defining, articulating and then going right after that. So just wondering if we\u2019re fixing the result of the problem as opposed to if you could address sort of the crux of it which is the demand side? Teri, I wonder if you can help us just parameters for 2019. We\u2019re hearing a lot from other companies. Just as guidelines; wage pressure, freight pressure, AUR and just wondering if you can give us some help there directionally. Thank you very much.","Art Peck","Yes, on the first point I think it\u2019s a good point. I like to think about what\u2019s the addressable market space for a category by price point for our brands and that is the starting point for understanding where we believe the brand can play. Here\u2019s what I would say answering your question on Gap brand. I do believe that the specialty space that Gap occupied when we had close to 1,100 stores in North America that that space has contracted somewhat. And some of that has gone to value; some may have gone to premium.","Part of right-sizing the fleet and frankly walking away from some significant amount of unprofitable top line is recognizing the size of the market that Gap can play in. Now that all said, if you look at the information by category, by price point, our businesses, all of them, still operate in the low to mid-single digit share positions and I do believe that we have ample opportunity to continue to play. So is it addressing \u2013 is it the outcome? I don\u2019t think it actually is.","I think, Adrienne, a big part of this issue is \u2013 and again, it\u2019s been sort of the unspoken but clear moves on the table is we have stores that we have allowed to continue to age in locations that have also continued to age. And at some point those stores become toxic to the health of the business and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re stepping up and addressing here right now.","At the same time I can show you, as I said, a significant number of stores that are in locations that are fresh and relevant and current for the consumer that are generating very nice consistent four-wall contributions, are very healthy, have a significant component of known customers that shop there. So we have proof points about the health of the core and we know what the dots are that we can act on the unhealthy component of the fleet as well. And I think the lesser effect is just overall market size and the greater effect is wrong stores in the wrong location that were too big and have run down.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Mindshare --","Art Peck","Sorry.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Is there a risk that you lose mindshare as you shrink the footprint?","Art Peck","I don\u2019t think you lose mindshare on Gap brand. I think there is a risk that you don\u2019t recapture some of these sales. And again, I\u2019m not saying never that we wouldn\u2019t backfill some stores, but right now what I\u2019m telling you and I want everybody to hear is this is not a growth story. This is a contract to improve overall profitability and return on invested capital story.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Brian Tunick","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess maybe one for Teri on the SG&A opportunities beyond the 200 million this year, there are other buckets or other points of leverage going forward. And maybe Art could talk a little about sort of Old Navy, curious \u2013 you\u2019re obviously optimistic already about how the quarter started, but curious about Q4 lapping last year\u2019s 9%. Are there marketing or product initiatives you\u2019re most excited about? And then longer term, what are the puts and takes to Old Navy\u2019s mid to high-teen operating margins potentially getting higher? Thanks very much.","Teri List-Stoll","So what order do you want to take those questions?","Art Peck","Go for it.","Teri List-Stoll","So the first question was about SG&A and how we feel about it. Having the leverage this quarter of 100 basis points, looking for leverage next quarter as well and being ahead of our goal of 200 million on the year are all good positive indicators. But it isn\u2019t the end of the story. We really do see a lot of runway ahead to continue to drive productivity. A lot of what we\u2019re seeing this year is just good old fashion expense discipline and low-hanging fruit as we improve processes quite simplistically to be honest.","And what we haven\u2019t really gotten the benefit yet is the broader reengineering efforts that will not only make our processes more efficient but also more effective, so there\u2019s a real benefit there and those are projects that take a little longer to implement and get rolled down the organization. So that\u2019s kind of year two plan to work against the $500 million in total savings that we laid out. And frankly, as I\u2019ve said before, I think there\u2019s probably more than that available to us as we look forward. So I think for us productivity is a multiyear journey and I think we\u2019ll see continued benefit there.","Art Peck","And then on Old Navy\u2019s margin, that was the other question, do we expect to see improvement?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, as we think about it, Old Navy is very much focused on how do you drive its margin levers, which is a variety of things from mix to AUR improvement to AUC discipline. So we do see continued levers for product margin expansion at Old Navy. We\u2019ve demonstrated that and it\u2019s a clear focus. Obviously, a big piece of that is continuing to drive yield which we\u2019ve been investing in some proprietary tools and work to help accommodate. So it is top of mind for the brand and we don\u2019t see any major --","Art Peck","The only thing I would say here is that I think there\u2019s a sense sometimes that I run into that Old Navy is sort of defining the odds and running perfect right now, which is why I included the fact that we did have some issues in the assortment with that, and there will be those occasional issues where we get a print wrong or a silhouette wrong or we miss a trend. Old Navy has continued to deliver and deliver consistently. So our investment thesis in Old Navy is not based upon continuing perfection. It\u2019s based upon solid operating discipline that delivers consistently quarter-over-quarter. And as Teri said, as we continue to do that, we do see opportunities to continue to drive some expansion of margin at the end of the day in a number of different ways.","Brian Tunick","Art, anything about fourth quarter here at Old Navy what you\u2019re most excited about lapping against the 9%?","Art Peck","Yes, the 9% was like a big number, but if you go \u2013 I think I\u2019m getting this right is that over the last couple of years we\u2019ve had a big number in December or a big number in November and what we\u2019ve demonstrated is that we can deliver the quarter between the three months that we have and deliver it with consistency. So I think to your stack as we said, we\u2019re pretty confident in being able to deliver very solid two-year stack for the quarter. Early indications on the product assortment are strong.","Obviously we\u2019re coming into Black Friday and Cyber Monday and then the rush to Christmas. Weather is always a factor but everybody plays the weather card at the end of the day. So I\u2019m optimistic from what we see. I don\u2019t see structural issues in the assortment, I don\u2019t see trends that we\u2019re not playing in. I see us properly loaded with respect to inventory. The stores are fired up and ready to deliver. And then as of tomorrow, I\u2019m out in the stores for the next five days. So ask me after that.","Teri List-Stoll","The only thing I would say is Old Navy has cozy done right this year; cozy socks and jammies. It\u2019s the place to be. I think we have one more question.","Operator","And our last question will come from Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Chethan Mallela","Hi. Good afternoon. So I think you cited some negative impacts from warm weather on the Old Navy comp in the third quarter. I\u2019m just curious. As the quarter progressed and the weather cooled if there was any sort of progression or change in that trend? And then as a follow up; in the slides it looks like the overall company underperformed the industry on traffic in the third quarter and I think you had outperformed on that metric since at least the beginning of 2017. So maybe just discuss what drove that and how you\u2019re thinking about relative traffic performance during the holiday period?","Art Peck","Yes, so on the weather thing, again, it\u2019s stating what everybody knows. But as you get into the fall assortment, I think the weather turned cold and ideally being relatively dry gets people into stores and gets people to start shopping for seasonal items. Now the overcorrection that I experienced last Thursday in New York of that very early wet snowstorm, that doesn\u2019t help. The general trends we see from long-term forecast would suggest that they are going to be positive which is relatively cool and relatively dry through most of the cold parts of the country, which should support the business. On the traffic trend, I would focus really on the longer-term trend and what we\u2019ve consistently delivered quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. I\u2019m less concerned about a short-term aberration than they are about the consistency of what they\u2019ve delivered. And what I\u2019m seeing with respect to product acceptance as we lit up Q4. I don\u2019t know Teri if you want to add anything on that?","Teri List-Stoll","The only thing I\u2019d add about this most recent quarter is obviously we\u2019ve had quite a significant negative traffic impact from the Gap brand for the issues that we talked about. And then even if the Banana, and this is a good thing at the end of the day, as we\u2019ve been thoughtfully and intentionally pulling back on promotions a little bit, that can have an impact on traffic. It\u2019s a fair tradeoff when you are still getting the comp and you\u2019re getting the gross margin expansion. As Art said, we look at the longer term. But in this quarter particular those were two of the more significant factors that would have --","Art Peck","Yes, especially on Old Navy and Banana as well, I don\u2019t see warning bells right now. I am not seeing alarm bells going off. Quite the contrary. Okay.","Teri List-Stoll","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference.

First, this is a pivotal time for the company and taking on the role as Interim President and CEO of Gap, Inc. is incredibly important to me.","Over the past 35 plus years in various roles here, from merchandising and general management to Chairman of the Board, I have gained a deep understanding of our company operations and the retail space. I\u2019m deeply and personally committed to the success of the company and I\u2019m approaching the role with both a clear view of where we are and urgency about where we need to go.","While I\u2019m confident about our future, I'm also realistic about the challenges ahead. Clearly our brands are underperforming today and have been pressured by uneven execution. The diverging priorities of our two largest brands, coupled with the overall complexity that has been building up in the organization over time has led to a lack of focus, operational discipline and efficiency in many areas. To ensure we\u2019re appropriately assessing the business, making the difficult decisions and taking the necessary action to improve our operational execution, I'm constituting an executive committee that will streamline operating decisions and drive better accountability during this interim period. Sonia Syngal and Mark Breitbard will be responsible for brand leadership, Teri will add operational oversight to her role, and our Global General Counsel, Julie Gruber will consolidate administrative oversight.","We\u2019re fortunate that a strong bench of talented leaders supporting me in driving operational excellence and greater efficiency that will help position us for improved profitability. To that end, the board and I continue to believe in the strategic rationale of the separation and the benefits it is expected to provide.","First, the focus provided by separation will enable both Gap, Inc. and Old Navy to better serve their two distinct customer sets, each with an operating model tailored to their respective business needs. Old Navy is competing with companies that have a singular focus on winning in the value space. We need Sonia and her team to have that same focus. Second, the separation will be a catalyst to drive improved cost and efficiency as we rebuild the organizational structure and operating models for both companies. Both companies will benefit from this but new Gap, Inc. in particular will have renewed urgency and catalyst to reinvent how it operates. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the separation will better empower each company to fully embark upon its unique path for growth and in the case of our mature brands path towards enhanced profitability.","This empowerment will come with the increased accountability of a standalone public company and the employees will benefit from the direct alignment of their performance to the value creation it creates. As we move forward with the work to prepare for separation, we remain confident in the value creation opportunities it presents inclusive of our current view of the business and the expected cost of the transaction. We plan to take the necessary time needed to make sure that both companies are positioned for success. And we\u2019re committed to providing transparency at every step of the way.","Lastly, I am sure that you will have several questions around our search for a permanent CEO. So I will quickly address them now. It has been only two weeks since our announcement. So I will not be providing any specific search criteria updates today. I\u2019ll share that we plan to move with urgency but also thoughtfully considering both internal and external candidates to ensure that we find the most qualified person for this role. As the board evaluates potential successors, our focus will be on strong leadership candidates with operational excellence that can lead a creative organization with greater efficiency, speed, and profitability. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Teri.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks, Bob. As we shared a few weeks ago, Q3 was a challenging quarter, the traffic trends remained soft across our brand, along with continued product acceptance challenges, particularly at Old Navy. I'll start with an overview of performance by brand before getting into the specifics of the quarter. Starting with Old Navy. While we're not pleased with our performance we entered the quarter knowing we would face headwinds particularly around traffic. As we discussed with you last quarter history has shown us that traffic rebounds typically lag product acceptance improvement, as such traffic remains challenging throughout the quarter.","With regards to product, while we believe we have correctly diagnosed our women's product issues, we have identified opportunities for better execution, particularly in the areas of marketing and merchandising. To this end, we have added a new Chief Creative Officer role that leads these two critical areas and acts as a direct link to our Brand President. While our Chief Creative Officer\u2019s full vision will likely not be realized until next year, the brand strong bench of creative talent has been hard at work incorporating learnings from Q3 into holiday plans. Looking ahead, we have an opportunity to better execute on Old Navy's unique value equation and positioning, with style, fit, quality and price, all working in balance.","Focusing on Old Navy's Q4 plans, we believe that we are better positioned for the holiday season given that we were able to fully infuse key learnings and insights from Holiday 2018 into our plans. It's also important to note that three key categories we began leaning into this fall Denim, Fleece and Active continue to outperform the overall brand in terms of sales and margin comps and we have gained market share in Denim.","Regarding marketing, we had frankly become too heavily dependent on messaging around discounting, as opposed to bigger picture brand messaging focus on product and value that we know resonates with the Old Navy consumer. For Q4, we recalibrated our messaging to focus on product stories, highlighting some of our big design ideas for holiday, such as plaids, puffers and Jingle Jammies combined with compelling price points and commercial plans, which is more reflective of Old Navy's winning value equation.","Additionally, we have strategically increased our marketing investments, which include exciting new partnerships and campaigns. For example, earlier this month, we launched our Holiday TV campaign, featuring Neil Patrick Harris, and early test results have been some of the most positive we have ever seen from our iconic celebrity led campaign.","Also, this season Old Navy is the exclusive retail partner for Netflix's first ever animated family holiday movie, Klaus. This partnership includes character inspired products, in-store activations, and augmented reality experiences that will bring the movie to life for those who shop in Old Navy stores this season.","While we believe we've made the necessary pivots in terms of marketing and execution holiday, and are encouraged by the trends we have been seeing as the weather turned, we remain cautiously optimistic acknowledging that much of the season still lies ahead.","Before I turn to the other brands, I want to acknowledge a difficult decision made by management and the Board with regards to Old Navy's operations in China. As we continue to increase focus on investments that yield the best returns, we've made the decision to exit Old Navy from China in early 2020. The investment needed to grow the business would be significant. And we see greater value creation opportunities by focusing on other higher returns strategies, such as increasing our digital capability and continuing to invest in the proven growth opportunity in underserved North American market.","Our views on the fundamental strength of the business and the power of the Old Navy brand remain unchanged. The brand has maintained its position as the number two apparel brand and number nine apparel retailer in the U.S. We're holding our market share 3%, meaning we have tremendous opportunity for growth to category focus and expansion, giving customers more access, acquiring new customers to personalization and loyalty and driving online growth.","Through successful execution of our strategic priorities, we look forward to the business returning to the growth rates, we know it can deliver.","Now turning to Gap, as it's been the case all year, the team continues to focus on profitability, primarily through improved product assortment and inventory composition, as well as reduced promotional activity. Similar to last quarter, we saw positive sales over traffic across all channels, indicating continuing improvement in customer response to product. Q3 was the third consecutive quarter with improved margin rates versus last year. Recall it in 2018, we saw sequential improvement in margin rate as we move through the year.","Given the first half compares were relatively easy, we were pleased to see margin expansion continue in the third quarter ahead of our expectations. In fact, this was the first quarter where all major product divisions women's, men's, and kids and baby delivered margin expansion, and the first quarter with positive global AUR growth.","During Q3, we reduced the number of all box discount events both in-stores and online versus last year, and we converted to more flexible promotional messaging, focusing on an up to a certain percent off as opposed to blanket promotions on all products. We also made strides towards closing the gap between in-store and online promotional activity. We believe that this pricing transparency will build customers confidence that they\u2019re receiving the best possible price no matter what channel they choose to shop, ultimately helping to boost Gap\u2019s overall brand image. Separately and as discussed during prior calls, The Gap brand has been focused on reestablishing its authority in denim and its work really came to life with our Fall launch, supported by the \u201cIt\u2019s Our Denim Now\u201d marketing campaign at the end of August.","The response particularly in women's has been strong, with global denim sales and margins both comping positively in the quarter. Despite these positives, we still have much work ahead to restore profitability to the Gap brand. The margin rate improvement has not been sufficient to offset the negative revenue trends and leverage the cost structure. Going forward we will continue to focus on how we can best leverage the process and marketing improvement that delivered pockets of improvement in Q3.","We will also continue to transform the operating model with an eye towards the goal of dramatically increasing GMROI. Moving to Banana Republic, overall our Q3 results were disappointing. Our minus three comp simply didn't reflect the sequential improvements that we had expected coming into the quarter. Sales were challenged due to some product softness particularly related to warmer than anticipated weather, as well as a sub-optimal mix in key sizes as the brand works to fully implement a new inventory management tool.","We also sold through some key fashion items quickly and we're over invested in basic styles. One of Banana\u2019s top priorities is to increase profitability by reducing the promotional levels the brand had migrated to in the past, when product acceptance was not strong. With improved product and leaner inventories now is the time to retrain our customers by implementing a more strategic promotional strategy that balances the need to drive traffic but also improve yields. This is a journey that will take some time as we evaluate the levers including the extensive nature of marketing investments, and implications necessary to optimize growth and profitability.","Bigger picture, we're continuing to engage with our consumers in new ways. For example, our recently launched rental business that is relevant for our overall P&L has attracted a larger following than planned and it's already providing valuable insight into customers. We have amassed 7,000 rental customers to our e-mail list and we're pleased to see that a large number of signups are coming from new customers to the brand. Also BOPIS has been fully rolled out to our BR fleet as of Q3 and already makes up nearly 5% of online sales.","Before I turn to slide, I wanted to provide some color around some of the movement within the other sales category in the net sales table within our press release. You'll recall that with the revenue recognition changes last year, a portion of our credit card income is now reported in other sales. While the majority falls within the brand net sales, I'm sorry these presentation changes can cause volatility in the other sales category, which are not reflective of the performance of our overall credit card program.","We don't disclose the specifics of the program, it is worth noting that the total credit card revenue was higher year-to-date. I will now turn to Athleta first, I want to welcome Mary Beth Laughton, who joined as President and CEO of Athleta in September. Mary Beth who was most recently at Sephora brings a strong background and proven track record of results in both digital and in-store operations.","We welcome her insights and are confident that she is the right leader as the brand continues upon its path towards $2 billion in revenues. Regarding Q3 performance for Athleta, it continues to be a brand with tremendous growth potential. During the quarter, we grew market share and maintained strong performance in key franchise collections like Powervita, City and Hybrid. Our girls business continued to be a consistent growth lever, delivering another double-digit comp quarter. That said, we did see some softness in the business at the start of the quarter, which we quickly diagnosed as largely being associated with two levers in-store traffic and assortment mix.","Regarding in-store traffic, we believe this was impacted by some changes we made to our marketing messaging invite how our in-store product was displayed, both of which has since been corrected for Q4. Given Athleta\u2019s lower brand awareness as compared to our other brands, we have been increasing marketing investments and are still working to refine our messaging in a way that drives both in-store and online traffic.","On the assortment presentation, there were two issues. First our initial Q3 flows were more Fall forward in color and weight, which didn't work well, particularly in light of the warmer weather at the start of the quarter. Additionally, the assortment mix over index to performance were at the expense of lifestyle. We've taken immediate steps to rebalance our product assortment in Q4 towards a more appropriate mix of performance, which has historically made up around 50% of our total versus the 60% in Q3.","As weather shifted in October, we saw improving trends in-stores with positive indicators, such as higher average transaction and improving sales over traffic. And we're optimistic about carrying this momentum into Q4. We feel good about our holiday gifting assortment and added an additional flow to insert newness and give our customer a reason to keep coming in and shopping with us throughout the season.","Looking ahead, our team remains focused and growing market share and continues to believe that our inclusive brand positioning, unique product offering and high touch experiential store service model sets us up to win in this competitive retail landscape. We've accelerated store openings to around 30 this year, in line with our strategy to accelerate growth and we now expect to end the year with 190 Athleta stores.","Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year in fiscal 2019, we now expect net sales to decline low single digits versus prior guidance of flat and comp sales to decline mid-single digits versus prior guidance of low single digits. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.47 for the full-year. We continue to expect restructuring related costs to be about $0.14. We remain on track to close about 230 specialty stores by the end of 2020, with about 130 store closures completed in 2019 and we continue to expect total cost of the program to be about $250 million to $300 million with the majority expected to be cash expenditures.","That said, our discussions with landlords around closures continue to be challenging. Given the challenges associated with our specialty fleet, we simply must continue to rationalize those stores that don't generate sufficient returns to warrant the investments necessary to provide our customers with a differentiated experience, however really to execute on our strategy as quickly and decisively as we would have liked will continue to be a challenge.","In fiscal 2019, we expect costs associated with preparing for and executing the separation to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.44. As the work evolve, we\u2019ll continue to provide additional information and context.","Excluding the first quarter gain on sale of a building costs associated with preparing and executing the separation, restructuring costs and any tax related impacts as well as the second quarter tax reform adjustments, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75. With regards to gross margin, we now expect full-year gross margin deleverage to be roughly in line with the year-to-date trends. We've had some questions on the guidance revision we provided a few weeks ago. Just to provide some additional context, the fiscal 2019 guidance we gave during our Q2 call in August embedded an inflection in trends particularly at Old Navy and the assumption that we would be entering the fourth quarter with a bit of momentum.","Given we did not see the inflection that we had hoped for materialize, we felt that a reduction to our guidance to better reflect current trends was prudent. Of course, however we're not pleased with our updated outlook, the organization remains focused on execution over the important holiday season and ending with improved momentum heading into 2020.","Now turning to third quarter financial performance. On a reported basis, our earnings per share was $0.37, excluding costs associated with our planned separation, and previously announced specialty fleet restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, $0.01 above our earlier guidance range due to timing capability in the closing process.","Regarding other key metrics, net sales for the quarter were $4 billion down 2% to last year. Comp sales were down 4% compared with flat last year. Rest of the quarter continues to be largely driven by new store openings at Old Navy and Athleta as well as non-comp Janie and Jack sales partially offset by Gap store closures.","As you saw the total sales accounts by division are in our press release. Third quarter gross margin was down 70 basis points to 39% an improvement from first half trends. While gross margin was in line with our expectations, the composition was slightly different, with Gap performing better and Old Navy performing worse than expected.","Merchandise margin was down 50 basis points primarily driven by Old Navy and Banana Republic partially offset by Gap brand and Athleta. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points, primarily driven by lower net sales. Regarding SG&A on a reported basis, third quarter total operating expenses were $1.3 billion. When excluding costs associated with our planned separation and fleet restructuring, SG&A as a percentage of net sales deleveraged 70 basis points again primarily reflecting lower sales as well as increased expenses relating to technology investments.","Moving to taxes and interest, the effective tax rate was 33% in the third quarter, excluding the non-cash tax impacts related to restructuring charges, our adjusted tax rate was about two points lower. We now expect our full-year reported effective tax rate to be about 31%. Excluding current year adjustments to our fiscal year 2017 tax liability for tax reform guidance and certain non-cash tax impacts related to expected restructuring charges, we continue to expect our full-year 2019 effective tax rate to be about 26%. Regarding inventory, we ended the quarter with inventory up 2% compared to last year.","Excluding the impact of the Janie and Jack acquisition, store openings net of store closures and tariffs, inventory was down about 1% in line with previous guidance, as we continue to work around improving our overall inventory productivity.","While we've been more conservative in our inventory buys in the back half, there's more opportunity to better leverage core capabilities to eliminate waste in our buying processes, particularly given the challenging traffic trends.","We're pushing ourselves to buy less up front and keep more open on the back end. Brands are holding more open and over time this will allow us to be more nimble in the way we react to product trends and overall business performance. Also, as we said in September, the work to improve allocations based on Channel demand and localizing our assortment continues which over time is expected to increase yield, gross margin return on inventory and improve our working capital profile. We expect inventory levels to continue to decrease in Q4, while noting that in transit could cause fluctuations in this point in time metric.","Turning to cash flow, year-to-date free cash flow was $5 million, a decrease of $52 million over last year. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in line with our historical target of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $523 million, including approximately $32 million of separation related capital.","We're up to near 2019 capital expenditure guidance to include separation related capital investments needed to facilitate the planned separation. We now expect fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of about $835 million. This is comprised of $575 million of base capital with priorities continuing to be focused and profitable growth opportunities at Old Navy and Athleta and investing prudently in technology and supply chain initiatives that position each of the future companies for sustainable growth, $160 million of separation capital investment primarily related to technology and logistics, and $100 million of expansion costs related to one of our headquarters building and a build-out of our Ohio Distribution Center.","Our overall philosophy around returning cash to shareholders has not changed. In addition to our quarterly dividends, we completed an additional $15 million of share repurchases during the third quarter and we expect to repurchase approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter as well. Year-to-date, we paid dividends of $274 million. Regarding store count, year-to-date, we added 85 Old Navy and Athleta stores on a net basis and acquired 140 Janie and Jack locations.","At Gap brand, we closed 21 stores primarily in North America, net of openings primarily in Asia. We ended the quarter with 3,938 company operated stores. We now expect 15 net store closures for the year as we accelerate the pace of openings in Athleta and completed some opportunistic openings of Gap outlets in China.","Before I open up the call for your questions, many of you already know that Tina Romani, or Head of Investor Relations will be moving on to a new opportunity outside of Gap, Inc. On behalf of the entire team, I want to express our gratitude for everything she has brought to this role, her great technical ability but also her quick laughter and everything she's done for the company over the past seven years, she'll be missed.","I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Katina Metzidakis, whose name I always stumble over, who will be assuming the Head of IR role. Katina has over a decade of experience primarily as a sell side analyst, and more recently in Investor Relations. She joined Gap, Inc. three months ago and working closely with Tina is off to a great start. Please join me in congratulating both of them and please reach out to Katina and the team on any investor communications going forward. So let me close by reiterating Bob's comments. We have a clear view of where our brands need to approve and appropriate clarity and urgency about the path forward. Our conviction on the opportunities remains strong. With that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hello, this is [indiscernible] on for Alex, thanks so much for giving - for taking the time for a question. I was wondering if you could dive into Gap brand a little bit deeper, specifically by channel and geography. Can you help us break down trends between Gap stores and Specialty Gap outlet and then also if you had any impact from some of the disruption in Asia and Hong Kong this quarter?","Teri List-Stoll","Sure, as I said, the Gap brand had some bright spots in the quarter particularly as it pertains to the Denim initiatives that they had stated were going to be a priority for the brand. And so we were quite pleased with the performance of Denim really across channels and geographies. We don't disclose the specific results by channel but I would say that particularly in Specialty, we were pleased with the progress we saw overall.","We did definitely have some disruption in Asia. The Hong Kong situation is a very difficult situation and obviously had an impact on the business in that's part of our China business. And so we saw some challenges there. We also had some softness in Japan, which was a little bit of a product acceptance issue, but also some other macro factors that affected traffic overall in that geography.","So net-net as you look at it, as I said the progress we continue to see against margin rate is exactly what we think is a priority. Seeing the success in Denim when we bring together great product with great marketing and great in-store execution, does give us some optimism as we continue to drive that same formula across more categories and more channels. So still lots of work to do on the brand, but seeing some positive signs.","Unidentified Analyst","Great and if I could just ask one more as a quick follow-up regarding gross margins on your outlook for the fourth quarter, you're comping off of a relatively easy comparison for 4Q 2018. Can you help us understand some of the moving pieces and puts and takes by maybe brand and how you're thinking about the promotional structure with particular eye on how you're thinking about the Old Navy gross margin, given the performance hasn't been quite as good as you had previously thought it would be?","Teri List-Stoll","As I said on a year-to-date basis, most of our gross margin challenge has come from the Old Navy brand, and we've actually had some positive from Gap, particularly in the third quarter. The expectations for those two brands actually came out different than we expected. And so as we move into Q4 and particularly with the revision in guidance we've made, what we've acknowledged is that the trends we have been seeing have not yet inflected. And that's why we provided the guidance that would say Q4 margin is going to be fairly consistent with what we have seen year-to-date and it's the same primary factors driving it, which is largely Old Navy. Again, as we said, it's early days for holiday. So a lot can happen. But that's our current view.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randy Konik","Thanks a lot. I guess Teri just following up on margins, you gave us perspective that the gross margins for Gap had been up, it sounds like for three quarters in a row, which means that Old Navy gross margins has been down. If you look at the annual guidance you've given us, what does that imply for the segment margin of Old Navy on an annual basis for the end of this year? And I guess the question we're all trying to get towards is what would -- what starts to kind of stabilize those operating margins or segment margins in Old Navy and when? That's my first question. Thanks.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, so I think what you can anticipate is that there is meaningful margin degradation in the Old Navy brand on a fiscal year basis at the segment level. And we will likely provide some additional detail with that as we close out the fiscal year. But what will really need to happen in order to address that is for us to see some of the benefits of the actions we've taken with regard to product, particularly the women's product. And then as we continue to buy leaner, we bought quite a bit leaner in the back half of the year as we've talked about, but the traffic drag has done a little bit worse than expected.","So we're still not where we want to be and as we've leaned into Q1 and Q2, we've tried to balance the fact that the product will continue to get better with the changes we've made, but also recognizing that same traffic lag, so I would expect the combination of improved products as we move through Q4 into Q1 as well as the strengthened marketing plans that we put in place and will sustain as we move into Q1 and then the leanness of the inventory should give us a little more margin leverage.","Randy Konik","Helpful and can I just maybe ask a question for Bob, I guess Bob since we don't get you on the call that often, I just want to get your personal perspective or view of what you think the future of the Gap brand should look like or look differently from what was being previously pursued under Art. Just want to get some of your thoughts there and just expand upon what type of quality or different qualities you might be looking for from the new leader going forward? Thanks.","Robert Fisher","Yes, look I'm objective about the performance of the brand and realize that significant improvement is required. There is a lot of transformation work that is going on and will continue with urgency. We really looked at the separation as a catalyst for reimagining the operating models, the process, the culture, our focus is going to be on improving the profitability of the brand. We need more standardized processes, that's better leveraging of our investments in systems and capabilities, adopting a stronger culture of accountability. We're looking at a common operating platform and a more focused investment choices. Those are critical for us.","Regarding the CEO search, we got talented leaders in place who are looking at their businesses and taking the necessary actions. As the Board looks at potential successors, its focus will be on leadership candidates with operational excellence that can drive greater efficiency, speed and profitability in a creative environment. We are a mixture here of left and right brained. And so far as you find that, that's important.","Randy Konik","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks, great. So as we kind of break this down, what would be the outlook for comps by brand in the fourth quarter relative to performance that you saw in the third quarter, and then at Old Navy maybe larger picture, where on the women's side do you see the biggest challenge with the product assortment currently. And what do you think is the timeline to turn that business?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, so we haven't broken down comp by brand as we think about the guidance, we've given for Q4, I think what we have said is that, that we weren't, we weren't thrilled with the Banana performance on the quarter and obviously, some of that was just timing of product flows relative to fall.","So hopefully we will see some positive inflection there. But for Gap and Old Navy, we\u2019re not anticipating a major turn versus what we've seen. With regards to the Old Navy product issues in women's, we've talked about it a bit, it has tended to be a bit of a combination of factors in terms of some of the silhouettes and the prints and patterns that that we just kind of missed and we lost sight of what our consumer really valued, it was a little bit exacerbated by some of the broader trends in the market not being necessarily democratic but and is relative to our own customer needs.","And so and then obviously as we have challenges in women's product that does cast a bit of a shadow over the rest of the business because our primary customer is the mom, the woman and when she comes into the store and doesn't find something that she loves, it obviously affects her willingness to shop, men's and kids, babies. So we've been very much focused on is we have strengths in the business in Denim and Fleece and Active. And so as we lean into those for fall, that does give us a little bit of a bridge as we continue to drive the improvement in women's products.","I think the sense of [indiscernible] come in to that business from Athleta is that we're making real good headway. We understand the issues, and we will continue to see progress there, not saying about what we're seeing has any reflection on our long-term opinion of the strength of the brand, or the growth prospects of the brand, it really is very much product issues, which has led to some traffic pressures. And we're working our way through it.","Matthew Boss","Great, and then just one follow-up on the margin front as we think about expenses, Teri what's the best way to think about Gap versus Old Navy as we think about balancing marketing, wages and investments against some of the outlined efficiency opportunities more as we think beyond this year for the Gap and Old Navy?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, just make sure I'm answering your question. So let me take a shot at it and then tell me if I have hit the mark. But our priority today and our priority even leading up to in post separation will be to ensure that we're allocating sufficient investment to the growth prospects of Old Navy and Athleta. So we're going to make that a priority to ensure they're both stood up for success against their respective strategic priorities.","The Gap brand, we are investing behind the brand, but very thoughtfully, intentionally. So for example in Q4, we will have a little more marketing investments frankly across all of the brands, because it's an important season as you know and to the extent we have had traffic pressures, we need to be able to invest in engaging our customers to drive more frequency to acquire new customers to just ensure we're getting the foot traffic across both stores and in online. So we will be investing in all of the brands but with a definite distortion to fixing Old Navy and continuing to support the growth of Athleta.","Matthew Boss","That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mark Altschwager with Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Teri, maybe just following-up on that last line of discussion. So I meant at Old Navy, it sounds like women's is still an issue. But you do have you're seeing some positive trends in other areas of the assortment that perhaps over index, over holiday if I heard that correctly. And it also sounds like marketing, it's been identified as an opportunity and you are investing more heavily in that marketing in the fourth quarter. So I guess if I have those two things correct, why not more sequential improvement in that comparison in the fourth quarter, I guess the down mid single digit guidance, it seems to presume that trends don't get much better despite the easier comparison. So I'm trying to reconcile all that things?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, no, no, it's a fair question. And maybe it's just while we're leaning into Denim, Fleece and Active, I don't think that that can offset some of the challenges we have in women's partly for the reason I described that is the women's product isn't drawing her in and starting her shopping. It does have impact on the other categories as well. But definitely, particularly even in holiday even though we'll be having, we have Jingle Jammies which is a great promotion for the brand and we have other things going on.","At the end of the day, if we're not strong in dresses and woven and the things that she wants to buy for holiday, that's going to have a bit of an impact. Now, in fairness, we've been working at this and we have seen some positive trends, we've seen over the last few weeks, some positive sales over traffic. There are some indicators that that are been encouraging, as I said but we remain cautiously optimistic given how early it is. And we would like nothing more than to be able to come out of holiday and tell you that we saw the inflection, we had originally been hoping for. We just -- it\u2019s just premature for us to call that today.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you and congrats Tina and Katina. Bob and Teri would love your thoughts on the state of the store base and how you're thinking about the lower productivity Gap stores and what may happen there because we're cautious on traffic trends being under pressure there and the future as well. And also on the broader topic of speed and cyber platforming and your thoughts on changes that can be made to the business, that's been a journey for you in terms of that has been an area of focus, would love your thoughts on what's ahead? Thank you.","Robert Fisher","Yes, I guess given I've been here in the seat two weeks, I'm going to let Teri take that one. But I appreciate you\u2019re asking me.","Teri List-Stoll","And I'm happy to start with and Bob may have something to add, because Bob and I spent some time this morning even talking to one of our landlords about, about the stores and this is, this is an important part of our transformation of really the specialty business, but particularly the specialty business in the Gap brand. And we have acknowledged with our fleet restructuring program, that we still have too many stores that are oversized, not performing the way we need to need them to perform, maybe in locations that are no longer on her path that aren\u2019t driving the profitability that we need.","And so it's critical that we get our store face down to the appropriate number of stores with the appropriate level of profitability is where we actually have the ability to invest in the stores. I mean, Bob can share his experiences over the years but it's clear that a lot of our stores are oversized, a lot of stores haven't been invested in to provide a differentiated experience to our customers.","So we're very, very much focused on getting to the right store base. Now, the flip side is specialty of course is on the outlet side and the factory side for Banana, the value of space is certainly more attractive. It has store economics, not unlike Old Navy with nice margins and lower rod and those in fact have opportunity to certainly perform better but obviously more financially attractive from the get go. And we are continuing to look at how we drive those and could potentially even add stores there over time, as the business turns.","Robert Fisher","You also asked a question about speed. This has been a long, slow journey to speed. And it's not anything that I'm terribly proud of, I think we can do a lot better. And I think we have to look at the entire way we design, develop, sample, source, and distribute product and get into the 21st century.","Teri List-Stoll","This is one where we have invested in a lot of capability. And so what we really need to drive adoption of some of the capabilities that we do have and it does take some intentional planning and operational discipline, you have to platform the fabrics, you have to take some best in some cases, and importantly you have to leave yourself open on inventory to be able to","respond to learnings you have on both demand and trends. And so that is an area we need to continue to exploit because we've already invested in the capabilities.","Oliver Chen","Thank you.","Robert Fisher","Until our turns are better than average, we can do better.","Teri List-Stoll","Next question?","Operator","Certainly, our next question will come from Westcott Rochette with Evercore ISI.","Westcott Rochette","Thanks a lot guys. Going back to Old Navy, you\u2019ve obviously built-up a lot of goodwill with the customer over time as a value fashion oriented. Are you seeing signs that that customer is still seeking you out and looking and just not happy moving on whether it's online as a pre-shop things that are showing that the customer is still looking and you can easily kind of win them back and thinking about that there's a value oriented, off-price retailer to sit at 10% like a parallel comp. Do you think that customer to this kind of migrating to other places right now, but you find that you can pull them back? Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, it's a really fair question. And obviously, the competition in the value space is very strong. We've seen some of our best competitors do very well during this time where we've been challenged with some of our own operational issues. But when we look at the fundamental measures of brand health, we still feel very good about our share levels, the menus share, the brand health that we look at from a YouGov standpoint, which is a measuring service we use, our NPS scores as we look at experiences of customers in our stores.","These are all positive indicators. And so I think to quickly answer your question, we very much do believe that our customers is still engaged, and that as we tailor our promotional activities, our marketing activities and continue to return to delighting her with our product offerings, that the customer engagement will be as strong as it's ever been.","Robert Fisher","There's no question that some of the competition is getting better. But this is still a very highly fragmented industry with fluid shares. And when you have that and you perform, you should be able to grow share.","Westcott Rochette","Excellent. And can you just provide or give an update on what your digital sales are whether the activity in the digital is significantly different than what you're seeing in-store? Thank you very much.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, across the board, our online trends are better than our store trends. And in fact, in our growth trends at Old Navy and Athleta the quarter had double-digit growth in online, Athleta is actually about half online given its heritage and still posting double-digit growth there. So there is a definite spread there. And that's, that's really what we're focused on is how do we create seamless experiences for our customers, so that digital is embedded and seamless for them, so that we can capture them wherever they shop, and wherever they buy, which tend to be not necessarily the same place. And so we were pleased with the progress we're seeing in our online business, but also see that as a continued opportunity for growth as we move forward.","Westcott Rochette","Thank you. Good luck.","Teri List-Stoll","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you so much for taking the question. Bob, I wanted to just get your perspective and Teri yours as well. We're trying to understand from the outside, it's a little more difficult. The what it is about the organization that prevented Gap discretely and separately from Old Navy from focusing on each of their respective customers and having a differentiated strategy because as we understand it from the outside, there's these are completely separate organizations. They have a different staff in each brand. And so we're just trying to figure out what was it about these two businesses being in the same organization that sort of prevented that separate individual focused on each of their customers that you think can be addressed and fixed through the separation?","Robert Fisher","Sure. The fundamental business models are different from between the two, the two businesses between the Gap, Inc. portfolio which sells about 425 million units a year but produces over 35,000 styles. So that's 12,000 units for style. Old Navy is we talked about it here as machine, it\u2019s a units business. It operates on a different scale than the brands in the Gap, Inc. portfolio, it sells 700 million units a year, concentrated in 9,700 styles, that's about 70,000 units of style. It's an $8 billion brand and operates at the intersection of value and specialty. And it's in order to have a specially focus, I think we need to have everything aligned around I'm sorry, in order to have the value focus, we need to have everything aligned around value. And that's not the way the other brands are.","Teri List-Stoll","And Bob maybe I would just add that that there are -- there's friction whenever you have a portfolio and even though the brands are run separately and Sonia very much today is focused on the growth of Old Navy in terms of day to day execution.","When it comes down to capital allocation or even how we might roll-out initiatives that are beneficial to all brands, but for whatever reason, the timing may be influenced by the needs of one brand over another.","There's just a number of places within the portfolio where the friction affects the speed and ability of Old Navy to be able to be singularly focused on both the capital allocation and operational choices that would allow it to win in this highly competitive values.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, that's really helpful. Teri, I just had one quick follow-up for you on the capabilities. When Bob talked about, not proud of the performance on the long, slow journey to speed. You mentioned that you've invested in a number of capabilities, but perhaps they're not being utilized. Could you just remind us what are a couple examples of those capabilities?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, there has been a number of tools that are a function of the overall speed model, whether it's testing or whether it's use of data science and some of our inventory planning. There's just a number of places within our -- what we call our PEES, which is our Product End-to-End System, where we built in capability that hasn't been fully utilized. Some of it also as I said, just planning, it takes a different level of discipline to be able to get the benefit of speed model. And then the last part is co-creation where we have not ramped-up our co-creation capabilities with vendors as much as we have, as we would have expected. We invest in those relationships. We have some very sophisticated vendors, but we haven't fully exploited what they can bring to the party in terms of co-creation, which also can help with speed.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Bob, you've lived with The Gap, Inc. as your whole life and separation has been a topic in the past never obviously is foremost now. And given the current dislocation in the retail market, and in the retail market and what you see for the different brands, how do you look at, do you see any acceleration of timing of them being standalone, and is the timing for the separation still Spring of 2020 or February 2020. And Teri given the changes going on in terms of what you're seeing. Athleta I think there was a little bit of a hiccup in this quarter, anything that we should watch in terms of the people side, given the changes going on that could accelerate or hinder progress as we move through 4Q? Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","Dana, there are lot of questions in there. We will take a shot and then make sure we\u2019ve gotten them off.","Robert Fisher","We did a thorough review of the strategic tenants underlying the separation as well, the operational and execution of plans. We remain confident in the value creation opportunities, it presents inclusive of our current business, current view on business and the expected cost of the transaction. We're looking at mid-year for the transactions, and but we're going to, the planning and the execution of this is complicated and people are working really hard heads down.","Fortunately, much of the work goes on in the more corporate functions. I've been really very pleased that I don't see a tremendous amount of distraction going on in the brands, which are the ones critical to execute holiday and beyond. And yes, it was a -- it was a difficult decision but at some point parents let their children leave the house and go out and do great things. So I think that was the conclusion we can give.","Teri List-Stoll","And Dana, I think you asked about effectively talent retention is that\u2019s the last part of your question?","Dana Telsey","Exactly.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, this is one where, this is a year of change. And it's a year of business challenges and obviously, that that can create more work for everyone in the organization. And so you have some risks. But I do think in many respects, particularly even over the last few weeks, as we work through the leadership transitions, I think there's renewed optimism about our ability to have the clarity of the path forward and make the decisive, take the decisive actions that support that strategy and have a sense of urgency in driving the transformation and setting both companies up for success. So I think that employees are energized by that, and we can already start to feel it in the building today.","Dana Telsey","Thank you, best of luck.","Teri List-Stoll","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference. You may now disconnect."],"10188":["Gap, Inc.

As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participant.","I would now like to introduce your host, Jack Calandra, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations.","Jack Calandra - SVP-Corporate Finance & Investor Relations","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap, Inc.'s Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements as well as reconciliations and descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com.","These forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 25, 2016, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements. Joining me on the call today are CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons. Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks which you can view by going to the Investors section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking to you as we kick off 2016. We've got 2015 behind us and I want to spend a reasonable amount of time going over my inventory of 2015, some of our accomplishments and some places where I feel like we need to continue to accelerate progress.","I've spoken to you about this before and we're on a journey that is going to continue to take time both against our digital priorities as well as our product priorities. And so I want to spend a few minutes speaking to that and then I will focus a little bit on 2016 and where we are.","So when I spoke to you a year ago and frankly each quarter that we've had this conversation, I've reiterated the fact that we have three core priorities in this company. The first one is product, and so we are at our core a fashion apparel company and our customers come to us for great, emotional on-trend, on-brand product. And a lot of the work that we have been doing in 2015 is continuing to move our brands forward to get centered on their aesthetic, centered on the right trends, to restore the appropriate quality to our products and really put in place the products in our stores that we know that our customers love. And I am really pleased with the quality of the work and the quantity of the work and the pace of the work that we've been doing across the entire company against our product priorities.","And I've spoken to you about my vision of how products is changing in this industry. It's fascinating as you look at how the Fashion Week activities have played out over the last couple of weeks, a lot of articles out there about how brands are now making product available on runway immediately to their consumers. We did that in a small way also in Banana Republic. To me, what that illustrates is the increasing clock speed inside of this business, how fast trend at the high end of the market disseminates down into the mass markets. And it's against that backdrop of increasing clock speed, increasing pace of this business that we've been making very significant changes in our product process.","And I'm not going to go into all of those today, but those are changes focused on getting better and better each season at managing buying risk as we build our assortments, an increasingly responsive and short supply chain, using science blended with the arts of creativity, design and merchandising to build the best possible assortments for our brand, and putting in place a very solid commercial planning process that allows us to make sure that we're building a commercial assortment that is on trend, on brand, with the right quality, mapped against delivering and exceeding our budget priorities.","That is not all coming to fruition yet, but I'm, again, pleased with the work that we're doing. There are a couple of key components here that I want to call out. I am a true believer in quality, a big believer in quality and I believe that our customers are very sophisticated when it comes to understanding the value that we offer them in our products. And I'm extremely pleased with the quality restoration that I see in Gap's products and in Banana Republic as we look at the spring assortment and the summer assortment going forward.","Second issue is, I've talked about responsiveness in our supply chain. This is a journey, and again, I'm not going to tell you what yard line we're on or give you a numerical score, but we are making significant and rapid progress, progress that is reflected in platforming product where we're buying fabrics over multi-season buys, positioning that fabric with key strategic vendors, giving us responsive capabilities, in some cases, to leave Open-to-Buy in season so that we can be back into product in season; in essence, buying what's working rather than guessing what's going to work.","The third thing is progress on inventory management. And a big step that we took forward was a couple of years ago where we brought all of our inventory pools across our online and our stores together. We've made further progress this year where we've leveraged our retail DCs to provide direct fulfillment capacity for our online business and we're continuing to take steps to make sure that we're stranding the least amount of inventory and getting every penny of gross margin out of all of our units across the entire business regardless of what store it's in or what channel it was brought to fulfill.","Second priority is experience. And on experience, I will call out a number of things that we're doing. We're modernizing our POS. I've talked about that before. We've built a number of omnichannel capabilities. We've virtualized our inventory so that we have access to all of our inventory across all of our demand. The thing that I am really excited about is the accelerating pace of mobile and the mobile experience that we have. Historically, we've operated our websites in two separate platforms. We're in the process of bringing those together on a fully responsively designed website. And most importantly, we're going through a cultural change inside the company of really thinking digital first and mobile first.","Historically in this business, the moment of truth was when a customer crossed the leased line into a store. Today, as a company, we are increasingly seeing the moment of truth is when a customer, through their phone, comes into our digital store and we either win or lose their affection, their engagement and ultimately their sales if we win or lose at that moment of truth.","And that creates for us both an opportunity, but also an imperative to move as fast as the customer is moving in mobile. This year, the bulk of our traffic will be mobile traffic to our digital space. That represents an opportunity because a great majority of that traffic is incremental, but it also means that we offer the customer an emotional, immersive, holistic, engaging brand experience along with what we have historically done extremely well, which is a very efficient e-commerce transactional experience.","The last priority is talent and the entire company sits on a foundation of talent. We've been able to attract and retain exceptional talent and I am committed to making sure that this company has the best talent in the industry lined up in our businesses and our functions.","As you all know yet, I've not named a permanent head of our Old Navy brand. When you have a seat like that that is empty which is one of the biggest seats in the business, I want to take my time to make sure that I understand looking forward what's the right profile of leadership for that seat and to understand our talent inside and outside the company in a way where I can make a decision that I feel is the best decision for the brand and the company.","Part of what I've spent my time on over the last few months is getting very deep into the Old Navy business, and I'll speak more about that in a moment, to really understand where are the growth opportunities, which are significant, but where are those growth opportunities inside of Old Navy and how do we map a leadership role against the pursuit of those growth opportunities.","I knew Old Navy pretty well several months ago. I've been much deeper with the team over there over the last few months. And what I will honestly and directly say to you is, as much as I was bullish about the opportunity in front of Old Navy before, for long-term continuous growth, I'm even that much more bullish today. I see a great brand and a compelling value proposition that I believe has the potential to hunt around the world. And I'm super excited about the growth prospects in front of that business.","So let's dive in, in a little bit more into each of the brands and just talk a little bit about my observations of 2015. So just to be clear, and I'll start with Old Navy since I was talking about Old Navy; four years of growth. That is a business that has demonstrated that the brand is strong and that the value proposition for masspirational fashion, on trend, appropriate to the brand with great quality that she perceives and understands for the entire family, that's a compelling value proposition.","We hit a bump in the road in Q4 and let me be clear about this. What happened in Q4, we have diagnosed and it was a combination of factors that unfortunately came together. First was we had a couple of style misses. We had a little bit of excess clearance inventory that we carried through. We had an unexpected drop of traffic, which has now for the most part corrected itself. The team is on it. I know we're making the right changes and I expect Old Navy to get back on track and continue to deliver the kind of market share leading performance that we've seen now over the course of the last four years.","Let me go to Banana for a moment. I knew it was going to be a rebuilding year from a product and aesthetic standpoint. We took Banana to a place where we were trying to lead on fashion and trend and she does not want Banana to be that. We've diagnosed it, we've fixed it. I've seen the spring product, I've seen the summer product, but we got behind it in 2015 and I'm disappointed with the performance. But here's again what I'm confident about in Banana, which is, we've been doing the right work, I feel we have a very strong team in place right now, we have centered on the classic, appropriate, expected aesthetics of the brand. And I feel much more comfortable that we are on track as we get into spring, summer and then fall this year.","So moving quickly to Athleta. We delivered a very strong back half performance in Athleta. We have a business that is very well positioned for our customer. It is right in the sweet spot of lifestyle trend. It is fundamentally omni-channel in that it came from being a catalog and online business with now over 100 stores in the portfolio and I continue to be very bullish about the upside of that business and the growth potential. Just as a sidebar, I would point out that I've been very supportive in them continuing to look for incremental growth opportunities on top of that solid platform.","And a few weeks ago, we announced that we are building out an assortment for all the way from a very young girl up to a teenager inside of the Athleta box. We're not putting incremental real estate behind that. Rather, we're putting it in our existing stores and we feel that is a significant opportunity. So, a great business, one I'm super happy to have in our portfolio and I expect that you will continue to hear more news about Athleta going forward.","Okay. Last, let me finish as I talk about our brands with Gap brand. And I was kind of starting and ending with Gap brand when we started speaking a year ago. I knew we had a rebuilding year in front of us. It started with new leadership, a new team around that leadership. It worked to get the brand centered back on its casual, optimistic, American aesthetic, and then rebalancing the assortment to assert our rightful share in key categories where Gap has always played. So, the last couple of weeks I've been in stores, I'm always in stores at the beginning of a big seasonal flow with a cross-functional team after our customers have had an opportunity to engage our products.","First thing I would highlight is a renewed energy in our stores. It is partly a function of our field team, which is world-class. It is partly a function of the fact that we have product in the stores that lights the stores up. It's optimistic, it's colorful, it's feminine for the women, it's masculine for the men, it's got the right level of sophistication for Gap as a brand and it is much more centered in what the appropriate aesthetic is for the brand. So I see the aesthetic coming through very strong casual, optimistic American.","Second thing I see, across key categories, a knits complex that is fully developed to take advantage of share of wallet in knits. We have silhouettes and fabrication that cover a wide range of uses, we have color, we have print, we have pattern, we have neutrals, we have great quality in those knits and I see strong progress forward just by asserting our right to actually play as we should be playing in knits.","Third, denim, core category of Gap. It's what the spring campaign has been focused on. Silhouettes, fabrications, wash and novelty, all right in the sweet spot of where denim trend is right now and I'm really optimistic about what I see coming in the denim business across all of our brands, but particularly in Gap brand.","And so, again, I could go on and on about this. I could talk about our woven shirts programs, I could talk about intentional outerwear development, but I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that the team has made against their diagnosis a year ago on what needed to happen and how the product now shows up in the stores in front of our customers.","One of the things I want to reiterate and just make sure everybody hears it and I'll say this again every time we talk is, I have strong conviction about the long-term growth prospects of this company and the work that we are doing to reestablish our dominance in key categories in our businesses, to reassert appropriate aesthetic expression of our brands, the continued growth across all of our channels and the broad-based geographic growth that we've put a structure in place to achieve. I am committed to that and we will continue to move down that path.","Why I spend so much time talking about product is product is the foundation for gaining market share. And so I want to emphasize the fact that our commitment for growth is not just a commitment of building new stores and new geographies, of taking new channels to new places. It's also about moving these brands back to a place where they can gain market share in our core markets.","So 2015, a year of rebuilding, a year of focusing on getting our product back on track, reestablishing the path for a couple of our key brands. I'm confident in Old Navy, a bump in the road, but I'm confident in the value proposition and what that brand means to our consumers. What I can assure you is my team and I have a great deal of urgency. I know what this company is capable of at our best. I know what these brands are capable of at their best. And I and my team are focused on not just achieving that for a moment, but achieving that with consistency.","I'm looking forward to this coming year, I'm looking forward to seeing these brands start to perform to their potential and I want to thank you for your support.","Now I'll turn it over to Sabrina.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth quarter and full year results before turning to our outlook for 2016.","It's important to note that our reported results include pre-tax costs related to our previously announced strategic actions totaling $25 million for the quarter and $132 million for the year. That is at the low end of our guidance range of $130 million to $140 million. $98 million of the total full-year charge is operating expense and the remainder hits gross margin.","Now, starting with sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.4 billion. Comp sales were down 7%. For the full year, comp sales were down 4%. On a reported basis, 2015 net sales were $15.8 billion. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales would have totaled $16.2 billion, down 2%.","Moving to gross margins. Fourth quarter gross profit totaled $1.4 billion and gross margin contracted 240 basis points to 32.8%. Merchandise margin was down 140 basis points as reported, but down only 80 basis points excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points.","For the full year, gross profit was $5.7 billion and gross margin was down 210 basis points to 36.2%. Merchandise margin was down 130 basis points as reported, but down only 60 basis points excluding the impact of our strategic actions and foreign exchange. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 80 basis points.","Regarding SG&A, for the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion. Marketing expenses totaled $169 million, $9 million below last year. For the full year, marketing expenses declined $61 million to $578 million. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion, about flat to last year.","Turning to earnings, on a reported basis, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.53 and full year EPS totaled $2.23. Excluding the impact of our strategic actions, adjusted EPS was $0.57 for the quarter and $2.43 for the year. Additionally, it's important to remember that FX negatively impacted full-year EPS by an estimated $0.14 or about five percentage points of growth.","Regarding stores and capital expenditures, on a net basis, we closed five stores in 2015 and our square footage remained about flat. This includes about 150 Gap specialty store closures, broadly in line with our guidance. Store counts and square footage are listed in our press release.","Capital expenditures totaled $726 million, which was below our guidance as we prudently reacted to the tougher business performance. Regarding balance sheet and cash flow, as a testament to the cash-generating power of our business, in an otherwise difficult year, free cash flow totaled about $870 million. Consistent with our commitment to distributing excess cash, we paid $377 million in dividends and returned $1 billion through repurchases during the year. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash and our ending share count was 397 million shares.","Inventory dollars per store were about flat at the end of the fourth quarter, in line with our previous guidance and total inventory was down 1%. And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2016.","We expect earnings per share to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.25 and operating margin to be about 9.5%. Embedded in our full-year guidance is a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $120 million in EBIT, which equates to about $0.19 of EPS or eight percentage points of EPS growth off of 2015's $2.43.","Let me say more about foreign exchange given its significance. Our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan, with combined sales in these two countries of about $2 billion. 2016 will be the fourth consecutive year with meaningful headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar. Note that our hedges help to delay, but not eliminate the impact of depreciating foreign currencies. To paint the picture of how dramatically currency movements have impacted our results in recent years, I'd like to offer a few metrics.","The cumulative impact of weaker foreign currencies to our reported sales results was more than $700 million over the past three years. Absent these headwinds, 2015 net sales would have totaled $16.5 billion, up about $900 million since 2012. The impact to the bottom line is also meaningful. We estimate that the impact to EPS has been about $0.40 since 2012.","Here are some additional 2016 guidance metrics. We expect to add 40 net new stores with square footage to remain about flat. In line with our strategy, openings will be focused on China, Outlet and Athleta, while closures will continue to be weighted toward Gap brand. We are reducing capital spending in 2016 to support improvement in return on invested capital. We expect capital expenditures to be about $650 million with a continued focus on mobile and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $560 million. Given our comp includes both store and online sales, we decided to guide to total inventory in 2016. We expect total inventory to be down in the low single digits at the end of the first quarter.","Regarding expenses, it's important to note that SG&A may deleverage against our 2015 reported levels as we potentially restore some categories of expense, such as incentive-based comp. And lastly, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be about 38%.","Finally, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. As a reminder, our $400 million term loan matures in 2016. We currently intend to allocate a portion of our cash flow to repay this. Therefore, 2016 repurchases will likely be meaningfully lower than our historic average.","In conclusion, 2015 was a challenging year for us and others in our sector. Despite our disappointing performance, it's important to highlight some of our strengths as we enter 2016. First, we believe that our size and portfolio of brands are a competitive advantage in areas such as sourcing, real estate and e-commerce; second, as our track record has demonstrated, we of course plan to maintain our operating discipline; and finally, our reliable cash generation and strong balance sheet allow us to make investments in areas like technology and supply chain needed to win in this evolving retail landscape over the long-term.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack.","Jack Calandra - SVP-Corporate Finance & Investor Relations","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. So I guess my first question, as you think about your 2016 game plan and the sense of urgency that you spoke to, does the guidance embed positive comps at all three concepts for the year? And then just along those lines, how should we think about same-store sales opportunity in the front-half versus the second half? Just any color around your expectation and the drivers associated with would be really helpful.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Matthew. I'll start and then if Art has anything to add, he can chime in of course. What I'll tell you is our guidance range always includes a range of scenarios, obviously. We prefer \u2013 it's our goal to try and return to positive comps this year, so we prefer to drive to our range with positive comps. But it doesn't necessarily require a positive comp to get to our guidance. So, again, it's a primary goal of ours to try and drive revenue growth and positive comps but not necessarily required to meet our range.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the only other thing I'll add to that, Matthew, is what I've said now repeatedly, which is I have a strong bias along with my Presidents and Sabrina to make sure that we are tight on inventory, because obviously we've been very promotional. We don't want to be as promotional and a step in that direction is to make sure we're buying tight and then ideally where we can, is to use our inventory responsive capabilities to chase upside if there is upside.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And on your comment around the potential for deleverage this year, what is the fixed cost hurdle? And can you lever on a negative comp as it relates to the SG&A that you were speaking to that you said may de-lever?","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, what I'm suggesting is that if we are meeting all of our goals this year, there's especially two categories which there may be reinvestment in. As you can imagine, coming off of the 2015 year we came off of, incentive comp\/bonus was absolutely minimal. We also reported that marketing expenses were down over $60 million year-over-year. So those, for example, are two categories that if we're tracking well to our goals and doing as we hope to do, we would be happy to see reinvestment in, and that may cause some deleverage of expense.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participant. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much, guys, and I guess a question following on the comments you made about Old Navy, that the fourth quarter ended on a down note with traffic, but the traffic was back. Could you talk about traffic for each division since Christmas or since the start of the quarter?","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, at a high-level, Richard, I'll tell you that Banana has actually had the strongest traffic. So consistently, throughout the year and through the fourth quarter, they've had the strongest traffic, which is good news that when the product comes back as we're looking to it to start to come back this month, we're at least getting the footsteps in the door. Gap has had the weakest traffic on the other hand, so the whole year Gap has had the toughest traffic.","Now, Old Navy for most of the year had pretty solid traffic, slightly negative, but certainly beating our read of mall traffic. The surprise at Old Navy really came in the month of November and December where it fell off significantly. It did return in January. We're not getting overly excited about that because January is a clearance month, so it's really important to see how we do on traffic in the first quarter. But, again, Banana was the strongest, Gap was the weakest, Old Navy's was pretty good up until November and December.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And on top of that, one of the most important metrics I look at is what is our sales over traffic spread. And so, that was what was really good. And also what makes me feel good about Old Navy, even though there was a bump in the road, which is for a long time they have had a very attractive sales over traffic spread, which to me really signifies the health of the brand.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","We will go next to Anne-Charlotte Windal with Bernstein.","Anne-Charlotte Windal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. A question for you, Art, on the competitive landscape and in particular obviously like Primark entered the U.S. market last year. So I'm sure it's something you're tracking very closely. So what type of impact have you seen from their first store opening, so both at KING OF PRUSSIA and in Boston where I think you have a Gap factory store across the street from Primark. Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, something that's absolutely on our landscape. I and my teams are always making sure that we're watching all the competition and certainly a new entrant like Primark, which has had track record of their success and growth very consistently, obviously, that they've had in Europe. I was with the team. In fact, Jack was there with me in the Downtown Crossing store shortly after it opened. We've been looking at it very carefully in the KING OF PRUSSIA store as well and we have our eyes really on it.","Probably, the one thing I'll call out is overall two stores in a very large market haven't had a noticeable impact yes. And so if I look across our whole business, too early to call that at the end of the day. Downtown Crossing specifically where you note that we do have a Gap factory store business has remained strong in that store. Traffic is strong in that area. Big grand opening, in fact, with Primark opening as well, but it's very early days and we're on it, we're watching it.","My issue there, always with a new competitor, particularly one like Primark, it does come in with very sharp price points with an everyday low pricing policy. Very intrigued to see how the American consumer responds to that against the backdrop of how the whole sector typically prices, which is obviously more promotional pricing. So early days, watching it carefully.","Anne-Charlotte Windal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. Sabrina, you cut a significant amount of costs out of the fourth quarter and I was just curious how you're thinking about the sustainability of that. If things don't track towards positive comps, are there more cuts that you could make to stay within your guidance range in 2016?","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, we have proven year-over-year, Lorraine, that we're very disciplined about our expenses. Partially our structure helps us, right? So we've talked about the fact that over half of our expense base is related to our stores and over half of that is variable to sales. So when we have sales come down as they did in the fourth quarter, we get some natural variability and expenses come down as well. I mentioned in my previous response as well as in my prepared remarks that we obviously paid minimal bonus in 2015, so that was a portion in the fourth quarter as well as throughout the year, but probably especially in the fourth quarter of how we brought down the expenses and then finally marketing as well.","So that is actually the very reason why I'm signaling that there may be some deleverage in 2016 as we hopefully are meeting our goals for the year. That said, we're going to continue to manage our expenses very, very tightly, so you can count on us from an absolute perspective to manage them quite tightly, and I think we've proven that we're petty adept at using the levers depending on how business is performing to bring those in line.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Sorry about that. Can you hear me?","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Operator","We can hear you.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey, guys. Sorry. So it's small, Sabrina, but just the other U.S. revenues were down. Is that residual Piperlime anniversarying? And maybe anything you guys can share on just the expected Athleta sales growth and trajectory there? Maybe ultimate store fleet size? Thanks.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, no, thank you for asking that question. Yes, the other is mostly made up of Piperlime, which of course we closed in the first quarter of last year, Athleta and INTERMIX. And so, yes, it looks down driven by Piperlime. If you exclude Piperlime, we're actually up a low-double-digit in revenue growth there.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then just given the commentary around the debt pay downs, any color on expected interest expense for the year?","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's pretty easy to calc. We have the bond outstanding and you guys know that's at a 5.95% interest rate. And then the term loans at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. So it won't fluctuate that much.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. All right. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the year.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And we will go next to Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks. Two quick things, one just on the style misses at Old Navy for Art, you seem comfortable that that's behind the brand. So just wanted to make sure on that. And then for Sabrina, on the strategic actions, the costs, I know you broke it down between OpEx and gross margin for the year. Just wondering how the $25 million in the fourth quarter breaks down?","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, let me take on the style misses, and so to answer your question, am I comfortable that style misses are behind us? No. We're always going to have some style misses, obviously. Design's job is to push creatively and merchandising's job is to counterbalance that with a commercial orientation. We all across our brands and frankly across the industry, one of the bigger style misses of last year was tops went to a silhouette that was a little bit shorter and a little boxier and many women voted that it wasn't very feminine and wasn't very flattering, and it was a style that was out there, but it was a style that frankly didn't really register with a lot of customers and that's a good learning. The word femininity is one that continues to be one that I'm pushing to the front, whether it's across tops or bottoms. Probably a bigger issue.","And then there was a little bit of an issue where we got little bit over-assorted. We got pretty enthusiastic about some sweater styles where there was duplicative choice. And it meant that she came in and she bought \u2013 it was an or versus an and. And, again, I'm confident that as Sabrina and I have leaned in with the team and learned about the business and looked at how we bought it in February and March and April, obviously, looking at that and making sure we're re-registering where we need to be from a style count and a trend standpoint. We're always going to have some misses. I mean the whole point of the work we're doing is to minimize the misses, and as I keep saying, guess less, guess better and fix faster. Sabrina?","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, and then, Dorothy, on your question. In the quarter we had $25 million from the strategic actions. $19 million of that was operating expense and $6 million of that was in gross margin. And just to be helpful I'll say again, that full year was $132 million, $98 million was expense and $34 million was gross margin.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Great. Thanks.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","And we will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. Art, you spent a lot of time talking about product initiatives at the beginning of the call. And you sound fairly confident that the various divisions are on the right track for 2016. I'm just wondering, is there some evidence you can put around that? We're just trying to figure out what is it that gives you confidence that the adjustments that are being made at the brand level will resonate with customers and generate the sales growth you're looking for? Thanks so much.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's a lot of things and I continue to ask myself this as well, which is because I'm very impatient on marching against the metrics that I know we need to do. So let me just highlight a bunch of things and, again, I'm not going to go through specific quantitative analysis here. But several of the things that I feel very confident will register with our consumers as they start to fold back into the assortment. So we just had huge quality misses. Literally places where whether it was fits or the quality of the fabrication, it made the product very difficult to wear. I think I've cited this before but blazers in Banana Republic women's assortment where it was extremely difficult for the average woman to actually get her arm into the armhole. So if you just take those out and you get back to common sense quality that our customers expect, that is going to register with our customers.","A second place, places where we intentionally underdeveloped the product because of either we assumed it wasn't trending or it was the preference of an individual in a seat or whatever. An example of that is knits in women's knits in Gap brand where we underdeveloped last year, we left market share on the table and this year we have very intentional development across fabrications and silhouettes that we believe play in the relevant wear categories and wear occasions for us.","And that's another place where I call it sort of reasserting development to get our fair share of market share. And I've been in the stores now and looked at that and I encourage you to do that. You can see where we actually have a significant knits complex built out. Accessories would be the same. There's a spectacular cinch ballet flat. I think it's in 10 colors it's now in the stores and we do business all day long with that and it wasn't in the stores a year ago and so those are places where again question why we did it, but we've gone back in and said our fair share, we play here, this is where the brand plays.","And then the last thing is the more complicated question is around our responsive capabilities. And so again that is a journey right now. But we have in our twill programs in the spring as an example, and I've talked about this before, the ability to be much faster in the product that is selling on our shelves through a combination of owning the fabric, having the fabric positioned approximate to vendors who have the capacity reserved to cut and sew into it. And ideally those vendors, particularly for North America and the Caribbean basin so that we can cut, sew, wash and dye, put it on a boat and have it back in our stores very quickly.","All those things to me are kind of obvious that they will give us upside. So the only issue on my mind right now is will these things work and impact? It's just the pace and the timing. Sabrina noted in Gap brand that our traffic has been toughest there frankly in my mind because we've been off-brand for longest there. So the pace and the timing of when the customer comes back, discovers the product, embraces it, tweets about it, posts it on Instagram and Pinterest that's really the unknown right now, but I'm very optimistic.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I think either Art or Sabrina, I think it was about 175 Gap stores that you guys outlined at your last Analyst Day for closure and I think you did most of those. When you're looking at the fleet right now, if we were to look, you gave us your guidance for footage this year, but if you look three years out, how does that look? Are there fewer stores? Are there similar amount but much smaller boxes? I'm just kind of curious how you think about the business over the next couple years.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And I would say right now we feel comfortable with the fleet size. We feel like that sweet spot where we are is a good number. We work it continuously and we're always looking at opportunities to either put a store in place like the Time Square that we announced where there'll be a Gap and an Old Navy going into Times Square. Or a store if it's not delivering or we feel like the real estate is not appropriate for the brand, we will get out of that real estate. But at the moment I'm not ready to call a number different than where we are as we look forward.","Second thing, I wouldn't really focus on and I've talked about this is I'm a strong believer in the fact that we can do more business in less real estate in the same location and that is what we're focused on. Obviously you can't flip the fleet overnight into smaller stores, but every opportunity we have, whether it's a lease coming up or a reposition or an opportunity to give some space back and densify, we're going to be taking aggressively advantage of those opportunities. And Gap's got the biggest opportunity there in my view. We tried a store in China. I was in that store a couple weeks ago and super pleased by what I saw. It was a very small store footprint with a full expression of Gap brand and most importantly it worked for the consumer.","And so the early days of really thinking aggressively about densifying through fixtures, through folding versus hanging, through how we use the total cube of the store, aisle width, all those kinds of things, I'm very encouraged by the opportunity there. But, again, that's not an overnight flip.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Hi, thank you. Art, regarding responsive supply chain, is there an axis we should think about it with respect to store banners, in terms of being \u2013 more opportunity to certain banners? And then also the dimension of product category? And as you improve product, I just wanted to get briefed on how you'll sequence in marketing as you have more conviction that product is improving. And just lastly, Sabrina, on the guidance, is our merch margins assumed to be flattish? That would just be helpful. Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, if I think about responsive, and again responsive is a whole bunch of stuff bundled together. But let's just basically talk about one of the things that cuts out many weeks, which is making a multi-season commitment to a fabric, and then having that fabric prepositioned to cut, wash, dye and sew into. That is most powerful as a capability in cotton fabrications. And so that applies to denim, to twill, to knits, et cetera, really consistently across all the brands.","If you start getting into synthetics and then obviously wool, silk and those types of things, it's less an issue there because you just can't necessarily platform those fabrics, although you can some of them, not all of them. Importantly, you can also platform yarns for sweaters at the end of the day. So if I think about the least relevant categories, probably accessories, or outerwear. Most relevant would be our core cotton fabrications which we have that are an important part of the business across all of our brands in denim and twill, in knits and fleece, et cetera.","So, we wouldn't be pushing on something here if it wasn't meaningful for the entire business. Importantly, it's actually also meaningful for Athleta in wearing (46:52) performance fabrics as well. So, this is something that's largely applicable to the total company.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and then with regard to merch margins, Oliver, we don't explicitly guide to merch margin, only the operating margin which I gave you. But to be helpful, there is sort of headwinds and tailwinds. So, the tailwinds in merch margin are clearly going to be the fact that we worked really hard for 12 months to put out new assortments this year where we are hopeful that the customer votes in favor of higher product acceptance. Also on the margin I would say, although I don't want to make it any kind of big headline, but on the margin there is certainly some average unit cost tailwind. So, those are the two tailwinds.","On the flipside you have foreign exchange, which we've guided is actually growing in 2016. And remember in 2015, it hurt our merchandise margins by 50 basis points, and it's bound to be even bigger in 2016. So underlying basis of course we are hoping to get some merch margin expansion, but you kind of have to weigh that against the headwind of foreign exchange.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Okay, great. Both of those frameworks really help. Thank you very much.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the profitability of China in 2015, what you expect for 2016, and just how you expect that business to grow over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll start and then Art can, I'm sure, talk about it as well. So I think we said a few months back publicly that we expected Gap China to be profitable on a management basis in 2015. And in fact, we achieved that goal. So, we are very pleased with that. We would expect, of course, Gap China to continue to improve its profitability year-over-year as time goes on. So, that's Gap China.","If you look at China as a whole, of course, we launched Old Navy recently and as you can imagine, just starting a new brand, that one is not profitable yet. And these things, especially in China, take a few years. But the good news is Gap China met its big milestone of profitability this year, and we expect that to continue going forward.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me talk about Old Navy and just underline that there. So, we opened a handful of stores, and I guess in my mind the sequence here \u2013 the responsible sequence, is open some stores across some relatively heterogeneous real estate, and then start getting the four-wall model correct. And that's what we have been working on right now. I am really, really big on making sure that we understand the best four-wall model, what kind of sites that's located in, whether it's a lifestyle center, or a street front store, or a value center or whatever, and also the store size. And then once we are comfortable with that, put the hammer down on opening real estate after we've got the four-wall model done.","And with Old Navy, I'm not worried about real estate availability. When that business hunts, it hunts in a big way. And it also is a big traffic draw, and so there's a lot of landlord interest out there. So, the pace to me right now is going to be set by making sure that we've really got the four-wall model correctly, but again as I said before, I'm very bullish on that value proposition around the world.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","And we will go next to Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Chen - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hello. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering, Art, if you can talk a little bit about your initial thoughts having seen the Gap spring product inside the stores, and how it's returned to its heritage. And what are some of the goal posts that you're looking for in order to feel more comfortable investing marketing dollars behind the brand? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. Yeah, again as I said, you can imagine I don't have very long fingernails right now. As the spring product has gotten into the stores and I've been out in the stores a lot. And I've been out in stores a lot on an unannounced basis because I want to see what our customers are seeing versus what's been prepped for a CEO visit, and I went into the \u2013 I'll just call one store out right now, went into the store that we have, flagship store on 54th and 5th last week in New York. The product was fully expressed there, spring. We flipped that store. We brought women's down from the second floor down to the first and I walked in and I have to honestly say I'm not sure I've ever felt like that store showed up better as an expression of Gap brand.","The color was evident, the femininity was clear. We had strong ownership and it's clear why we're in the business from the standpoint of women's bottoms, whether it's twill, denim, or bistretch bottoms. The accessory statement was very powerful. And so if I think about a from-to of last year, neutral color palette, unfeminine silhouettes, some quality issues in our business, lots of overlapping denim development, et cetera, I feel like the from-to is optimistic print pattern and color, feminine silhouettes, intentional denim development, ownership in the bottoms business, great accessories business. And so, it's a big step in the right direction.","The most important metric I look at and I'm not going to go into the detail of this is as we're obviously working our way through product from last year clearance product, et cetera, I want to look at the new product that's current season code and understand how we bought it and then what kind of comp we're running off of it. And those are the most important early leading-edge indicators of whether we're seeing good customer acceptance of the product so that's what I'm looking at right now. And then it'll eventually aggregate obviously, if we're seeing good customer acceptance, we're overselling our buy plan that will aggregate the comp.","Betty Chen - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","We will go next to Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking our question. We had a question on athletic performance by brand. Hoping, Art, you could talk about Athleta performance during the quarter and also Old Navy, where we think it's been a little bit softer as of late. And we've seen additional promotions there. And with 15 new store openings at Athleta for 2016, I think that's reined in a little bit from historic levels. How do you think about this size of the footprint going forward? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was a lot of questions embedded in one. You did that artfully. Let me comment on Athleta first. Athleta had and I think we mentioned this and I'll just underline it, a very strong back half and I was really pleased with that. The assortment was in line. They were on trend. The product was well bought and I was really pleased with the numbers. If you look at Old Navy because you raised that specifically, we have had excellent performance out of the full family expression of activewear inside of Old Navy. We had been a little bit more promotional so you are correct on that. But that does not signal anything other than we still have excellent performance out of that business and we're seeing very strong growth.","I'm really encouraged, frankly, across the whole company as I look at it right now because if you take Athleta, Old Navy is full family active expression, add to it a young girl to tween expression inside of Athleta and then a full family expression inside of Gap. We are present and accounted for in the mainstream of what is probably the most important ready-to-wear trend that we've seen since skinny denim maybe came on the scene. And so I feel like we're a very well represented there. We have great fabrics, great development and, as a company, we can share assets across the company, across fabric platform and things like that. So it's a powerful place for us to be.","If I specifically look at Athleta's growth rates, and again, I've said this before, we are learning every day what the right mix of online catalog and stores is in the Athleta business. It's the opposite of what has happened in mainstream retail where people have gone online from a stores business, where in Athleta we've gone into stores from an online and catalog business.","And, our initial expectation as we started to open stores was that it would probably be cannibalizing of our online business. And as we've learned and seen how the store channel and the direct channel interact with each other, we are really pleased to see that the direct business continues to grow even as we open stores, and that as she discovers it in a store, she goes to direct et cetera. So I can't tell you I know what the right fleet size is right now. What I can tell you is that if I can grow this business in a highly accretive way without putting additional CapEx and the fixed expenses of our operating stores into the ground, and continue to see that growth happen to our existing stores and the online channel, that's a very attractive thing to do.","So, we are taking it slow and easy right now as we continue to explore the channel dynamics. But I am in no way signaling the fact that we have nothing but anything but very strong growth expectations out of that business.","Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just first, on the role of outlet online, I know you've kind of shifted the presence and really developed full-fledged sites. So, I guess, how should we think about the positioning relative to some of your full-priced sites and whether you're intending to see some cannibalization going forward? And then second, Sabrina, it sounds like a number of other chains are able to renegotiate leases with some of the REITs. I know you guys have been very tight with your ROD, but how should we think about ROD for this year? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me pick the outlet question up here. We've gone slow into this space. Frankly the reason we've gone there is that's where the customer is, and we've got to go where the customer is right now. The whole outlet business has continued to morph over the last decade. It used to be a business that was highly physically isolated relative to the specialty business, and obviously there's been a collision going on where outlets get closer to specialty, and the suburbs have spread out to where the outlet malls were built.","And the online channel is another extension of that at the end of the day. That's where our customer is, and we felt a need to have a presence there. It's early days right now, we are in our early days of having this channel. It's very difficult to identify anything that is cannibalizing anything frankly, versus the fact that it is complementary to the existing outlet channel. But we are watching it very carefully, and we are trying to understand how it interacts number one, with our outlet stores, because that's critical, but then number two, with the specialty business as well. What I will say is when all the businesses are healthy, the channel distinctions, the price distinctions, et cetera, are very clear to the consumer. But we are watching it very carefully.","Sabrina L. Simmons - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, with regard to ROD, I would say, look the team is very focused on OEs aggressively negotiating the best deals we can, especially given the size of our fleet, and the size of our brand portfolio. What is happening, and has been happening for the last few years in ROD. We've gotten most of the unproductive stores behind us, right? And when we were closing and downsizing a lot of the unproductive square footage, we were able to leverage very easily, even on negative comps on some years, but that is all behind us now. What is happening now is the international stores actually are a big headwind because as a percent to sales, they are a higher percent to sales. Now within their country, every year we are trying to get them to leverage. But from a mix perspective, they hurt the overall ROD profile. So, where we sit today is it takes sort of a low single-digit comp to leverage ROD.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great.

As I mentioned, we will be using slides to supplement our remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors sections at gapinc.com. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Art Peck","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to report Gap Inc.\u2019s sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp. Of course, we still have work to do as we always will, and we did face some challenges during the quarter. But before I get into that, I want to reiterate our commitments as I will over and over again to our balanced growth strategy.","We\u2019re focused on growth in the active and value space. We continue to responsibly rationalize our store foot in specialty real estate. We are investing in our online and mobile channels, a business for us that is $3 billion and growing. We're enhancing our productivity across the enterprise, and we\u2019ll beginning to unlock the value of our customer data assets across brand and across channel. We\u2019re well positioned on our unique and intrinsic strengths as a company, our scale, our platform and of course, our iconic brands.","Looking at the quarter, let\u2019s first turn to Gap brand. We discussed in March that we expected Gap brand to see some pressure in the first half, largely due to the carryover of operational missteps that we have talked to you about before from the last fiscal year. Teri will take you through the specifics in a moment, but I remain confident in the year and confident in the brand. We saw the problem, we took action. The performance of our other brands has met or exceeded our expectations despite cold weather.","Old Navy had another quarter of broad-based strength with two-year stack of 11. Nearly all categories accounts positively and they continued in the first quarter of this year. We did see a slight drag due to weather. That said, it's important to know we saw dramatic improvement in trends when the weather turned late in April, and we\u2019ve seen this continue into the second quarter. For Old Navy, we saw growth in nearly all categories with Denim having the biggest quarter comp in the brand\u2019s history. We opened nine stores and are on track to reach our goal of over 60 Old Navy stores this year. And we\u2019re seeing very positive customer response to over 40 remodels that we\u2019ve done in the Old Navy fleet.","Turning to Banana, and I would like you to turn to Banana. We are very encouraged by the momentum of the business and the brand's performance. Under Mark\u2019s leadership, the brand has been leaning into the development of cleaner, better edited assortments that have a clear brand appropriate point of view. We\u2019re seeing favorable customer response to innovation and favorable customer response to fashion. Banana has also been investing in quality yarns and fabrics without increasing materially the AUC of the product through our strategic sourcing and productivity initiatives. We\u2019ve continued to see strength in sweaters, in bottoms and other loyalty categories, as well as significant lift in dresses during the quarter.","We\u2019re pleased with the progress at Banana and the team remains focused on driving momentum and consistency in the brand, and we believe that this has upside in our portfolio. At Athleta, I hope I say this and we\u2019ll continue to say this. We saw another strong quarter with double-digit growth. And I believe that this gem in our portfolio, which is becoming a very nicely sized gem, remains underappreciated. In addition to solid growth we continue to build on our brand mission social responsibility. I want to underline this, because I believe that this is something that we\u2019ll continue to talk about as we go forward.","Athleta has become a B or benefit Corp certified. Certification requires meeting rigorous standards across social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. This makes Gap Inc. the largest U.S. publicly traded retail company with a B Corp certified subsidiary apparel brand. Why does this matter? This matters because this is a critical component of Athleta\u2019s strong brand identity and strong brand engagement. I'm very proud of the team, and very proud of the significant step that we\u2019ve taken forward.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Terry and she will provide some specifics around key financial highlights throughout the business. Teri.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks Art and good afternoon. As you heard from Art\u2019s comments, quarter did present some challenges, some were largely expected like the Gap brand operating issues and other were less predictable like unseasonably cold and snowy weather. In the face of this, we were pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comps. We continue to feel very good about the balanced growth strategy, and the underlying momentum of the business, which allows us to maintain our outlook for the year.","For the quarter the issue that Gap brand drove the majority of the gross margin to leverage. As you know, Gap brand has been undergoing significant operating model improvements over the past year, and there have been changes to both processes and people over that time. And while we\u2019re confident these changes will prove to be positive over the long run, the customers steps for the spring summer season. The root cause of the challenges is not significant product acceptance issues, but rather operational miss steps around timing of inventory received, breath of the assortment and lack of gaps in some categories.","On last quarter\u2019s call, we talked about being heavy on inventory and Gap brand heading into Q1, which impacted gross margin as expected. In addition, we had some receipt flow issues that compounded the problem. Throughout the quarter, the timing of inventory flows affected the time on offer and the ability to optimize margin. We\u2019re addressing the issues that affected margin in the quarter. We expect pressure to continue into Q2, but not to the same degree we experienced in Q1, as we\u2019ve already moved aggressively to enter the back half in much better shape.","During the quarter, we made some strategic decisions to aggressively clear inventory through sell-off. We also incurred some expense as we proactively cut CCs originally planned for the back half. While these actions negatively impacted margin rate in the quarter, it does set us up for cleaner stores in Q2 and better inventory positioning for the back half.","Now most importantly, we\u2019re re-instilling operating discipline and leadership accountability across the organization. In February, we announced the appointment of an interim leader for Gap brand with extensive operations experience, and he is doing an excellent job with the team to ride the ship and ensure the second half we gain some momentum we\u2019ve been seeing prior to these operational issues.","So now, let me turn to the first quarter performance. And I\u2019d like to note our first quarter reported results include the impact from the adoption of the revenue recognition standards. And as a reminder, the adoption isn\u2019t expected to be impactful to our earnings, but it will change the classification of certain line items in our P&L. The most significant impact comes from the recognition of income related to our credit card and loyalty program. And historically, this income was classified as an offset to SG&A and COGs. But under the new rules, we are presenting this income in sales.","For the first quarter, the accounting change resulted in an increase of $141 million to net sales, an increase of $91 million to gross margin, as well as $92 million increase in operating expenses. To be helpful, we\u2019ve included a slide in our quarterly earnings presentation and a table in our press release that details Q1 2018 results with and without the impacts from adoption. Both can be found on the investor section of gapinc.com and of course will be available after the call to help with any modeling question.","So let me start with sales. Due to 53rd week in fiscal year 2017, for consistency, our Q1 2018 comparable sales are compared to the 13 week period ended May 6, 2017. On this basis, the Company\u2019s comp sales for Q1 2018 were up 1%. As I said, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. Now, we haven\u2019t quantified the weather impact on the quarter, but after what has been reported to be the coldest winter in several years and the snowy in April in 21 years, should assume weather negatively impacted the quarter. As you would expect, the Northeast, where weather was particularly unseasonable, heads off to performance.","Our net sales for the quarter were $3.8 billion. When excluding the impacts from the adoption of the new rev rack standard, this represents growth of about 6% over Q1 2017. On this basis, a little more than half of the five point spread between net sales growth and comp sales was due to the impact of the calendar shift created by the 53rd week in 2017. As a reminder, this year\u2019s first quarter dropped a small week in February and a larger more full priced selling week in May.","Now at the brand level, despite unseasonably colder weather throughout the quarter, Old Navy delivered positive three comps against last year\u2019s very strong plus eight. We are pleased to see another quarter of broad based strength across all categories, and positive AUR as Old Navy continues to grow its market share and solidifies position as a top apparel brand. We also were pleased that Banana Republic delivered a positive three comps against negative for last year. This is the second consecutive quarter of positive comp for Banana as it continues to focus on pillar categories.","Similar to Old Navy, Banana achieved growth in nearly every category. At Gap, comp sales were down 4 against negative 4 last year for the reasons we talked about. And as Art mentioned, the trend in both Athleta and in our online business, remained very strong. Despite the gap impact, we were pleased to deliver our sixth consecutive quarter of positive AUR growth, driven by old navy and Banana Republic.","Turning to gross margin. On a reported basis, gross margin was 37.7%, $91 million or 100 basis points of expansion was driven by revenue recognition adoption. Excluding net impact, first quarter gross margin declined 120 basis points, driven by merchandise margin decline of 180 basis points, partially offset by 60 basis points of rent and occupancy leverage. The merch margin was at the lower end of our planning scenarios. Some of the wet weather impact but the majority was due to the strategic decisions we made at Gap brand to more aggressively clear inventory. This accounted for about $28 million or 80 basis points of merch margin deleverage. The remaining deleverage was driven by higher promotional activity at Gap brand. Rent and occupancy leverage was primarily driven by the shift caused by the 53rd week last year.","On SG&A, again on a reported basis, first quarter total operating expenses were $1.2 billion. The adoption of rev rec resulted in the $92 million increase in operating expenses, and accounted for 130 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Excluding the impact from the adoption of rev rec, first quarter SG&A leveraged about 10 basis points, also benefiting from the calendar shift. We remain focused on productivity and total high level expenses during the quarter. The entire company is engaged in how we can drive operational efficiency. These efforts increased the quality and efficiency of our processes and free up funding for growth investments. A good example is store technology where we\u2019re adding new mobile devices that improve our in-stock levels and speed up the check-out process, both levers that can improve conversion and deliver growth.","Moving to taxes, our first quarter effective rate was 25.1%. The lower rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings and we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of about 26%.","On earnings, our first quarter earnings per share were $0.42, which included the benefits and the calendar shift created by the 53rd week last year. FX did not have a material impact on earnings per share. Free cash flow was negative $204 million, which reflect the higher bonus payout versus last year. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, comfortably within our target cash threshold.","Consistent with our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, we completed $100 million of share repurchase in Q1, and paid dividend of $94 million. We ended the quarter with $387 million shares outstanding. We ended the quarter with inventory up 4% compared with the first quarter of 2017. This incorporates some lower in-transit inventory effect due to timing. While we are heavier on inventory at Gap brand than we would have liked, overall, we feel good about where we ended the quarter for the Company.","Regarding capital and store count, our capital expenditures were $138 million. On a net basis, we\u2019ve opened six company operated stores to-date and ended the quarter with 3,171 company operated store. In line with our strategy, openings are focused on the value and active space, while closures will continue to be weighted towards Gap and Banana Republic specialty.","While there were challenges in the quarter, Q1 results were within the range of scenarios embedded in our initial full year outlook. We are affirming our full-year earnings per share guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70. Although, clearly our ability to get to the high end of that range, will be more challenging given the Q1 start. As I have noted, when we saw weather trends improve, we saw a dramatic inflection in trends across the portfolio and we feel good with our start to Q2.","With regards to Gap, as we said last March, we expected challenges to pressure the first half. And we continue to expect margin pressure in the second quarter, but not to the same degree we saw in the first quarter, given we\u2019ve had the chance to impact the quarter. While we do not guide the gross margin at the Gap Inc level for Gap brand, we do expect merch margin pressure to be about half of what the brand experience in the first quarter.","We said that some degree of quarter variability is evitable, considering our portfolio brands and macro factors. We are making the decisions that we believe are consistent with our balanced growth strategy, which is the right path forward for the Company. We still have opportunities to improve as already indicated, particularly as we work through the operational issues with the Gap brand. But the underlying fundamentals of our portfolio brands against our strategic priorities remain strong.","Just a couple of housekeeping matters before I turn it back over to Art. Regarding the 53rd week, as a reminder, our annual guidance range includes the negative impact from the loss of the 53rd of about $0.06. We do not expect the timing shift caused by the 53rd week to have a meaningful impact on the second or the third quarter. Just as the first quarter benefited from the calendar shift, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by more than the shift benefited Q1 due to the loss in third week.","And then on the adoption of rev rec and our guidance, in March, we provided full year 2018 guidance for net sales spread and SG&A as a percentage of sales. Specifically, we note that for the full year 2018, we expect spread to be flat to up slightly as we expect a loss of the 53rd week to be offset by new store sales growth and the translation benefit from foreign exchange. And SG&A, as a percent of net sales, to be about flat if productivity offsets increased investments.","Just to clear up any confusion, because there are lot of moving parts and everyone reporting these days. This guidance holds when looking at year-over-year comparison on a like-for-like basis with and without the impact of revenue recognition.","So with that, I am going to turn it back over to Art.","Art Peck","Thanks Teri, appreciate it. This is for those of you that attend this call on an ongoing basis, this is where it ends. But I really do want to underline a few points here and obviously we\u2019ll open it up for questions. A few points that are important to me, and I believe super critical to the overall investment thesis of the Company. First, I cannot underline enough our balanced growth strategy. We are heads down, executing against it. Teri outlined the components. We\u2019re going to continue to push down that path and I have absolute conviction that it is the right path for the Company.","I want to talk about productivity for a moment. And we\u2019ve talked about this, Teri mentioned this, I want to underline it and point out to you my conviction about the opportunity and my conviction about the fact that we will deliver against this opportunity. We did note that there was expense leverage in the quarter and some benefit from the 53rd week. But in line with guidance, the entire Company is taking an intense consistent and ongoing look at how we drive operational efficiency in our cost structure.","Real estate is another critical area and we spend a lot of time talking with you about real estate. We continue to optimize the fleet, and we will continue to optimize the fleet, including reducing exposure to low productivity stores wherever they are, but these largely are mall base and are represented by the specialty portion of our footprint. At the same time, we do see a store growth opportunity, and we will continue to invest in stores where we can achieve quality, growth and quality profitability. In some places, that means opening new locations, largely in the value and active space, meaning Athleta, Old Navy and the factory and outlet expressions at Banana Republic and Gap.","We\u2019re also renovating some current locations that are healthy and productive, but where we know we can see even greater upside. We\u2019re starting to see the results of the work, and 2017 store traffic outpaced industry trends all year and that continued into Q1 across the portfolio. I also noted that we have a large and fast growing online and mobile business. It\u2019s a critical component. It is one of the largest online apparel businesses in the world. And it is one we have deep conviction to continue to grow and continue to invest in.","We\u2019re also investing in store technology. We\u2019re adding new mobile devices that can improve our in-stock and service levels, and speed up the check out process. We\u2019re also lighting up, in Old Navy, buy online and pickup in store, which we believe has the opportunity to continue to unlock how the customer shops seamlessly across both of our channels. We believe these levers can improve conversion, and we\u2019re investing in digital experience and fulfillment initiatives beyond this that enable us to engage with our customers in a more meaningful way.","In closing, I want to reiterate the confidence that Teri and I both have in the strategy and in the Company. We outlined this last fall and it has remained steadfast and unchanged. We\u2019re focused on balance growth, continuing to support accelerating growth in active and value, supporting and investing in our progress in digital and accelerating the growth of our digital business, and how that connects to customer experience, rationalizing non-performing real estate and driving SG&A productivity.","The last point that I want to underline is one that -- honestly there has been relatively little dialogue, but it\u2019s still material and important. And that is the benefit that we receive from tax reform changes. As I noted in our end of year call, this does open up significantly the earnings capacity of the Company.","Thank you. And now we\u2019ll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We\u2019ll take our first question today from Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","You outlined a number of issues impacting the Gap banner business. Can you just rank for us what was most impactful to the banner in 1Q, and what exactly is improving to alleviate the margin pressure as we go into the second quarter and will allow for a bounce in the business in the second half? If it\u2019s the inventory position improve processes, et cetera.","Teri List-Stoll","Obviously, over the course of the quarter, we were able to impact a number of the components that brought us to where we were in Q1. Meaning we were able to stabilize the processes, we were able to get in and try to address some of the inventory issues. But just because of the lead time that exists, we simply were not able to get through it all. And that\u2019s part of the reason we made so much painful decision to strategically sell off some of the inventory and just get it clean.","As we got in there and realized that there was an addition to the flow timing, there was an assortment issue. We just ended up being more over assorted than we think is good for the brand and the stores were just not clean enough to allow our customers to really see through to the probably the brand and product we have there. So as part of that, we made a decision to job out some inventory and then we worked aggressively to start cutting forward receipts. But some of that will come through in Q2, which is why we see the moderating effects, but it won\u2019t be all the way bride and tell the second half.","ArtPeck","And let me add a little bit to that, because it support and I think it\u2019s a really critical question. So just to build on Teri, rightsizing our inventories, we wanted to accelerate the movement of units to the business and we took action, which we felt maximize the yield out of all those units. But it was inside of our stores were jobbing inventory out. My experience now has been, and this is universal, is if you have too much inventory or the wrong inventory, holding onto it does not make it better. And so we were decisive on that and took those actions. It wasn\u2019t with our pain, but we believe it was absolutely the right thing to do to continue to clean up the business and position it for better performance as we get into Q2 and then into the back half. So that was critical.","We\u2019ve also narrowed and cut back on CC and style assortments as we get into fall and particularly in holiday. What allows us to do is; number one, clear point of view and the stores; secondly, more depth behind our big key items and our drivers, which is always important in this business. There were also some technical issues as we\u2019ve been standing up our inventory assortment and allocation tools, and we identified those and have resolved those. And those were not immaterially important in many of the late POs that got -- that were being placed, and we\u2019ve resolved that largely fully as we get into the back half.","So there's a number of material things that we did, knowing where we wanted the business to be. And again, we took action quickly and decisively to make those changes.","Paul Trussell","Really quick follow-up, I just wanted to touch on the slide in your presentation that shows quite strong one line growth. Can you just speak about the drivers overall to the acceleration this past quarter and perhaps which beginners are contributing the most of that growth? And then lastly on online, just curious if you can speak to the margin profile of that business today?","ArtPeck","The thing that makes me most pleased to talk about the acceleration and strength of the online growth is that it\u2019s not one thing or one brand. It is very diversified across our portfolio, and it is not predicated on one specific aspect. If I could just tick through a few things, we\u2019ve continued to focus on growing our customer file, starting with customer information capture in our stores and the other aspects that we bring customers into active relationships with the company. We\u2019ve had an enterprise wide executive on that now and it\u2019s -- enterprise wide incentive on that as part of the bonus structure now in its second year, and we\u2019re getting significant traction on that. That's related to our traffic and to our file size.","And then it\u2019s a wide variety of things, whether it's service-level on our basic products, improving our site load speeds, continuing to improve our app experience, which now is all closing in on five stars in terms of their rating, continuing to tune and tweak and test our checkout process, our navigation process. I mean what the reality of the online businesses is that it is about a constant set of incremental improvements, none of which turn the trajectory of the business, but all add up to see what I hope you find we do to be a very satisfying acceleration of the growth rate of the business across the portfolio.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","As you think about the Gap brand and the changes going on there. What do you think in product acceptance that gives confidence in the improving trajectory at Gap? And also, anymore color on Banana, what you\u2019re seeing there and same thing for Old Navy? Thank you, bye.","ArtPeck","Thanks Dana, it\u2019s a very good question. And let me just talk across that. And this was very much on my mind. We mentioned the weather challenges. You know what the weather has been like as it was in Q1 where seasonable cool rain, snow et cetera. Obviously, a number of people, including us, saw that that had some impact on the business. Not being one to casually play the weather card, I spend a disproportionate amount of my time in our stores and looking at our product reviews across all of our brands online, digging super deep to see if we were fully ourselves, or if there was actually some product acceptance issue.","Now you know, we will never have all of our product perfect, but I also know that I have a sufficiently good relationship with the stores that if we have product issues, they are going to tell me about it when we go in the stores. And I did not come away with a belief that there was a significant product acceptance issue. There is a style here, a color there, et cetera, but we feel good across the whole portfolio that we actually had strong product that was on trend and probably assorted.","Now in Gap brand, the issue was as we\u2019ve noted, the net of the impact of the receipts CC and style expansion that did result in the fact that the stores looked and felt and were over-assorted. I think the change in the stores has been obvious as we've taken some of the inventory levels down and got to some of the styles and CCs out. And what\u2019s left is product that can breathe seasonally appropriate and we\u2019re seeing the customer respond to it.","And again, I can say key categories worth working, the body business is very strong, we\u2019re seeing good strength in bottoms and particularly in denim. When the weather turned, we saw the shorts business come back online across the company. So Gap no significant problems. In Banana, the assortments has and will continue to quiet down with some of the excess detail and fashion frills being removed from the assortment, the color pallets has quieted down back to where Banana should be, which is a bit of color in print on a platform of sophisticated, easy to wear and versatile neutrals. We've improved the fabrications, our customers responding to it. The dresses business is very strong as are several of the other businesses.","And so we knew that when we made those changes, the customer is going to respond, because the feedback was clear and we're seeing exactly the response that we expected. And then the men's business has continued to chug along, and is quite solid there. With the notable issue in the men's business that as we've continued to introduce innovation, largely at the fiber yarn and fabric level with our stretch fabrications but our 37.5 fabrication, et cetera. We've seen men responded in a really good way to the innovation that we're bringing into ready to wear apparel.","Old Navy, I was in there in mid-April and I was wondering, do we have too many off the shoulder tops and dresses. The weather turned and we've seen the sell through go to where we expected them to be. We had probably a little bit of over assortment in some prints and women's dresses. And again, we've moved through those issues; she's responding across the assortment; Denim is good; kids and baby business is solid; and the men's business continues to chug along as well.","And then in Athleta, again, strong performance; swim is important in this quarter; and swim was not quite as strong as we wanted it to be; I mean, it's not a huge driver in the business; but that's the one place where we've looked at and said, geez, we've probably got some issues there relative to the color palette, et cetera. But largely and holistically, I am very pleased with our product acceptance.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chethan Mallela, Barclays.","Chethan Mallela","So I wanted ask about the gross margin performance in the quarter, and it\u2019s clear that Gap rent and the inventory clear out had a sizeable impact. But can you give us a sense of how margins trended, excluding those issues and how you think about gross margins once you get past them?","Teri List-Stoll","So as you think about gross margin for the quarter, once you sort through all the economy changes and so forth. You have to remember that compare on gross margin is actually against a very healthy improvement in Q1 of last year. So we already are against a pretty quality compare. And so as we think about -- I'm not going to dissect it down, to take out the various components. But I would say, you can probably get some sense of the impact of those.","And then as we see that moderating, the Gap brand and impacts moderating in Q2 and then moving to the back half, we have no reason to believe given the AUR strength we\u2019ve been seeing, the focus we have on AUC that we wouldn't get back to a more typical margins with opportunity to continue to focus on how we expand those by focusing on our loyalty categories and driving growth in places where we have clear opportunity to win.","Operator","Next up we'll hear from Brian Tunick from the Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","I guess Art, I was curious on two fronts. One, maybe to hear your thoughts, other people that are talking about a fashion cycle emerging right now, and obviously, you're talking about record denim result. So curious if you're seeing, or the organization thinks, we're on the cusp or seeing a fashion cycle or a big shift happening? And then the second point, you've talked about market share opportunities before. So it sounds like fast fashion no longer gaining market share. Do you see opportunities in the same malls, or strip centers where you\u2019re located? Thank you very much.","ArtPeck","So on the fashion cycle, I\u2019m hearing about that as well. And honestly, my experience is that you can find whatever fashion cycle you want, if you look hard enough and talk to enough people. What we\u2019re really seeing is continued solid growth and consistent expenditures across the key categories in our business versus any particular distortion. Now, there's a little bit of a 90s fashion cycle that\u2019s out there that absolutely plays to the strength of our brands. In Banana, there's a little bit of a utility and Safari cycle out there that we\u2019re continuing to build in as we get into the summer and fall, and that's obviously the heritage of the brand expressing that in a really nice sophisticated way, and she and he are responding to it.","We don't see right now, however, any significant distortion. I mean, the Denim business is strong across rise and silhouette, midrise we\u2019re seeing high-rise business which we bought into as well. There's some wide leg pants silhouette out there. But it's a smaller trend and it\u2019s not a hugely democratic trend. So we actually feel like we\u2019re well invested with depth behind our ideas in key categories in the business, and don't see something that is flash in the pan distortion right now.","The market share we are seeing, I believe, comes from a combination of things, being on trend in our key categories, being well priced in those categories, delivering value that the customer understands and relates to, and then offering a super easy and convenient and accessible shopping experience across mobile, online and in our stores in a way that is converge. So it allows her to engage our brands in the easiest way that's possible, which to me is all good news, because it says that solid consistent execution is what is going to carry the day, and that is very much what we\u2019re focused on.","And I think you asked a second question or a part to that, which I -- in my incredibly informative answer, I have spaced, but maybe not\u2026","Brian Tunick","No it was along the same lines about how fast fashion is giving us there as well.","ArtPeck","I mean, it\u2019s still out there certainly. And whenever I hear fast fashion, I say you need to tease apart fast and fashion, because part of the work that we've done in our product delivery capabilities has been about getting faster. I think that we do see a backlash a bit in disposable fashion. And this is something I mentioned in my remarks, purpose driven brands, it's been a buzzword. We see it becoming more and more of a reality. And it\u2019s certainly manifesting itself most significantly in Athleta.","The great majority, part of being B Corp certified in Athleta with the great majority of the product is on sustainable fabrications. And we find that the customer is responding to that. So that a little bit of a backlash against the waste and disposability is something that I think benefits our business where across all our businesses we have always stood for a quality that the customer understood and items that lasted.","Operator","Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley has the next question.","Kimberly Greenberger","My question is on the outlets. But I just wanted to clarify something first with Teri, if I could. I think with -- it's on the ROD leverage in the quarter, I think you said 60 basis points of ROD leverage. But if I look at the 6% sales growth, I just would have thoughts perhaps there would be more ROD leverage in there given that back in the third quarter, I think you cited 60 basis points of ROD leverage with only 1% growth rate in revenue. So I just want to make sure I heard that right, and if you could talk about the why the ROD leverage wasn't better. And then, Art, on the outlets, obviously, you talked about pursuing quality growth. And I am just wondering, do you think that the outlet growth, in particular, for Gap and Banana Republic, could be cutting into your specialty business and basically driving some of the declines in that specialty business? Thanks.","ArtPeck","Why don\u2019t I answer that first and then I\u2019ll turn it back to Teri on the ROD leverage question. It\u2019s a really good question to think about what\u2019s the right proportion of outlets or factory stores to the specialty stores. And it is something we look at. We have data that helps us understand cross-shopping patterns. And obviously, outlets have moved from intentionally un-convenient geographic locations to be now more urban and suburban locations. So there is probably some impact.","That said, we do have very attractive economics in our outlet channel. So the impact is something that we\u2019re very comfortable managing our way through in terms of the impact that it has on our economics, if we intelligently and responsibly manage our commitments to specialty real estate. And that is what we've been doing now for over a decade.","That all said, the bigger impacts on our specialty business and specialty fleet and this is -- starts first with Gap, is the fact that Gap has been around for a long time. And as customer shopping patterns have changed, many of those stores that were productive 20 or 30 or even 40 years ago, are now in malls or locations that have been bypassed by job patterns, education patterns, housing patterns, et cetera. And so that's the work that we've been doing. It\u2019s largely driven by getting Gap out of places where customer shopping patterns have bypassed the real estate. We\u2019ll always manage the ratio of outlets to specialty very carefully. So I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable and I am with where that ratio stands today. Teri, let me turn it over to you.","Teri List-Stoll","Kimberly, on your ROD question, so we\u2019ve been saying that we need a mid single digit comp to leverage ROD, so that we\u2019ve been pretty consistent. You see a lower threshold. But as we\u2019ve deployed incremental capital to store growth and some of the investments we\u2019ve been making to set ourselves up well for growth, that has moved more towards mid single digit. And so that\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019re seeing flow through in Q1.","Operator","Next is Matthew Boss from JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","I guess, Art, at the core Gap if we look at the operational mix there. Is it fair to judge the brand by your back-to-school assortment that we were thinking about products, as well as performance? And are you -- I guess, Teri, are you embedding positive comps at the Gap concept in the back half of the year. Just how best to think about the progression of same store sales from $0.04.","Teri List-Stoll","So as you think about the momentum we started to see in the Gap brand last year, we actually ended up in Q4 with a positive comp and we had been building from that with investments we've been making, including some stepped up advertizing. And so were seeing improved traffic comps and just a better overall engagement with the customer on the brand. And so those dynamics are still there. Our traffic remains better than the industry on the Gap brand, and so the issue that we\u2019re seeing is the inability to deliver on the expectation of the customer given our inventory issues.","And so I don't have a specific guide for comp for Gap brand in the second half. But I would say if you look at the fundamentals and then you take out the issues that have been affecting the inventory in the Q1 and we expect to continue to lesser degree in Q2, there's no reason that we wouldn't quickly get back to the momentum that we're seeing in. And one of the things we've been doing is because we believe in the brand and we believe in the fundamentals, while we're being super disciplined down the cost structure and the business, we're not cutting back on things that are fundamentally important to sustaining the brand health that we've been building back up. So that we can be as well positioned in the second half to get that positive comp that we saw in Q4 of 2017.","ArtPeck","And I would just underline the fact that we talked -- we saw Gap\u2019s issues before we formulated our guidance for this year. We reiterated our guidance as we have seen Gap\u2019s issues and gotten our arms around them. And then to your specific question, Matt, on back-to-school, as back-to-school aligns with the beginning of the back half, that is when we feel like we're largely out of the operational issues. And changes that we've made in terms of inventory assortment, breadth, CC and style count should start to impact.","Teri List-Stoll","Matt, I just want to go back. And so I think I said Gap brand was positive in Q4, they were positive in Q3 back of flat as we get up. I apologize for the miss statement there.","Matthew Boss","Just a quick follow up on the expense front. I guess, how should we think about SG&A dollar growth in the first quarter relative to the balance of the year? And just larger picture, do you believe you have the right investments in place today to drive operational performance going forward, or anything that we would think about larger picture in terms of incremental investments that you'd like to make?","ArtPeck","Let me talk about the incremental investment and then we can -- I can hand it back to Teri on the expense growth. I mean, we've obviously indicated our appetite for both our CapEx and our OpEx. So let me use Fishkill as an example. We\u2019re in the final stages of standing up the rebuild of the Fishkill facility after the fire. That is significantly upped our game in terms of the automation of that facility. In terms of receding -- stocking the inventory, picking the inventory and then shipping the inventory, and that's something that we've had and intend to do for a while. It improves our efficiency and our effectiveness through our fulfillment operations.","Another one is we're continuing to invest in bringing the relevant technology and putting it into the hands of our sales associates in our store. We\u2019ve talked BOPIS, which is in Old Navy now, which we're going to continue to roll across the fleet. We have a really exciting on-shelf in-stock app that we've now deployed on iOS devices in our stores that is an exception based restock app, tied to -- especially a redesign of our stock rooms. And we're seeing so far in the very early days a significant improvement in on-floor service levels and the reduction in payroll. So we get an efficiency benefit as well in terms of the re-plan hours that we spend keeping our stores in stock. And those were a couple of examples.","Do we have all of the right investments? No, there\u2019s probably 2x what we're spending if I met all of the demand across the organization. But we do feel that responding -- spending at a responsible level that we have set the right priorities this year and as we go forward in terms of where we're applying that investment.","Teri List-Stoll","So on SG&A, we provided the guidance that for the year we expected SG&A as a percent of sales to be about flat. And that reverses the trend where we have historically over the recent past we\u2019ve been deleveraging somewhere around 170 basis points. And so what you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter is a dramatic reversal of what we saw in Q1 of last year. In fairness, it is helped by the 53rd week but still it does show that the work is starting to take root and we\u2019re getting some of that expense to been under control. While as I said investing in the initiatives that we believe are highest priority to deliver the best return to the enterprise.","Operator","Next up from Jefferies is Randy Konik.","Randy Konik","Art, hate to beat to the dead horse here. So can you just go back on the historical timeline just so overall on the call of where of what the actual issues were at the Gap from a process standpoint, when -- why did the processes change? When you identified those issues? And the processes are either going back to what they were before they changed? Just want to just get some more specifics there, just so we can put this issue to bed as we move forward here.","ArtPeck","It\u2019s a really good question, and I thank you for giving me the platform for talking about it. So we\u2019ve been moving, as I\u2019ve been talking to you about for a while, across the entire company as we\u2019ve continued to accelerate our product processes and reduced our time from concept to shelf. And that's largely gone quite well without any bumps in the road. And I\u2019ve cited several examples across the company where that is manifesting itself in the form of business outcomes, not the least of which in a small way, but increasingly large way, Athleta\u2019s bottoms complex that went from 60s week 60 to eight to 10 weeks, and is allowing us to fuel that growth with units. So that\u2019s an example. And we have been doing it all the way across the company.","Adjacent to that is we\u2019ve been standing up a new tool from -- that is basically applied against the assorting and the buying and allocation process of our business to modernize our inventory management capabilities. And we\u2019ve been implementing that and getting it online by module in different parts of the Company. And one of the modules inside of Gap as we were speeding of product processes we ran into some, both process issues and capability issues and some technical issues, which resulted as we saw in Q4 some late placements of PO's.","And essentially just to be simple about it, we\u2019re requiring more discipline and more precision in the specification on our products upfront so that we can then release those to our sourcing office and to our vendors in final form. Previously in a system that was much more informal, there was lot of iteration that went back and forth on POs that released to get to the final products back. So it actually yields a better and more disciplined process and can continue to help us accelerate.","But change management and some technical issues resulted in a fact that getting those POs right before they were released upstream meant that we ended up with many of them being late, and that's really the issue that the biggest issue from a technical and process standpoint that we've been wrestling through. The second component of that was the relentless creep of style and CC count. And that -- we added with all the best intent some styles in CCs. And the combination of those two things resulted in the inventory issues that we had, as well as the over assortment issue that was very evident in many of our stores.","While we took the action on inventory very quickly, it\u2019s why going forward, we have whacked back styles in CCs. It allows us to deploy the buy more productively behind our big ideas. And I'm quite confident that we have resolved the technical and the capability, and the process issues that were conducted to the late POs in the first place. A logical question that you would ask is, am I going to see this issue pop up elsewhere in the company, and the answer is absolutely not. We have run this with the ground. We know what it is. We have resolved it. And as I said, we expect to see this behind us as we get into the back half year.","Randy Konik","So just to pull all together, you\u2019re saying the PO problem is done. The inventory is still heavy at the Gap. I thought those been worked on, we should get those in line with trend by the end of the second quarter, such that we should expect core merchandise margin to do what it\u2019s going to do based on product acceptance in the back half and not be impacted by any type of technical or project issues.","ArtPeck","On natural pressures\u2026","Randy Konik","Yes, all right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","ArtPeck","And I just want to -- let me just -- go ahead. I just want to finish up on this one, because it\u2019s important. That's correct. I also just want to underline the fact that there is pressure in this quarter, as Teri noted, from the fact that we took very swift and very decisive action on inventory. There is always a temptation in this business to say okay I got as, I\u2019m going to write it out, and I will sell it, and I\u2019ll have a big sale, and all those kind of things. We looked at it and we said, we want to get this done. We want to get it clean. And we want to get behind us. And we\u2019re not perfect right now. But by taking those actions, I think you can see if you go into our stores, you should see stores where particularly in the women's assortment, the product is now clear, the ideas are clear and the product and breath. Again, inventory is not perfect but we took a significant one-time correction to get it done and get it behind us.","Operator","Okay, our next question will come from Mark Altschwager, Baird.","Mark Altschwager","I was hoping if you could talk about Old Navy for a moment, and just where you see the most opportunity from a unit expansion standpoint and the near-term. And I was hoping you could specifically address the strategy with respect to competitor exits? With some upcoming department store closures and otherwise underserved and maybe small and medium-size markets, but seen there some pretty identifiable share opportunities out there. So curious how you\u2019re thinking about that and may be leaning into it? Thanks.","ArtPeck","Yes, we are highly aligned on our perspective. So thank you. I really appreciate you taking this up. So if you think about market share, I have a very simple model in my mind, which my team now has, I made sure, has in their minds as well. And that revenue comes in varying degrees of quality. And I think about it in concentric circles. And the bull's-eye in the concentric circle is a dollar of AUR that goes through our existing stores, because that dollar should have a drop rate that is darn close to 100%, from the standpoint of income -- revenue to income.","And we are not in Old Navy and our other brands. We are not -- we are significantly focused on how do we continue to improve our AURs, and Teri spent some time on that. Part of that is mix, as we continue to invest in categories that drive higher AURs, growth in the bottoms business. Growth in Denim is a great example of that, and that's where we continue to gain market share. And part of that, obviously, is yield, where we are very focused on yield management, and making sure that while we are appropriately promotional that we continue to focus on yield management, and every dollar possible out of every unit that goes through our stores.","So the energy of the business starts with how do we get maximum gross margin dollars out of every square foot of existing real estate, which is a fixed cost. That is a very high quality revenue. The second piece of that is adding additional categories or units to our stores. And we are doing that now. Part of what we get out of our responsive capabilities, and this is a big part of what's driving Old Navy's Denim business, is we're able to feed units in close into season and take advantage where we have a hot trend, where we have a hot silhouette, where we just see good traffic in order to drive units through those stores.","And so we continue to see a unit growth opportunity in Old Navy and in our other businesses, but in Old Navy, as we continue to invest in the key categories and put the depth behind and drive our business; and that's bottoms; that's knits; that's the active space; that's kid's and baby, et cetera. A third piece is to add new categories to our stores, and we will always look at doing that and we are an Old Navy. We added active a couple of years ago that was significantly accretive to revenue and profitability. And we're always looking at places to say how do we actually get a higher share of wallet, and build out a bigger opportunity. We had another Denim set inside of the box, which has helped us continue to expand the Denim business in the women's. We're looking at assortment opportunities also inside of men's.","And so that's the construct, which is first and foremost, leverage our fixed cost base by AUR and additional units to our business. That's a big opportunity for us. And as Old Navy gain share, it's very high quality revenue. And then there's additional square footage. And we do see an opportunity there. We said we're on track for 60 new units this year of old navy. Those are largely conventional stores, no trickiness at all associated with them. And some of them are infill in major metropolitan areas. As an example, here in the Bay area, there\u2019s an Old Navy store going in Concord at the Veranda, which is a new shopping center that's cropping up, very close to an existing Old Navy store. And we're interested but different traffic patterns, interested in reading that, so we see significant infill opportunities, that's part of the 60.","And then we brought our targets down around size of metropolitan area, and we are finding that there are smaller population areas that do to closures and mall closures and consolidations are underserved today where there is a very nice Old Navy opportunities. So we have not put a specific storable out there, but we're very bullish and very encouraged by the opportunity to continue to build more units. And we do look at the off price space and their unit count, and see that Old Navy is significantly underrepresented and we think there's upside there. So again, super bullish on it.","And then the last thing I would say is do not underestimate the importance and the power of the online business. Old Navy has the lowest penetration but it's important and it continues to accelerate in its growth rate and it just a material growth driver for this company that has excellent economics.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Inc. First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O'Connell","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. For those of you participating in the webcast, please turn to Slides 2 and 3.","I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations of measures we're required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's press release, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 23, 2013, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining us on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, who will take you through the Q1 financial highlights, I want to take you through how we, as a business, are looking at the first quarter and also, I want to give you an update on our key initiatives for 2013.","The one thing that comes to mind when I think about Q1 was the consumer. Now we've been operating pretty much for the last 5-plus years in a very challenging environment. And this is the first quarter in a long time that I think the consumer, to us, felt like they were moving in a positive direction. Things are still challenging, but they're starting to feel a little bit better for a lot of reasons that I'm sure we've all read about or know about. So I'd like to think that that's a good sign as we look forward to the rest of the year.","Obviously, the news story is that we were able to get a 2 comp in Q1 2013 on top of the 4 comp we had in 2012, also known as comp-to-comp. Last year was obviously a good performance for the business, driven by the investments we made in product and in marketing. There was a little bit of weather help in 2012 and there was a color trend, but I think our teams came out very strongly in this first quarter. And I think it's nice to see across all of our businesses good 2-year comp performance in our 3 key brands.","Now to me, the big driver that continues to be our product, and we continue to have good product momentum. Now comp is an outcome. And all of our merchants and designers and marketers and our brand presidents know it takes good, strategic thinking on where we're going to dominate and where we're going to differentiate in each one of our categories that builds up to a comp. So when I looked at the quarter and I looked at the categories that -- Banana Republic and Gap and Old Navy, the ones that drove over and above performance, were the categories that we're putting a lot of time, effort and money behind because we think we can get market share gains. We can get an edge and we can get more customers to engage with our brands by showing that these are the categories, whether it is suiting, whether it is bottoms, whether it is dresses; these are the categories that are going to differentiate ourselves against our competitors.","And lastly, in the quarter, just one more number I want to talk about was online had a 27% gain in revenue, and that's key to us. Everybody who knows our business, the multiple channels: outlet, specialty, franchise and in particular, online, it is really a key strategic initiative. So it was up 27%, while the majority of that base is in the United States, we are seeing really strong growth in Canada, Europe, China and now in Japan.","So let me just pivot for a second and talk about our strategic initiatives. First and foremost, it's about growth, how the company is going to grow, what new initiatives we have going on. We've been clear about where we're putting our investments, and in our February call, we reiterated that in our investor meeting in April, franchise store count is on track. We feel good about the countries we're going to enter. We feel good about the balance between Banana Republic and Gap. Our global outlet openings, everything is coming together on that front. Again, multiple country openings here in Canada, in Japan, in Europe, and I was just in China to see the fifth store open. That's a good opening for that. A very important channel in this most important of countries.","China, everything is going well. That team just continues to impress me. They have an aggressive agenda for 2013. For one, they're prepared and the consumer and the environment is just right for us in China. So I think everything there is all systems go.","Old Navy, Japan, we opened 9 stores in Q1. So we -- unlike most real estate, it's been my experience in the years I've been doing this, real estate tends to be back-end loaded. So I was very proud of the team that they opened so many stores up in the first quarter, and I'm going to be going there at the end of June. But for all intents and purposes, from the numbers, the customer feedback, the launch strategy, that's really impressive to see that. And that really gives us great confidence going forward.","Intermix is on track and Athleta openings are on track. They are absolutely executing as we would expect in these 2 developing brands. We feel good about the prospects for the rest of the year.","The last thing from our strategic initiatives I do want to touch on is omni-channel. In the quarter, we launched ship-from-store for Old Navy. All of Gap is now on ship-from-store, Banana Republic was in 2012. We're easing our way into getting more stores and more categories on, but the launch has been smooth. The store execution has been great. So this whole idea between a customer now going online and seeing that everything is available. As we've talked about many times, the psychological impact of showing an out of stock online, the majority of our customers, when they see an out of stock online, something not available, not in their size, not in the right color, then they assume it's not available in the store. So that is just, from a marketing perspective, huge value to us, but also the ability now to use our pools of inventory seamlessly and to take something from a store and ship it to an online customer; it's really just a preliminary step on this amazing continuum we have with the omni-channel.","We will be launching reserve-in-store next month. That's in Banana Republic and Gap. It's a pilot. But again, the ability for a customer to seamlessly engage with our business, to go online, see something that they love, reserve it, get down to the store, hopefully buy more, have an amazing customer experience, I think, is good for loyalty. The next step along our path to get to a true competitive advantage and differentiation in the marketplace by acknowledging that the way to win these days is with great product, compelling marketing and giving customers access to your business anywhere they want. That's why we call it easy-buy-anywhere.","With all that said, as I said in the press release, we're pleased with our first quarter. It's nice to get off to a good start. Now the first week of every month, and the first month of every quarter and the first quarter of every year are very important. So it's good that we got off to a good start in this first quarter of a new fiscal year. I'm going to hand it over now to Sabrina, who will take you through the financial highlights. Sabrina?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter performance represents meaningful progress against our 2013 financial goals, which include growing sales with healthy merchandise margins, managing our expenses in a disciplined manner and delivering operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth.","Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. Our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.71 versus $0.47 last year. However, it's important to note that of the 51% earnings per share growth in Q1, about 1\/2 was due to the benefits from the calendar shift and from the favorable resolution of tax issues. That said, we are pleased with our underlying operating performance for the quarter.","Here are some highlights. Net sales were up 7%. Comparable sales were up 2%. Operating income increased by $135 million or 34%, and operating margin expanded by 290 basis points to 14.2%. Net earnings were up $100 million or 43%.","Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. First quarter total sales were $3.7 billion, up 7%, with comp sales up 2%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release. Of the 5-percentage-point spread between total sales growth and comps sales growth, about 1\/2 was due to the impact of the calendar shift created by the 53rd week in fiscal year 2012. As a reminder, this year's first quarter dropped a small week in February and added a much larger, more full-priced selling week in May.","The translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $45 million in the first quarter. This translation impact was primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. In fiscal Q1 2013, the average exchange rate of the yen was roughly 18% less than for fiscal Q1 2012, or JPY 80 last year versus JPY 95 to the dollar this year.","Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 12% to $1.5 billion, and gross margin was up 200 basis points to 41.4%. Our merchandise margins were up 160 basis points, largely driven by decreases in average unit costs. And rent and occupancy leveraged 40 basis points.","Please turn to Slide 7 for operating expenses. First quarter total operating expenses were $1 billion, up $34 million from the prior year. Marketing expenses grew modestly by $4 million to $143 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses leveraged by 90 basis points. Expense leverage also benefited from the calendar shift in the quarter. Therefore, we would caution against extrapolating this magnitude of leverage to future quarters.","Delivering on our goals of sales growth and expense leverage resulted in net earnings of $333 million, up 43% to last year. As I've mentioned, our earnings in the quarter included about $0.04 of benefit related to the favorable resolution of tax issues in the first quarter. About $18 million of the benefit is reflected in interest, and the other $0.02 of benefit to EPS are reflected in the tax rate.","Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 8. Inventory dollars per store were up 3%, broadly in line with our comp sales growth. The plus 3% is on last year's 7% decrease in inventory dollars per store.","For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $205 million, roughly equal to last year. We ended with about $1.6 billion in cash. And we distributed $128 million through share repurchases and dividends. Our quarter end share count was 466 million.","Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. First quarter capital expenditures were $151 million. With regard to company-operated stores, we opened 10 stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,105 stores. Square footage was up 0.3% compared to Q1 2012. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.","And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 10. As we said in our April sales recording, our first quarter operating performance was broadly in line with our expectations at the time we provided our full year guidance in February. Therefore, nothing has meaningfully changed in our full year outlook, and we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance of $2.52 to $2.60.","To be helpful, there are 2 important considerations for the remainder of the year. First, as we told you on our Q4 call, our full year earnings guidance contemplated some of the impact of foreign currency headwinds, specifically, the weakening yen. Since we provided guidance in February, the spot rate for the yen has weakened by about another 10%. The average spot rate for the yen last year was about JPY 80, current spot rate is about JPY 103 or at about 29% depreciation. This depreciation negatively impacts our reported sales and earnings as our local currency results translate into fewer dollars. Second, as we've noted several times, the fourth quarter this year has 1 less selling week than the fourth quarter last year. Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2013 drops a large fall selling week. Therefore, just as the first quarter benefited from the calendar shift, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by an amount that is at least as large as the benefit we saw in Q1.","For the full year, the following guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged: operating margin about 13%; square footage, up about 1%. Regarding company-operated stores, net of repositions, we plan to open about 160 and close about 80; store openings are weighted toward Gap China, Old Navy Japan, Athleta and global outlets, while store closures are weighted towards Gap North America. We expect capital expenditures to be about $675 million, and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 39%. We expect Q2 inventory dollars per store to be up in the mid-single digits.","In closing, we're pleased with how we executed against our strategies in Q1, in particular, driving a positive comp and revenue growth on top of last year's strong performance. Of course, now we're focused on delivering our goals for the remainder of the year.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to John Morris, BMO.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I guess maybe, Glenn, you talked really effectively, you and your team, when we had the Investor Day about the seamless inventory initiative, which you touched on this morning in your prepared remarks. It sounds like it's rolling forward maybe a little bit faster and into place than some of us might expect, which is great. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the performance contribution potential you might see coming from that. I know it's hard to predict, but maybe it's helpful to think about it relative to some of the global competitors, who have some of those initiatives already in place that you would probably know about.","Glenn K. Murphy","Okay, John. I'd say there was really 2 parts that we talked about in April. So I'll just for -- from a terminology perspective, it was a seamless inventory. And the idea behind that, that's going to take a little bit longer. That's more of a midterm opportunity for the company. The idea behind seamless inventory is right now, as a company, and this is true of almost every single apparel company with likely the exception of Inditex, that we have inventory that is either in a country and that -- what is inside of a country like Japan and it's inside of a distribution center that's online, inside of a distribution center that could be for stores and then it's inside of our 150 stores in Japan. So the idea behind this is how do we, with the systems we put in place now and some changes in process, how do we make sure their inventory becomes seamless, so when it leaves a factory from a vendor that 100,000 unit PO that was agreed to weeks before that just before it leaves, it goes to the most appropriate country where it makes the most sense, where we can maximize our sales and maximize our gross margin dollars because it's matching supply with demand. And then when it gets inside of a country, again, how do we make it seamless between -- let's assume that you had a simple distribution center, that would make a big difference for us. And then when it gets inside of the distribution center, how do make sure it's seamless between the online channel and the stores? So that's a project that we've already done some work on. We're building the base and I think that's going to be more of a 2014 and beyond opportunity. The other part that could be, I guess, viewed as seamless inventory is what we're calling a more responsive supply chain. That is really that us, as a business, and this is something that in hindsight, I probably should've pushed a little more aggressively inside the company, but we've told people in the past that our supply chain needs -- in order to become more responsive, it needs to be built on having much more fabric platform inside of all of our mill relationships. Once you have fabric platform, then you could do -- you can be a lot quicker on basic inventory and seasonal basic inventory to get a read and respond. And we've done some of this and there are some of that going on in the company today. But I guess, if I was to characterize it, if we'll be considered to be world-class, we are probably the second from being in -- from the standing start, we're probably in the second inning right now of actually getting to a more responsive supply chain. Some of that will happen in 2013 a little bit. But again, most of the benefit from changing how we operate to changing the brand's operating model to be much more a responsive supply chain will happen in 2014.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Glenn, are those potentially contributive in the hundreds of basis points over time just order of magnitude benefit?","Glenn K. Murphy","It's tough to quantify. All we've said, John, before is that the people with the highest operating margin in our industry are in the high teens. And we are in the, call it, for argument's sake, the mid-teens. And some of that difference, not all of it, some of that difference is that they have embraced a more seamless inventory management operating model and their business was built on a responsive supply chain. So we're different businesses than the leaders when it comes to operating margin, but I think there's definitely some application for us that we're -- again, some of it is in place now, but a lot more to come. But it certainly doesn't explain the whole delta of 400- or 500-basis-point difference between ourselves and the leading company in our sector, but I think there are some differences. There are some of that can be explained through the fact that we haven't embraced, ourselves, those 2 opportunities. So more to come and we'll see if we can get it in place for 2014. But there's certainly value attached to it. I just can't quantify it for you today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Glenn, when you think about the operating margin opportunity from some of the strategic goals, maybe you could just rank orders them in terms of where you think the greatest profit opportunity upside might be; is it the seamless inventory or the more responsive supply chain? And over the next sort of year or 2, do you think you've got an opportunity to further lower your average unit cost or are you sort of seeing some stabilization there with, perhaps, some wage pressure creep into either late 2013 or 2014 costs?","Glenn K. Murphy","If -- I guess, there's 2 parts to it. If I focus exclusively on average unit cost, the opportunity clearly for us is to use less fabrics in the business and have people -- our vendors are becoming more and more sophisticated. And they're spending money on equipment. And they're able to take a fabric now and do multiple things through washing it and treating it that they couldn't have done 5 years ago. So I think that having fewer fabrics inside each one of our brands and committing for a longer period of time, let's call it, for a year or more to that fabric, I think, still gives our designers and our merchants huge flexibility to do the right thing on product. We're not going to sacrifice anything for efficiency to not give them the ability to do the right products in all the categories I talked about earlier. But I think it's clear to us now that we can reduce that, give our sourcing team an ability to go work with the mills, by having less fabrics and going for longer commitments. So I think there's value in that to be unlocked inside the company. Whether that value can offset wage pressures and everything else that's going on in everybody's supply chain, that's to be determined. I'm just happy that, as I stated probably 5 years ago, I'm just happy we still have lots of opportunities to improve the business from either from a cost perspective or from an earnings perspective, because what I'm identifying here from an AUC is something that we do today, we just don't do it as much as we should. And the company has always had lots of priorities; the great thing about Gap Inc. is we're rich with opportunities. And this is this is just one we talked about before that I believe we can do a lot more with this, and our vendors agree and I was -- I know this. I was with all of them. I spent 10 days in March in Korea and China and India. So, speaking to them about how much more we can do, explain to them our plan, trying to quantify the value of that. So our team is working aggressively to get that 1 component done. On your first question, it's tough to rank them, Kimberly. What I'd say, there's 3 opportunities we spoke about our Investor Meeting in April. I apologize to anybody on the phone who wasn't there. But we talked about the omni-channel opportunity, which I think there's value unlock in it for sure. And we're pretty far ahead and there's lots of components to the omni-channel that should generate real value. The value I'm looking for is on the sales line and then the market share opportunity and then as the 2 I just talked to John, so ranking them is difficult. I think all 3 have contribution and value to be unlocked between the 3 of them. And the only thing I would add to it is not much difference between the 3. So there isn't that one is worth a lot and the other one is just a marketing term that we're using because we want to look like we have opportunities. All 3 have opportunities and value to be unlocked. And I'll just say they're all equal for now until we actually get them in place and get a read from our customers and see what it can generate in terms of earnings, incremental earnings for the company. So we're fortunate to have all 3 of those opportunities available to us.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So essentially I have one question. You talked about 27% online growth, and that really is outstanding, particularly given the size of the overall business. And I was just wondering if you can drill into that a little bit more. How should we think about that growth rate being representative of the omni-channel investments that you've been making relative to maybe more traditional e-commerce traffic and growth drivers? And then you also touched upon China e-commerce growth in other regions. How does your omni-channel capabilities set you apart from your competitors in these other regions, these International regions?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Matt, I'll just start and then I'll turn it over to Glenn. But just as a reminder, on all of our sales in the first quarter, including our online sales, and we are really proud of the underlying growth. But it definitely benefited from the calendar shift. So we talked quite a bit, and I said it again that this first quarter dropped off a small February and added to May. So all of our sales, including online, benefited from that. And now I'll turn it over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","The only thing I'd add to that, Matt, is while I think it's easy to go to the omni-channel number -- sorry, the omni-channel initiative than point to the online number, and there's some truth to that. It's still early days for us, and I'm not going to -- I probably don't want to have too many baseball analogies today, but it's still early, but there are some contribution. As Sabrina said, it was calendar shift and probably a little bit of omni-channel, but the underlying business has been healthy for a long time. And we've been gaining market share online for a number of years. That continued in this quarter. I think when we think about it when -- we're going to have to figure out how to help you and the other people on the phone identify the value of omni-channel, but one of the big unlocks is obviously, as more and more people experience the brand through online and our traffic becomes, at some point, I can see these come in sooner rather than later, where more traffic begins online than actually go -- than starts in the store. Then with the different components of omni-channel, a big part of this is getting people to experience the brand, but get them into the store. So that won't show up in the online number. It should show up in the traffic number. It should show up in the generation of earnings from a 4-wall contribution. So while the early parts of omni-channel are helping a little bit on the online and more to come, the big win that I'm waiting for is getting people, who are more comfortable starting online, to experience the brand, be inspired by what they see and then get them into the store.","Internationally, if we had what we don't have today. But there's obviously, a roadmap we've put together of when can the North American components of the omni-channel make their internationally, certainly in a market like Japan and China, that would be -- that would be leading-edge. I think a lot of the omni-channel work and I travel around the world a lot, seems to be coming out of North America, particularly United States. In Europe, we'd like to get it in there. There are some very good retailers in Europe and they're very innovative. And I think some of the -- they're already advanced in some of these areas, not necessarily in our sector, but in some other sectors. So I think that the sooner we can get some parts of our omni-channel total package into the European business, I think that will help our European brands compete and also allow them to gain some market share.","Operator","And we'll go next to Oliver Chen with Citi.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding, Glenn, your comments on the customer sound quite encouraging. What gives you that conviction? I feel like in this conference call we've been hearing mixed signals in terms of caution from other management teams and volatility in the marketplace. And secondly, could you comment on looking forward for Old Navy? Some of the comp last year was driven more by units. And what do you think about going forward for the opportunity to comp there on the unit versus AUR side?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, look, we don't have more of a crystal ball than anybody else. And what I tried to quantify on the phone is that the environment is never going to go back to the way it was in 2006 and 2007. At least we don't see that anytime soon. We wish. But I did find this first quarter and we have our own research we do but obviously, we talk to customers a lot, we get feedback. And when you couple that with good macroeconomic tailwinds, which are starting to develop, whether that's on the job front, it may not satisfy a lot of people, but it's still good to see, whether that is in people's wealth, that's tied up in their homes or in their 401(k)s, I think all those things are positive signs. And so we're certainly not predicting that the consumer sentiment levels that were in place 6 or 7 years ago are going to return anytime soon. But we don't -- we look at a number of different metrics, but one that I'm particularly, as I've studied it for a long time, a fan of is the Reuters\/University of Michigan survey that comes out. And I think that consumer sentiment has been moving nicely in the right direction for the last 12 months. It's still a long way from its peak, but I think we're comforted by the direction it's taken. And so I think that that's good news.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, and on the Old Navy piece, Oliver, it's a good point. Last year when we were lapping 2011's high average unit cost, when the average unit cost came down, especially for Old Navy, because we had pulled so many units out in '11, we were putting them back in, in '12. So a lot of our comp was driven by that reinfusion of units, but really just to get it back to a normalized level. So I would say at this point going forward, we're sort of at a position where AUC is stable. It's not a big story, either up or down. So we will be managing the business in a more normalized fashion, which is to say we need to drive our comps with some increase in unit sales, but with the healthiest AURs we can achieve to meet our goal of delivering that comp growth with healthy margins.","Operator","We'll go next to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","I wanted to ask, Sabrina, if you could kind of let us know what your AUC benefit might be in the second quarter versus last year. And Glenn, given your discussion around the brand strength and the sourcing opportunities, I was wondering how you felt about the promotional levels at Gap and Old Navy in the first quarter and if we could expect any change there, in light of how you're feeling about the consumer confidence.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, so with regard to AUC, Janet, what we did say was that the first quarter is really the last quarter, where we get the tailwind from all of the movement up and then down on average unit costs that happened in '11 and '12. And from this point forward, the AUC is really sort of a nonissue. So the delta in AUC in the remaining quarters is not a meaningful change from the prior year. And then I'll just start off on your promotion question and let Glenn finish. Certainly, this year, it has been well documented on all the earnings calls before us, certainly this year versus last year, given the weather patterns in February and March, this year was less favorable for retailers overall in general, just given this weather pattern. So for the quarter, across-the-board, we were probably more promotional than we were in 2012. But that said, I think we're very pleased and you can see it in our merch [ph] margin performance and our overall performance. We're pleased with how the teams managed those promotions very surgically. So we were still able to deliver on our goal of getting that comp up with nice margins.","Glenn K. Murphy","And when we think of the 2 brands that you mentioned, Janet, look, at the end of the day, Old Navy is a brand in the value sector. So I'm -- I think that as long as long as they're being creative and innovative and in a lot of ways aggressive, that's what Old Navy needs to do, given that -- as we talked about at the Investor Conference that market share for us in North America is really one of our top priorities. I don't want excessive promotions at Old Navy. I don't want ideas tripping over one another, so consumer gets confused. But if they come out on big weekends, like we have this weekend, and go on and dominate and show strength and drive incremental traffic into their business and gain market share, then I think Stefan and his team are doing the right thing. And as long -- for Old Navy, to me, it's always the voice. It has a personality. And if they're just going to be 40% off on Memorial Day weekend, then I expect more from Old Navy to really come out and present its story and what the brand stands for. So I encourage them to be aggressive because that's what -- that's why it's a member of the portfolio because it's in the value sector and its aggressiveness is one of its traits. At Gap, well, I completely agree with what Sabrina said in the first quarter. I think that we put some more marketing into that business. We're feeling better about our product. We've put some money into stores in some of the key cities around the U.S., in San Francisco and -- sorry, and New York and Toronto, in Chicago. So we're actually expecting that as they continue to improve upon their product, their assortment strategy, the marketing continues to be driven strongly in the back half of the year. I don't feel good sometimes about our promotional level at Gap. I mean, that's an iconic brand. And yes, you need to talk about your value proposition. But that doesn't mean they're going to be void of promotions. That's just the world in which we operate. But I think that I would expect that as long as those 3 other components I spoke about earlier continue to strengthen and get better, that their need as their brand health and their relevance in the marketplace grows and it is growing, from the research we have, that they would have to be less dependent on some of the promotional decisions we have made in the past and find a better balance.","Operator","And we'll go next to Adrienne Tennant with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Glenn, your unit normalization strategy, obviously, has been very successful at Old Navy. I was wondering what, if anything, would make you consider possibly building units at the Gap brand? And then for Sabrina, a clarification question. The $2.52 to $2.60, does that exclude the $0.04 benefit? And when you said that it comes out of the fourth quarter, is that the $0.08 shift?","Sabrina L. Simmons","So why don't I start with both of them quickly and then Glenn can follow up? On the units, just to be clear, our unit -- our goal, Adrienne, is as we're driving comps to balance units with AUR. So I will tell you unit sales across the board for Gap Inc. were up because I don't want to leave you with the impression that we're pulling units out of Gap brand, that's not true. We're actually marching to that same balance. So we are increasing units to Gap Inc. across-the-board, and no brand is a standout in that. So everybody is kind of up in managing their AUR. With regard to the guidance, so the way to think about that is there's $0.04 of tax benefits, $0.02 are in the rate. And the rate piece is really just a timing difference because the full year rate is still 39%. But the $0.02 that came into interest, that is a onetime benefit that does flow through, but the range is an $0.08 range, and there's lots of pluses and minuses. So just as it's legitimate to bring that $0.02 from the interest on tax through, there's other offsetting items happening as well, and I called out one of them, which is the yen. So with the yen moving, I kind of think of them together like one is going up, the other one is hurting us. We'll see the degree to which it does. Does that answer your question?","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","That's super helpful. That absolutely answered it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, Glenn, a question on the marketing side of the business. I know you guys don't give guidance on what you're planning in terms of dollar growth or anything like that. But just when you look out to the remainder of the year, by brand, where do you see the most investment? And are you doing -- planning on doing new things, especially around the holidays?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, it's a little early to tell. We're just finishing up the holiday product story line and the assortment strategy from the team. But we -- I think Sabrina and I have been very consistent on marketing. We feel that with the additional marketing we gave and allowed our brands to use in 2012, mostly at Gap brand, where we put some money out of home and focused on our top 10 DMAs and we got some benefit from that. That's why we didn't pull it back in 2013. We didn't add to it, but we didn't pull it back. So we saw some benefit from the Be Bright campaign and that was resonating with people. So I think that we've always felt there's an ample amount of marketing for our brands to differentiate themselves because our story line has always been that Gap Inc. is a portfolio owner of 6 American brands. And we don't run stores. Therefore, there's always a need for some marketing to be able to make sure that people understand what Old Navy and our Gap and Banana Republic and our other brands stand for, what differentiates them, how they are going to win. So the marketing is a key part of that, beyond just what it can do for traffic. There's a story. And I'm feeling better about some of the stories coming out from the team. But the money and the investment, I'm actually -- I don't see a need to put much more money into the brand. So brand presidents want to make their own decisions, and we will guide them, and we will advise them. But I think they are also content and have come to a place that they realized they have more than enough money. The challenge from us is, are they putting it through the right channels? Are they putting it through right mediums? Are we getting the right mix? I'd like to see us do more and more on the social side. I think we've done quite a bit. I'd like to see us do more. And there are certain points that we're bringing forward and some data that we're sharing with them in order for them to make the right decisions. But so far, no need for more money. And we've never taken anything off the table. If Gap wanted to do anything different from holiday -- if all of a sudden, they thought television made sense, which I'm not saying it does or they're even contemplating that, as long as it's within the total budget that we've agreed to and they want to do something else, that's their decision to present to us. But right now, I don't see it much different from 2013 in terms of the playbook besides the creative is going to be different and the story is going to be different.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, and just to be a little helpful, Q1 was up $4 million. Q2, as Glenn said, in spirit, there's no huge change in plan, but we're certainly not planning on bringing it down in Q2. So directionally, he was talking about Q1 and Q2.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is around the operating margin expansion potential for the rest of the year. What comp do you need to leverage your fixed expenses, and then where do you see some of the bigger opportunities for gross margin expansion going forward?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. So on the leverage, Lorraine, because about half of our total expense base is related to stores. And over that, half of that this variable to sales, the way we think about it is we will manage our expenses in order to leverage our expense base. Because we have that much that is variable, so it's quite natural that we could use the levers to deliver that while still investing in our business, which is why we say you should expect, in nominal dollars, expenses to increase if we're increasing revenue, but we're always watching for that leverage. So we sort of reverse engineered it, if you will, to make sure we can deliver that. And with regard to the margin rate, we -- Glenn talked about the levers that we still have opportunities to, with the great product assortments with opportunities that are -- will be coming in the future around seamless inventory, et cetera. We are always looking to improve our profile with regard to regular price selling, the depth of our promotions, the depth of our markdowns. So that's obviously a very important lever. And then on the gross margin line, of course, we want to be leveraging our rent and occupancy, which we feel confident we can do on a positive comp.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Glenn, I think I'm going to take you back to a baseball analogy. You referred to this a little bit. I think it was in response to Janet's question. We're do you guys stand in terms of putting money back into the stores and maybe increasing some the store payroll and the kind of help there? I think you still maybe have an opportunity there. The merchandise looks good, but some of the stores maybe aren't running quite up to the level they should be. And then Sabrina, thanks for the clarification around the calendar shift. That was really helpful. Just wondering how we should think about the second quarter and the third quarter. I know the shift won't be as big, but will you see a little shift between there?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I've been doing this for a long time. And what I know is that, unfortunately, at any given day, something can go bump in the night in the store. And the conditions and the standards, the service, can be below our expectations. What I will tell you is that 2 things: one, we start to put more money back into our business in last year's P&L. As we became a little more comfortable with products and as the teams decided that there was a service model -- sorry, yes, customer service model opportunity. What I think they've done a really good job of is recognizing that if you have a fleet of 1,000, when it comes to Old Navy, you have a fleet of 700 stores when it comes to GAAP, that there are certain stores where we can actually get a return for that investment. So they've been much more thoughtful on what stores, where does the investment need to go? So in Banana Republic's case, the return is in the fitting room. In Old Navy's case, you put more labor and that's in replenishment. In Gap's case, you put more labor into their business, it's on the floor and actually engaging with customers. So we understand our brands very well. We know what our customers want and we know where labor, at times, needs to go because we've had either tested it or we just understand our business well enough, what kind of return we get. I'm disappointed, obviously, you're telling me in a backhanded way that you've been in some stores lately and have liked the product, but didn't like either the conditions of the store or the service level. And maybe you can tell Katrina where that was, we're happy to look into it because we want to run a good business every single day. And I know we just had our field conference here in San Francisco with our store managers and really got them not only motivated and pumped up about the opportunities going forward, but they understand the role they need to play in the business to run great customer service every single day. Now we track it. Just happened to have board [ph] meeting this week. Our scores are up again. We've had good scores. With that said, Jennifer, my theory on retail is you're only as good as your weakest link. And if we have a single store in the chain that is not running a good business on a given day, that hurts the overall brand, and I know our field leaders understand that. So I think the money is there, and maybe that was just poor execution, which is not acceptable from the way we look at our business.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. And then with regards to Q2 and Q3, our biggest notable shift due to the calendar are absolutely in Q1 and Q4, as we've noted. I've heard people talk about Q2 and Q3. And we're really not seeing any meaningful impact from the shift in those 2 quarters. I think part of the reason may be that unlike some of our competitors, we have 6 brands, many of which don't play in back-to-school. Obviously, Old Navy does, they are the biggest and Gap some, too. But I think with the 6 brands and the fact that we're probably also much more geographically dispersed than some of the competitors that are talking about the Q2, Q3 piece may be the reasons. So for us, it's Q1 and Q4 and very little in Q2 and Q3.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Great. And Glenn, that wasn't a backhanded comment. It was just -- I think that maybe you still have an opportunity to do a little better. But as you said, with a big store base, it's kind of difficult.","Operator","And we'll go next to Randy Konik with Jefferies & Company.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So the story we have been trying to tell is the story of transformation and sustainability. So when you think about the ability to obviously comp on top of comps and get revenue acceleration after the company has been in a kind of flat revenue environment for about 1 decade, how do you tell the market out there how you believe in the sustainability of -- from a revenue growth perspective? How we should we be thinking of that type of theme?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, look, the reason I mentioned it on the opening comments is only because I think that was written about by most people that, that was a metric that analysts and some investors will be looking for, coming off an impressive and strong Q1 in 2012. So the fact that we backed that 4% comp up with a 2% comp is nothing that we're surprised about. It's something we're planning to do. And as Sabrina said in her comments, we are looking to have a business that comps. And as I said at the investor conference, we are going to gain market share. And Randy, so that's a -- it's a short question that can take a long, long time to answer. And it really adds up to all the different ingredients that I think we put forward. But what I would say is that in 2010, which was the -- a year that had, not the consumer sentiment we're seeing in 2013, but it was coming out of a very difficult 2008, 2009, the business had a very nice comp, good top line and had record operating margins. And that was the beginning of what the business -- with the talent we have, the strategies and the hand we have to play, that was a really a turning moment for us. We started feeling the confidence. And of course, the cotton events of 2011 happened and we get we got distracted. And then we have had a good year in 2012. So we look at it and go, okay, well, you can explain 2008, 2009. Most retailers struggled in those 2 years that have kind of heavy base rooted in the United States or in Canada. 2010, when conditions were slightly better, we did very well. 2011, I just explained. 2012, conditions were more normalized. We did well. Q1 2013, conditions are more normalized. We do well. So I think that we're a team that's been through all of the different tests that you need to put a team through, whether that's macro tests, restructuring tests, bringing new people in to an organization, embracing change, cultural or physical change, as we've gone into China and other markets. This business and the leadership has proven to be incredibly resilient. So we're not trying to say that this is any prediction going forward. But I think 2012, now into '13, as I mentioned, in my consumer comments, we feel that the consumer is slightly getting better. And now it's up to people to look at, as Jennifer was saying, by going to more stores and seeing the products that I think that the team is starting to put back-to-back-to-back performance together with a lot more opportunity to come, back to Janet's question on the operating lever and the changes to operating model, which provide even greater efficiency and the value to be unlocked. So look, we understand what we have to get done. It's a very competitive market. There's a lot of people in our business. But our portfolio strategy that takes us the value luxury in North America and our International growth opportunity, I think you put that together and there's lots more we can do here at Gap Inc.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll go to Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Guys, just curious if you've hind sighted or done a survey work regarding where did you lose your customer to over the last couple of years? And sort of what are they telling you now regarding where they're coming from? And are you measuring both conversion and traffic to try to gauge how you're doing on that trend?","Glenn K. Murphy","Brian, we have more data than you can imagine here. But it's -- I think the best information we have is just we talked to existing customers. We have a very strong existing base, who, I think, with the struggle with them when maybe our business was not as strong as we like it to be was frequency. We had them coming in with just frequency. Then we have a strong base of lapsed customers, people who don't come in for an extended period of time and we know how to speak to them and obviously get them back engaged with the brand. They still feel very strongly. And this is just at a very high level. But any one of our brands, any lapsed customer felt good about the brand, didn't for a reason find -- didn't have a reason to come in for an extended period of time. Now we're speaking to them more often in 2012 and continued in 2013. What I would say is back to the opportunities available to Gap Inc. are the number of new customers we need to get into our business and people who maybe have never experienced the brand, maybe they've just come in of that age when it makes sense or we had a period of time where we were not as strong as we should've been, not as relevant from a product, from a marketing, from a store perspective and maybe they -- we just skipped a period of time where people were not coming in with the natural curiosity you get with mall shoppers. So I think that that's the work I'm certainly encouraging our brand presidents is, you got to strengthen your strengths with your loyal customers, there's an opportunity with lapsed. I think some work has started on that front and I'm very engaged with them under this new customers who we have more to offer, more to speak with them about and we have focus groups, when we get new customers together and take them through our business, take them through our product. They get engaged. I mean, it's -- the response is definitely there. They know of the brand. It's just not a brand under consideration list and we need to be on everybody's consideration list. So I think there's some work going on that front, but more to come. I think it's just early days on the new customer front.","Katrina O'Connell","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.

Welcome to Gap Inc.'s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.","For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we are required to compare to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's earnings press release, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com.","These forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 20, 2015, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining us on the call today are CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons. Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investor Relations section at gapinc.com.","With that I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Art Peck","Thanks, Jack. Pleased to be here today, pleased to be talking to you. Sabrina will take you through the first half and Q2. I\u2019m really going to focus on the back half of the year and as we get into 2016, we are making progress on the journey that I\u2019ve articulated to you in the work that\u2019s going on at Gap and at Banana Republic.","Let me start with Old Navy and then I\u2019ll talk about the other brands as well. Pleased with Old Navy\u2019s performance, I see strength as I look into the back half. Obviously, we look at all the products as we go through the months and very pleased with where the women\u2019s business is, as well as the other businesses that surround women\u2019s at the end of the day.","Active has been a strength that they continue to build. We now have an active expression that sits across the entire family. As I look out into September and October, I think the fall product for Old Navy is going to be right in the sweet spot of what\u2019s on brand, on trend, and a great value proposition and I\u2019m excited about what they can do for this company in the back half.","Old Navy\u2019s consistency continues to be a thing of beauty. It sits on a platform of product process that they have built over the last couple of years and now are pretty relentlessly executing season after season. It\u2019s those same product processes that we are pretty follow-on in installing in Gap and Banana Republic and as I\u2019ve said before, Old Navy remains our proof point for building products, executing trend, delivering on brand, on quality, on fit product consistency for the rest of the company.","We see a very long member of growth for Old Navy. They\u2019ve gained roughly $1 billion of market share over the course of the last three years. They are continuing to build out their response to supply chain capabilities, platforming fabric, becoming faster and faster in responding to consumer needs and I\u2019m very pleased with the progress that Stefan and the team have made and the outlook that we see for the back half and 2016.","Let me then turned to Gap. The steps that I have laid out with Jeff as we\u2019ve focused on getting the business back on track. First of all, obviously, started with recruiting the team around Jeff. And that is now largely done. Since I spoke to you last, Stephen Sare has joined us as head of global merchandising. Stephen is a talent and we\u2019re very pleased to have him. The team has been focused obviously on spring of 2016 and I\u2019m confident that they have been doing the right work to get the business back on track as we get into next year.","Three weeks ago, I was in New York with the entire team. We did a full style level on figure review of the adult assortments. I saw terrific progress in terms of re-centering on what the brand equities are. On fit, on quality, on feminine way, on optimism, they are hallmarks of what Gap brands is all about. I\u2019m not going to stand up at the plate and call which fence we\u2019re going to hit it over, that\u2019s not who I am, but I am confident that Gap will make significant progress in spring and very pleased with what I\u2019ve seen in the women\u2019s assortment and the turnaround in the women\u2019s assortment.","While being focused on getting the spring women\u2019s assortment back on track, which the team has been spending most of their energy on and they\u2019ve now obviously turned to summer. At the same time they\u2019ve been rebuilding the product processes inside the business and I\u2019ve referred to this before, using Old Navy as the template built more responsive capabilities, platformed much of the fabric, and I\u2019m very encouraged by what these capabilities will be able to deliver for us as we get into 2016.","For the first time, we will be going to in season open in some of our key product programs and therefore able to get back in after we read the business in season with significant quantities of units. This is obviously an important capability for us. We are building this across the entire company and its great to see Jeff and the team make progress like this as quickly as they have.","Let me for a moment just address the strategic actions that we announced we were going to be taking when we last spoke with you. I\u2019m really pleased with the progress that Jeff and the team have made. We will have stores being closed over the course of this year, but the work on restructuring the business, on working with our landlords to make sure that this was an orderly process has largely been done, and what that does is it gives the team the ability to really now focus on the business going forward.","Let me turn for just a moment to Banana Republic. It\u2019s not a place where I\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking to in our last couple of calls. So, I want to spend a moment there and give you my perspective as to what we\u2019re looking at in the back half and as we get into 2016. I\u2019m really confident with the design point of view that we have in the business. I feel like the team underneath Marissa is really centered on the aesthetic of the brand, really in the sweet spot of what Banana is and should be. And I\u2019m confident that we have a significant opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year and next year to really drive the business to merchandising as well.","I feel like we can support our big ideas and there are several on the pipeline and by the line and way they can buy the business, I\u2019m really excited to see what this brand can do as we get to the end of the year and into 2016.","Let me turn last to China. And obviously over the last, even couple of weeks there has been a lot of news coming out of China and it\u2019s an important area of long-term growth for us. I was in China just a few weeks ago, spent a week with the team in stores, in several cities, and quite simply I and we are continuing to be very bullish on our opportunity in China. We will process the currency devaluation, and the team is working on that right now. I don\u2019t see that really giving us any significant headwinds as we think about the continued growth of the China business.","We continue to look at a very robust store pipeline there as well. Our outlook business continues to grow in China and so really as far as I\u2019m concerned no change in strategy, no change in direction, no change in intensity as we continue to look at China as a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company.","So before I close, I would just like to address the fact that there is a lot of noise really out there right now around the apparel sector. And just so you know my perspective, I shut it out because from where I sit across all of our businesses, our job is to deliver regardless of the noise that\u2019s out there today and what I see is, I see a consumer who has confidence, I see dollars being spent and I see an opportunity for us to continue to get more than our fair share, as I look forward and I am very optimistic given the work that\u2019s going on inside of Gap and Banana and the continued consistency that I see in old Navy, very optimistic about what I see in front of us. Now, let me turn it over to Sabrina.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you Art. Good afternoon everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues, and our previously announced strategic actions, primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting financial results I\u2019m going to zoom out and quickly speak to our first half results on a normalized basis.","Beginning with foreign exchange, in the first half, foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.06. With the accelerated weakening of the Yen and Canadian dollar the FX impact of $0.04 to Q2 was larger than Q1. With regard to the West Coast port situation, the first half impact of the port delays was about $0.13 in-line with our original estimate, but slightly weighted towards Q2.","And finally the charges associated with the strategic actions, which were publicly disclosed in mid June totaled about $95 million in the first half or about $0.14. As a reminder, these charges primarily include costs associated with lease buyouts, asset impairments, and employee-related costs. Excluding these items our underlying business delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% over last year. We\u2019re pleased that despite our product challenges at Gap and Banana Republic, we were able to use all of our levers to achieve this respectable underlying earnings per share growth in the first half. ","Turning now to the second quarter performance, on a constant currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the second quarter. As reported net sales were $3.9 billion, down 2% versus last year. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release.","Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points to 37.4%. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 40 basis points. Merchandise margin deleveraged 160 basis points and was negatively impacted by both the ports and foreign exchange.","With regard to SG&A, we continue to manage expenses tightly. Second quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion including about $70 million of charges associated with our strategic actions and about $30 million benefit from foreign exchange. Excluding these items and last year\u2019s gain on sale, adjusted SG&A dollars were about flat year-over-year. Marketing expenses were down $11 million to $131 million.","Turning to earnings, excluding the negative impact from strategic actions which was about $0.12, earnings per share were $0.64 or $0.52 on a reported basis. Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars per store were up 1% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our guidance. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $341 million. Consistent with our opportunistic approach, we are pleased to have spent over $600 million on share repurchases year-to-date. In the second quarter alone, we spent over $375 million repurchasing 10 million shares. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled about $800 million. We ended the quarter with a share count of $410 million and a cash balance of $1 billion.","Regarding capital expenditures and store count, year-to-date capital expenditures were about $300 million. On a net basis, we opened 29 company operated stores year-to-date including 40 Gap brand closures. We ended the quarter with 3,309 stores.","And now, I\u2019d like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Given that our first half performance was within the scenarios embedded in our initial full year outlook, we are affirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. This range excludes the charges associated with our strategic actions. With regard to those actions, we now estimate the charges to be around $130 million to $140 million. Excluding the cost associated with our strategic actions, we continue to expect operating margins to be down about 1% versus 2014 driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange, the first half port issues and last year\u2019s gain on sale.","While we continue to pursue our growth initiatives in Asia and domestically with Athleta given our Gap brand closures, we now anticipate store count and square footage to be about flat for the year. Regarding inventory, we expect third quarter inventory to be down slightly. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.","In closing, while the business experienced challenges in the first half, we are pleased to have delivered underlying EPS growth of 12% and to have distributed about $800 million to shareholders underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash. As we enter the third quarter, we\u2019ll continue to focus on leverage that we can control and advance the initiatives that will drive future improvements.","Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jack.","Jack Calandra","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up to questions. We\u2019d appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva","Great. Thanks so much and thanks for taking our question. A question on Old Navy, this division has demonstrated for some time now some very strong top line and bottom line momentum. As we approach the tougher comparisons in the fourth quarter especially, can you maybe talk about the trade-off between your AUR and transactions to drive positive comps and specifically what categories are you particularly excited for holiday? Thanks so much.","Art Peck","Thanks, Anna, and thanks for the question. I know that we are looking at those tougher comps. Again, I would point out that we\u2019ve got three years under our belt with the business and that\u2019s a function of how we\u2019re bringing product to market as we pointed out several times. Even if I look across the business, the women\u2019s business is performing, I\u2019ve now seen product looking out through the rest of the year, really excited about where we are from a trend standpoint across a number of categories, and that\u2019s probably what\u2019s most important to me is that the strength of the business has diversified. It\u2019s not singular and then if you add on top of that, some new categories that really have not been powering the business until we\u2019ve built them out over the last couple of seasons like active, I feel really good about what it\u2019ll maybe has as ammunition to deliver the back half.","Sabrina Simmons","The only thing I\u2019ll add with regard to sort of our levers is, hopefully we\u2019ve done a nice job for the other part of the year in participating in a promotional environment while still delivering high quality margins. And we intend to continue that into the back half. So AUR will be an important lever as we continue to manage inventory responsibly and prudently there.","Operator","And we will go next to Matthew Boss of JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Hi, good afternoon. So as we think about SG&A, you\u2019ve trimmed roughly a $150 million of expenses from the base over the past two years. My question, what kind of flexibility remains if sales were to remain constrained? And then on the balance sheet, what\u2019s the adjusted leverage ratio or debt-to-EBITDA you\u2019re comfortable with going forward and just the minimum cash balance to fund the business?","Sabrina Simmons","Great question. So starting with expenses, I mean we like to think Matthew that our work is never over. There is always opportunity to work more productively and efficiently in the business. As a reminder, large part of our expense base is variable to sales whether it\u2019s per unit because of DC cost or whether it\u2019s related and variable to store cost, a large piece is variable. So of course when sales are increasing, we would expect nominal dollars to increase but if they are not increasing, then we do our very best as we\u2019ve been demonstrating to be responsible and to hold all of our other discretionary and overhead items very tightly combined with the natural benefit we get from the variable piece. So that\u2019s that piece.","With regard to the balance sheet, let me see if I can remember your questions, I know one was on cash. And so we still target roughly between $1 billion and $1.2 billion as our cash on balance sheet target, and we ended with $1 billion so we are very comfortable with where we ended the quarter. And then with regard to our ratios, I would say broadly speaking we like being an investment grade credit. It gives us a lot of flexibility in our business and we have fought hard for those, so we try to remain consistent in our ratios with the agencies guidelines on what constitutes investment grade.","Matthew Boss","Okay, great. That was really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Just a quick clarification question for Sabrina if I can, what\u2019s the first half EPS of the $2.75 to $2.80 is based off? Is that the $1.42 underlying and then just assuming content share count, does that just imply the back half EPS is around $1.33 and $1.38?","Sabrina Simmons","The $2.75 to $2.80 guidance assumes our reported EPS excluding the GAAP \u2013 mostly GAAP charges that we described since June 15. The foreign exchange is embedded and the port is embedded, so it includes everything expect for those strategic action charges as outlined on June 15. Is that helpful Simeon?","Simeon Siegel","Is that the $1.42 or is it a piece of the $1.42? What\u2019s the underlying number?","Sabrina Simmons","The $1.42 excludes all of the components. So again the $2.75 would include the foreign exchange which is $0.06 and it would include the port of $0.13. So it wouldn\u2019t be the $1.42 if we adjusted for those $0.19. ","Simeon Siegel","Perfect. Great, thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","Sure.","Operator","And we will go next to Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Chen","Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering Art if you can talk a little bit more about the in-season open program that you mentioned earlier. It sounds like an exciting opportunity for the team to get a chance to read and react, and also be able to chase into better selling items. What percentage of the collection will be part of that program and is it in all brands that you mentioned and so any additional color would be helpful. Thanks.","Art Peck","Yes. I\u2019m not going to give you specific numbers here because we\u2019re actually still a ways out and we are obviously trying to build this as quickly as we can and use it as quickly as we can. And remember what I referred to here was that, Gap would be for the first time in a significant way using this capability. The way we were thinking about it, Betty, is against key programs. You know this is a business that\u2019s where we manage it around the top 30 mentality of our key styles and so using in key programs, and we\u2019re going to roll it quickly and it\u2019s based upon a combination of obviously reading the business, having open to buy, having platform fabric adds vendors who are capable on this integrated basis of cutting, washing, dying etc and proximate sourcing. And so there will be more to say about this, but it does involve putting products in our stores, testing and then responding in season and I\u2019m really excited about it.","Betty Chen","And Art, does that go live for the spring season or more so the second half of 2016?","Art Peck","In spring, we\u2019ll be going in with the capability applied in a couple of places in the business.","Betty Chen","Great. Thank you so much. Best of luck.","Art Peck","Yes.","Operator","And we will go next to Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner","Thanks and good afternoon everyone. Wondered on the Gap, if you could talk a bit about the bottoms business, that\u2019s certainly been a mainstay and we are talking about somewhat of a resurgence in Denim overall in the industry in the back half of the year, and just wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you might benefit from that even with the rest of the assortment not necessarily where you want it to be at this point?","Art Peck","Yes. I said before and I\u2019ll just reiterate, we are pretty confident that the Denim cycle has hit bottom and it has been coming back over the last several months. You also note from where I said and I\u2019ve said it before. I'm a strong opponent of where buying mean as we go into season and obviously we did responsive capabilities and then getting the upside in the AUR. So we are seeing in Denim right now and it\u2019s for Gap in particular that\u2019s largely the bottoms business, especially past summer. We are seeing trend being indigo, trend being distracted, trend being patch and repair and then some variation in Lake shape and rise. We're buying responsibly into those in the back half and in spring 2016 as well. The other thing that I am really, really feeling good about to be quite honest is our fit. Fit should be an asset for this company and we have had fit challenges and consistency challenges in bottoms in Gap and it\u2019s something that the team has been very resolutely focused on and I\u2019m seeing some significant progress there. It\u2019s probably more of a spring where I\u2019m comfortable saying it\u2019s more of a spring issue that it really hits but it\u2019s definitely on the teams mind.","Dorothy Lakner","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. Art, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Banana. Some of the new designs hit in the April, May timeframe we haven\u2019t really seen the customer respond yet to that product. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks that you\u2019re confident in the design and the opportunity to drive the merchandising in the second half of 2015 and 2016. So I am wondering if you can help us with the changes or adjustments that are being made either within designer to the merchandising process that you think will lead to that improved trajectory, thank you so much.","Art Peck","And you know we had a new team come in lead by Andy, so the movement was underneath the team, including supplementing the design team underneath Marissa and some changes there and we have a team now that I\u2019m very confident, basically complete, the seats are full and the first thing they did was dig into back half product and look and see where they are right now. ","And there are some styles in the assortment as you can imagine, maybe which were better, but they really have their arms around the assortment architecture and have a buying in the business really into Q4 and then in the spring of 2016 and I\u2019m distorting my energy as you can imagine towards looking at the product that\u2019s in the pipeline; and so I\u2019m now seeing each seasonal collection as it\u2019s in concept and then in adoption and I\u2019m pleased and I know Andy is pleased and the team are pleased with how it\u2019s coming together. When I refer to the merchandising opportunity, obviously it\u2019s designing a collection that\u2019s commercial and then it\u2019s buying at with a point of view, and putting your dollars behind the big ideas are going to drive the business; and we\u2019ve been brought more flat over the last several seasons versus really distorting towards the point of view and that\u2019s something else that Andy is really focused on as we get later in the year and then 2016.","Operator","And we will go next to Susan Anderson with FBR and Company.","Susan Anderson","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. On the product front, just one question on that should we think about maybe some quality being added back into the product for spring next year too? And then on the store closures how should we think about the cadence going forward and if you have any thoughts may be around the sales retention that you guys think you can give may either to online or other stores out of those? Thank you.","Art Peck ","Yes. On quality, the answer is, it\u2019s been on everybody\u2019s list and what I don\u2019t want to do is say quality, the differ comes at a massive cost because those two things don\u2019t necessarily go hand in hand. We are focused on restoring quality in key places with business where it is relevant and perceptible and differentiated for the customer and so that\u2019s been a particular focus inside of Banana and a particular focus inside of Gap and it doesn\u2019t always come for free, but it doesn\u2019t always come with a cost either. And so you could easily choose a yarn in the sweater that\u2019s actually more expensive because of the hand field that it delivers, but it\u2019s a yarn that doesn\u2019t meet our pilling standards and therefore for the customer it\u2019s a lower quality experience and so this is only - on my radar I\u2019ve mentioned it before it\u2019s on the radar of the teams for both of those brands as well as Old Navy, the customer has a quality expectation that\u2019s an opportunity for us. And so should expect to see some of that in the back half of the year, but it\u2019s been are very intentional focus, a design merchandising production and sourcing as we get into the beginning of next year. On the store cadence, why don\u2019t I turn that over to Sabrina and she can talk a little bit and I can jump in if I need to.","Sabrina Simmons","Sure. On the store closures, we\u2019re pretty much on track with where we thought we would be. So, we closed about 30 Gap stores in the first half and our best estimate is we\u2019re still on target to close about 140 of the 175 North America specialty stores we talked about on June 15. So, everything pretty much is still on track there, but we will be updating you every quarter. With regard to the sales retention, we talked about $300 million of sales being associated with the store closures in total and we are pretty transparent that historically we haven\u2019t seen a lot of sales transfer within Gap brand. Now that said, we made a very large concerted effort this time to really, really go after the customer with some email pieces, direct mail pieces, fine edge in stores to try and recapture to the next closest Gap store, as well as online; and in addition to that many of these stores were in markets where there was an Old Navy nearby. And so the Old Navy team also focused and will continue to focus on recapturing some of the sales that are coming from the closed stores.","Susan Anderson","Great that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we will go next Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you, good afternoon. Sabrina could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about currency and the impact on next year, given the recent into moves in rates?","Sabrina Simmons","Sure. So at a high level as a reminder for our legal entities that do business outside of the United States and the biggest businesses I\u2019ll focus on again for us are Japan and Canada because those two together are really our biggest currency exposure because we have about $2 billion worth of sales between those two countries. Unfortunately those currencies have continued to depreciate. So we hedge of course those operations are in local currency and they buy the vast majority of their cost of goods in U.S. dollars. So they are exposed to the depreciation of their currency and we hedge for them 12 months to 18 months forward to give our merchants and our team certainty around what the cost of sales is, but also obviously it eases the impact of the depreciation of the currencies. Now, it doesn\u2019t prevent the depreciation of the currencies ultimately hitting us, it only delays it. So with a continuation of the depreciation of the Yen and CAD in particular, we are probably going to expect to see continuing headwinds into 2016. ","Now, currencies are really volatile, we will see when we get there and we\u2019ll talk more about that obviously in our Q4 call when we finish doing most of our hedging and we have our budget stand. But I would say from where we sit today given the way the currencies have moved, we\u2019re going to probably continue to feel headwinds maybe around the same magnitude hopefully not but maybe around the same magnitude as we have this year.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. Sabrina, I was just curious about your views on the merchandise margins for the back half in terms of the puts and takes, and I know that you\u2019re looking to see a better improvement for Gap division until next spring. And just briefly, what about your bigger picture view for Banana Republic in terms of the market position and the customer profile about where it could go versus where it is now? Thank you.","Sabrina Simmons","They are also with merch margins Oliver and we don\u2019t give hard guidance on merch margins, but to be helpful directionally what we are looking to do obviously is to continue to manage our inventory very tightly and you\u2019ve heard me say coming off of Q2 where we met our guidance and we were only up 1%, we are looking to come down now in Q3 slightly. So we just keep ratcheting the inventory to get tighter and tighter, and we feel that gives us a better probability of getting our average unit retail up and our margins up. We\u2019ll see where they actualize the key customer response. I think our short is probably better in Q4 given what are laid out with regard to Banana Republic and Gap modestly changing their assortments for holiday, not so much for fall. So that\u2019s what I give you to try to be helpful.","Art Peck","I\u2019ll just go \u2013 I would not spend a lot of time on this Oliver and happy to talk about this as well longer. I guess I have a model in my brain as I think about this business which is number one obviously the competition is extraordinarily fragmented. It\u2019s to me is a blessing because it means that everybody, there are many, many, many share gain opportunities for us. And then I think about the business in terms of pricing events across categories and the pricing events obviously range from extreme value to luxury and everything in between. If I look at the opportunity for Banana position where it is, where it\u2019s executing well, there is a very large opportunity for us there. And so I\u2019m pretty excited about the growth there as we get the business back on track and especially as we are building the product platforms underneath Banana to be more responsive and more quick and more on trend. So it\u2019s a place where we don\u2019t quite talk about it as much as we do certainly with Gap and the situation there and then obviously with the strength at Old Navy. But to me it is a quite powerful growth asset for this company.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","And we will go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon everyone. Can you talk a little bit about marketing? Marketing was down, what\u2019s the plan for holiday given that the new product will be fully up and running yet, and how do you see at both stores and what you\u2019re doing with omnichannel? Thank you.","Art Peck","Thanks, Dana.","Sabrina Simmons","I\u2019ll start Dana with Q2 and marketing was down driven primarily by Banana and then the absence of Piperlime and a little bit of Gap. For Q3, we\u2019ll probably expect it to be down again. I mean you guys might remember we had a fall campaign for Gap last year which were not anniversarying. So we are probably going to be down because of that loan and also the absence of Piperlime, no other dramatic changes and we might even invest a little more in other brands like Old Navy. And I would say it\u2019s probably a little early to talk about holiday because we haven\u2019t finished those plans, but I don\u2019t know Art if you want to add anything.","Art Peck","No. I mean I\u2019ll give a somewhat straight answer obviously but nonetheless I think when that I feel pretty strongly about which is the best marketing is good product. And if I look at Gap as an example, we drove the strong business back a couple of years ago in spring of 2012 with modest marketing but exceptional product. And so what I can say is that, as we feel better about the product that will help us think about the marketing that we\u2019re willing to put behind it. But I do believe that your marketing should lag good products and that a lot of what will drive the bounce in the business is good product in the stores which you then put some marketing behind in maybe in the next period. So we\u2019re managing it very carefully and again as Sabrina said, too soon to talk about what we\u2019re going to do in Q4, it\u2019s not really there yet.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes.","Operator","And we will go next to Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon. My question is on inventory. If you can help us out with inventory by division, if I recall last year when Old Navy was performing exceptionally well, there might have been a point in time when you see you had more inventory. So I was wondering as you go up into anniversary those compares that you might give it a little bit more feel so to speak? Thank you.","Sabrina Simmons","Directionally, Adrienne, I would tell you for sure Gap is going to be the tightest followed closely by Banana. Because of their performance year-to-date and because we have the most confidence behind Old Navy, we\u2019re going to be very tight with Gap and Banana. And then to your point, Old Navy, they\u2019re still managed with their sales level tightly, they\u2019re going to have more inventory for sure to see their momentum. But I think they\u2019re on to something really good and were all holding hands and we\u2019d like to see a little improvement in turn as we get forward. So I think across the board ties the directionally or maybe it\u2019s definitely going to be inventory better than Gap or BR. ","Adrienne Yih","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","And we will go next to Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess a question maybe talk Sabrina about the ROD leverage point maybe a little given the store closing announcements. I know you said that the China and international openings have raised that leverage point, but does this now enabled the business to get ROD leverage at a lower point or at least maybe into next year. And then maybe I know we are lapping last year\u2019s Gap slow down in the product side. How should we think about the categories you would expect to turn over time as you started in women\u2019s tops, you\u2019re seeing a little better trend in Denim, maybe just talk about the next couple of months here even what we should be seeing at the Gap division versus last year?","Sabrina Simmons","Starting with ROD, you are correct, Brian. We said that most recently, it will probably take a lot of mid single positive comp to leverage ROD for the reasons you laid out, more of a mix for to international and [indiscernible]. With regard to the impact of the store closures on ROD, I would say it\u2019s not going to be that meaningful and the reason is you\u2019ll recall that the stores were closing mostly in the lower quality centers. And in those centers, we actually had pretty favorable rent. So when we take those out of the portfolio, it doesn\u2019t really appear ROD leverage much because as a percent to rent. That wasn\u2019t the issue with those stores. It was more brand positioning with those stores.","Art Peck","And then if you just go to categories and I\u2019ll be consistent here and not call significant change in the business in the back half even though the team has been able to make some incremental changes as they looked at both fall and holiday. So if you look at Gap, where do I expect bounce as we\u2019re getting the aesthetic on trend, quality etc on track, you can just look at the public data and see where we\u2019ve given up market share. Knit is a big category in women\u2019s where we gave up market share. It is a niche cycle right now. It is an opportunity for us to get our share in more than our fair share. Denim is coming back which is a place that powers the brand and I believe we have really good product development in the pipeline, and those are two big categories for the brand, so as be brand drivers for Gap. And so I\u2019ll just stop there at the moment but that\u2019s \u2013 the team is obviously been focused across the entire assortment, but to be able to ride the bounce in Denim and then reclaim and sell our fair share in Knits is a big opportunity for us.","Jack Calandra","And Amber, we\u2019ve got time for one more question.","Operator","Yes. And we will go to Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe","Thank you very much. Two questions quickly. If you could just clarify the strategic charge in 1Q, I know it\u2019s $71 million in 2Q, was there any in 1Q? Am I mistaken in thinking there was?","Sabrina Simmons","No, you\u2019re right, Richard. It\u2019s a good call up. So just before, as we were building into the public announcement, we started taking some small actions in the first quarter related mostly to some inventory and related to the store closures. And when we gave our initial estimate on 6.15 [ph], it included a little bit of that action we had already taken in Q1 building into the announcement. So consistent with that, the number we just gave out for the first half has a little bit of spend in Q1 as once it was announced, we accumulated the total charges.","Richard Jaffe","So the $71 million doesn\u2019t include the amount of 1Q, but the $140 million does?","Sabrina Simmons","Correct.","Richard Jaffe","Great. And just a quick kind word on the franchise operation internationally.","Art Peck","Franchise operation continues to be a business that we believe grow strongly, obviously also some foreign exchange headwinds there which we don\u2019t call on separately but we are bullish on it and now we\u2019re really just starting to put Old Navy into the mix and so far the read on Old Navy in the Middle East and in the Philippines has been very positive for us. I don\u2019t want to go into a lot more detail right now, but it\u2019s a business that we are long term committed to and getting Old Navy in the mix is pretty powerful for us.","Jack Calandra","Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. For those analysts who wish to participate in a question-and-answer session after the presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participants. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O'Connell","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.","For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we're required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's press release, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 22, 2014, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Before we begin, I also want to mention that Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investor Relations section at gapinc.com. Joining us on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I hand the call over Sabrina who will take you through Gap, Inc.\u2019s first quarter financial performance, I thought I\u2019d give you my thoughts on Q1 and also remind everybody on the call of Gap, Inc.\u2019s four global priorities.","Everybody here was actually pretty disappointed in our earnings results for the quarter. We were below last year and that hasn\u2019t happened to us since the first quarter of 2011 and that was driven by the cotton crisis. So in spite of the fact that the operating conditions were challenging, especially in the first half of the quarter, I expect that we would do better.","Now upon reflection we have been doing this now for the last number of weeks, looking at the business because our business is all about continuous improvement and what we are going to do to move our business in the right direction.","The product was a little too spring forward and that\u2019s something that\u2019s in our control. I think our customer communications could have been better, that\u2019s also something in our control and our margin management I really thought the team could have done a better job working through inventory we had, especially as they backed up after the month of February and we could have done a better job managing our margins in the quarter as well. All three of those points are completely in our control in areas that the business has embraced and are making the necessary changes as we come into Q2.","With that said, I think we have pretty good plans across the business in the second quarter. We are in the business to gain share and our goal is gaining share in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter to finish the year strongly.","When I look at the business, Old Navy is the one brand that\u2019s furthest along. I think that they have made some really good decisions and that\u2019s evidenced by their performance in April which was a plus 18 comp and that\u2019s pretty strong.","They made some really good decisions on their assortment, that\u2019s rooted in fashion essentials and I like what I am seeing as they evolve and improve their assortment between now and the end of the year.","And when I think of their marketing going forward, I like what the team has done, they got a really good creative platform right now at Old Navy, I think its going to be -- even more compelling as we move through the year and more aggressive, and the Old Navy team is revamping their whole online site, which you will see next month. So I think their digital presence will be even stronger going forward.","Now Banana Republic, the good news in that business is that women\u2019s has turned the corner, seems like that\u2019s been a long journey, but we haven\u2019t gone in the right direction and customers will truly notice the difference in our August delivery and everybody in that team and myself are pretty excited about that.","Marissa Webb joined Banana Republics starting in the 1st of May. Now Marissa\u2019s impact on product is not going to be felt immediately, but seeing as how she is our creative director, who impact on our messaging and the voice to the customer, whether it\u2019s on social or in other tools we felt, around the same time as you see this lift and this improvement in our women\u2019s product in August.","Gap is definitely heading the right direction, but still has work to do. Steve and the team know that. What I\u2019m looking forward to with them is they are moving to full global assortment in August of this year, that's across the business. It's a complete change from where -- how we assort today and how we do that globally.","And I think that\u2019s going to really help their business go out and different themselves and gain share. And coincidently, with that, we will be the first campaign we are gone have globally from our new ad agency Wieden & Kennedy for Gap.","Now as I promised at the beginning of the call, I want to give you an update on Gap, Inc.\u2019s global priorities. They are global growth, omni-channel, responsive supply chain and seamless inventory.","I spent quite a bit of time at the recent Analyst Meeting explaining to everybody why we choose these initiatives and the value we are going to create for Gap, Inc. shareholders going forward as each one of these become part of how we operate every single day.","I feel good about the value creation and as you look at each one of them, the global growth initiative 250 new stores this year, that\u2019s a combination of corporate and franchise, that\u2019s a high watermark for us.","So far so good in China, still good performance, comp performance and new stores going into that marketplace, 20 new cities in 2014, Old Navy performance so far in the franchise market and Philippines has been very good, excited about what we are seeing in Shanghai with the first Old Navy store opening.","And early news is that in the last 30 days we have added five new Athleta stores to our planned list and our guidance, and now we are going to open 35 Athleta stores in 2014, which will allows us to end the year with 100 Athleta stores.","On the omni-channel front, Reserve in Store has been rolled out to 500 Gap stores that just started a few weeks ago. So now on top of those 500 Gap stores and 400 Banana Republic stores. The marketing just started behind that to start telling customers because if anybody tries it, loves it. And our goal is to get awareness and trial behind it and we will be piloting next month Order in Store.","If you look at the apparel business, there is a conversion number, and then there is customers who come in and don\u2019t convert. And the portion of the customers who don\u2019t convert, it\u2019s because they couldn\u2019t find their size, couldn\u2019t find their color, couldn\u2019t find exactly what they are looking for. So this pilot is digital, it\u2019s quick and our employees are going to carry that with them on the floor to close the sale.","And lastly on responsive supply chain, we\u2019ve had meetings, Sabrina and myself, the last 30 days to get updates with each one of the brands, really good momentum. There will be some benefit to our operating margin in 2014 in the back half and will really benefit 2015. So the momentum is moving in the right direction.","Now I want to close by telling everybody we\u2019re still very confident here. We mentioned that last month that we\u2019re confident in our full year guidance. We\u2019re committed to our full year guidance. So if you allow me just a little history lesson, in 2008 and 2009 during the depths of recession, we did better than pretty much any other retailer by managing our P&L, managing our cost during difficult consumer times.","In 2010, when conditions got little better, we had a very strong top line and we hit a record operating margin in 2010. 2011, when the cotton crisis hit, that was not our best year. We bounced right back in 2012 and \u201813. There were some operating condition challenges in the first quarter of 2014.","So given the character of the company and how committed we are to delivering on our promises to one another and to shareholders, I have all the confidence we\u2019re going to bounce back in Q2 and beyond and deliver on the guidance we put forward for 2014.","So that said, let me hand it over to Sabrina.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon everyone. Despite a challenging start to the quarter, we continue to focus on levers that drive long-term value. We made progress on our strategic initiative including launching Old Navy in China, Gap in Taiwan and opening additional Athleta stores and we did this while maintaining our operating expense discipline.","Regarding earnings for the quarter, in the first quarter, operating income was $443 million versus $530 million last year. Net earnings were $260 million and earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.71 last year. And as a reminder, we were lapping $0.04 of benefit to last year from the favorable resolution of tax issues.","Additionally, we estimate that the impact from foreign currencies reduced our reported EPS growth rate in Q1 by about 5 percentage points. Sales for the first quarter were $3.8 billion, up 1%. Comp sales were down 1% for the quarter.","The translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $20 million in the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, net sales were up 2%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was down 260 basis points to 38.8%. Merchandise margins were down 230 basis points for the quarter, driven by a challenging February and March which put pressure on our ability to move as many units early in the quarter. Importantly, we did end the quarter with inventory in line with our guidance.","Rents and occupancy deleveraged 30 basis points. As a reminder, we need positive comps to leverage rents and occupancy. And the threshold for ROD leverage is higher this year, likely a low single digit comp, given our mix shift toward international markets like China that have higher ROD cost.","Regarding SG&A, first quarter total operating expenses were $1 billion, up $9 million from the prior year. Marketing expenses were flat to last year at $143 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses leveraged 10 basis points versus last year to 27.1%.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars per store were up 7% at the end of the first quarter in line with our beginning of the quarter guidance. For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $351 million and we distributed $328 million. As part of that distribution, we used $219 million to repurchase 5.6 million shares, resulting in quarter end share count of 443 million.","Regarding capital expenditures and store count, first quarter capital expenditures were $162 million. We opened 15 company-operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3179 stores. Square footage was up 0.5% compared with Q1 2013. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release.","And now I\u2019d like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Our objective overall continues to be delivering modest positive comps on a full year basis. In addition to our comp base, we plan to drive increased revenues through our multiple channels, newer brands and geographies.","Given our remarks just a few weeks ago, I\u2019m sure it comes as no surprise that we are once again reaffirming our full year guidance of $2.90 to $2.95. At its midpoint, this equates to 7% full year EPS growth on a reported basis.","On a constant currency basis, the growth rate is estimated to be 5 percentage points higher or solid double digit growth rate. Underlying this guidance is the following. First, the expectation that we make progress against our goal of tightening our inventory levels with each quarter. At the end of Q2, we expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store to improve by a few points versus the year-over-year increase in Q1. Second, the expectation that our supply initiatives will begin to deliver benefits in the second half of the year especially at Old Navy.","Finally, we remain committed to managing SG&A in a disciplined manner. However recall that leverage is likely to be very modest this year as we moved the portion of our credit card income out of SG&A and into gross margin.","For the full year, the following guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. We expect operating margins to remain flattish on a reported basis as foreign exchange is negatively impacting our margins.","As a reminder, foreign exchange impacts our earnings in two ways. The first is translation and the second is the impact to our merchandise margins. Our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan. And the depreciation of those currencies negatively impacts our cost of goods and therefore our reported results.","We continue to expect square footage to be up about 2.5%. We still plan to open about 185 company-operated stores and close about 70 net of repositions. Store closures are weighted towards Gap North America and store openings are weighted towards China, Old Navy in Japan, Athleta and global outlets. We expect capital expenditures to be about $750 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $520 million. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38.5%.","In closing, as we enter the second quarter, we will continue to focus on levers that we can control like expenses and inventory while we worked to deliver compelling assortments. And we\u2019re encouraged by the recent turn in momentum at our largest brand, Old Navy.","Thank you. And now I will turn it back over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to questions and we\u2019d appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we go to our first question from Adrienne Tennant with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Capital Markets","All right. Can you hear me?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Capital Markets","Well, congratulations on the great start to the year in a very difficult environment. My question is on the inventory change as we go into the back half of the year. Obviously it\u2019s quite improved going into the third quarter. I was wondering, are you making any concessions for what you are now hearing about the West Coast port issues?","And then similarly, Glenn, can you talk about the global Gap merchandise changes and what gives you the confidence, obviously volume is improving but some of the changes there, what gives you the confidence that everything is sort of encapsulated in Q1? Thank you.","Sabrina Simmons","Thanks. I will start with the inventory piece, Adrienne. So we are very much on track to meet our goal of improving our inventory position as each quarter goes by. So in a tough quarter, we are pleased that we met our beginning of the quarter guidance for end of quarter inventory and we just guided that it\u2019s going to improve by a few points to the end of Q2. We will guide later to Q3 and Q4, but we intend to stay on the path of continuing to tighten as the year goes on, so committed to that, that\u2019s inventory.","Regarding the port situation, of course our logistics team is monitoring our situation very closely. We hope of course that it is resolved. But in the meantime, we are very much working through contingency plans as you know following the industry for a long time, it\u2019s not a situation we haven\u2019t faced before. So, we now had to work our plans and how to kick in and take contingency. But we are hoping for a good resolution to that in June.","Glenn Murphy","Hi, Adrienne. Thanks for the congratulations. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s well deserved but I appreciate it.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. I will say it for Old Navy.","Glenn Murphy","All right. I will take Old Navy in the month of April. In terms of Gap Global, we were talking and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve talked about this with our investors. But I know amongst ourselves, we went to our new global model and made the changes that we did. The one quarter, we did circle with ourselves was Q1 2014 for Gap brand, took a look at so many changes that were taking place and so many moving parts that were going on just 12 months ago.","I\u2019ve got a lot of faith. I\u2019ve got a lot of belief in Rebekka Bay and Rebekka in the first quarter because some of those transitions were going on, but we executed best we could. But in fairness to her, she wasn\u2019t facing off with her senior merchants, she was facing off with more junior people at the time and transition. She was the head of women's. So, I hope the first quarter with a lot of moving parts and the fact Rebekka was not surrounded by the kind of supporting cast that every great creative director needs, we didn\u2019t have our best first quarter.","And I think things got a little bit better. I think the product is slow right now but slightly better than what you saw in the first quarter. I think June gets better and especially as I said in my opening remarks, August, as we move to a full global assortment strategy that that Stephen Sunnucks and Michelle Demartini, who is now the senior partner to Rebekka on the merchandising side and Michelle has got 20 years of experience in our business. I think, I\u2019m not saying wait till August. I would say in August, there is a moment where we go to three key assortments around the world, completely simplifies our business as very clear.","However, our good better best strategy across those three assortments. But I've got a lot of faith in what Rebekka in our full team and she has everybody she needs are going to get done. They know they didn\u2019t have the best first quarter and they are accountable for it. But I think that we get better from a pure product to the consumer, as we move into later part of summer and certainly into fall, back couple with the marketing I talked about in the opening comments, I\u2019m counting on speed but that combination will be the magic to get that business back on track.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Capital Markets","Great. Thank you very much. Back to work.","Operator","We move next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. Your consumer are a lot of loyalty to your fit around the world and I was just curious to hear about the extent of your testing before rolling out a global fit to some of your brands?","Glenn Murphy","It\u2019s actually more intense and extensive than I would like it. This is probably the nature of our culture. But when it came to -- that\u2019s an experience, Lorraine, when I started, we had a European fit, the Japanese fit and American fit. And as we started making decisions collectively as a team to move to a global structure, we first start with European fit in that and there is little bit of gross margin left into that in order to liquidate the product properly through Europe and then introduced the American fit, let\u2019s call it, which is now the global fit.","And in Japan, we took a little more time and what we are finding out very clearly is we\u2019ve had to make some very, very minor tweaks, what is now the global fit as we bought Japan in. But all the testing we did with our current customers, lapse customers, new customers on the two fits, the new global fit and the old Japanese that which we did over a year ago. Overwhelmingly, people went for the global benefit and the difference was now is managing the size curve.","Now funny story, we just had Board Meeting this week and I was just talking to members of the Board when I was in Southern China and then went to Japan right afterwards, I found an extra, extra, extra small and I made a phone call to find out that wasn\u2019t a manufacturing production issue but no, that\u2019s the size curve at work. And so in certain markets that size is prevalent. So in Southern China and parts of Japan, we don\u2019t even have that largest, the highest size we go to is large.","So the size curve really gets managed beautifully from the global team, the team we have in New York. And I think that so far so good, not heard anything. And we still got to make sure certain styles that are very Japanese styles like men's cross, which we don\u2019t sell anywhere else. But we sold that in Japan, that's the part of the global assortment. And so I think that we want to make sure we preserve products that resonated in local markets but got to a global fit and you know the reason behind it, besides the simplification to our business. It\u2019s the only way to get the seamless inventory.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we go now to Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo Securities","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just thinking about fabric platforming in the second half, I think it has several benefits. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about the benefit on the AUC side of the equation and when that starts to kick in. And then just second within Athleta, just wondering which categories in that business are performing best which are lagging? Thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","I will start with the fabric platforming, Paul. Certainly, we are making traction on that. So, we have build ourselves internally from start taking it very seriously and we are marching to the goal we set ourselves internally with regard to how much fabric is getting platformed for 2014. With that, certainly should come some average unit costing benefits and that starts in the second half indeed. What I would say though is, we called out that for all of 2014. AUC isn\u2019t a big headline either in terms of headwind because of labor or tailwind because of our tools. I mean, I would say we are managing and we are using the fabric platforming as a critical to all to manage other issues like labor pressures, et cetera. And really the AUC is going to come down to a matter of how our merchant teams and our designers chose to mix the assortment. But we feel, again, like everyone being quite responsible and that average unit costing overall, therefore, it does become a headline.","Glenn Murphy","Just add to that. We started about a year ago with fabric consolidation. I think I may have said in one of the calls, when we start doing some comparisons between ourselves and our three other global competitors. About how many fabrics we actually used in a given year was to say the least embarrassing. So we knew that our creative directors are designers who still had all the flexibility they want in the world because as we dealt directly with Knoll\u2019s which was the second change we made. Their ability to treat the same days cloth in so many different ways was moving in a very fast pace will be quite frank above what we thought was actually doable from some of the leading mills in China especially. So consolidation then went to fever mills doing the work as we build these new relationships and then got to what Sabrina just talked about in terms of platform which has an AUR and then AUC benefit over time.","On the Athleta, it depends on the times we are taking about in Q1 which they had a good performance in Q1. The best performing business in terms of pure comp not in terms of its contribution to the overall business but just comp was what the trend itself has built that was about six months that our other brands are capitalizing on little later than Athleta and that\u2019s just a new definition of sweatpants, street wear, soft dressing. And I think Nancy and team just did an excellent jumping on that. And so, it\u2019s so perfect for Athleta as a compliment to could be either during or as you are performing an activity or could be what they say in this business to the activity or from the activity. And that business provided an incredible level of growth for Athleta.","Now all that really matters (indiscernible) said and done there is this periphery category, that\u2019s not one, that could actually be permanent category for Athleta as it should be a very strong trend going forward for Old Navy and for Gap, but what matters to me is the performance because that\u2019s what all said and done. We have a nice swim business where these are the complementary business, but what matters to me is performance, performance, performance in a fashion twist. And that business was also ahead of its all store comp, the performance category still did better than all store comp. So I would say the category want deliver the growth we needed and this new which again could end up being two years, three years worth of growth coming from the new street wear trend and perhaps and it\u2019s type of customers I think that could do very, very good for that brand.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","And we move now to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. When you talked about your speed pipeline a little bit at your Analyst Day, and I know you were hoping to see some impact from that pipeline in the first half, that looks like it will come in the second half. Can you just help us understand the percentage of your inventory flows in the second half that will come through that speed pipeline? And then if you could look out over the next two to three years ultimately when it\u2019s up and running and fully adopted throughout the organizations, what percentage of your inventory do you think you could actually flow that pipeline? Thanks.","Glenn Murphy","Well, this is what I think and what I believe, and then I will probably just answer to what I believe is actually going to happen, because I am such a believer of long-term in all of the responsive supply chain initiatives we are doing, I know the brand presidents are as well and their teams. Speed is something at the recent Investor meeting we didn\u2019t spent a lot of time talking about to be quite honest. It\u2019s been used by our two outlet teams very well because they are simple, they are quick, they are nimble teams and speed has been very important to them.","My view of it is that now we have proper platforming pretty far down the line and we\u2019ve got test and respond in a little bit in the back half but very, very strong in the first half of 2015. Then, the next priority is to have rapid response which as you know is a longer living style call it 24, 26 weeks where after the first 10 or 12 weeks as we have read, the second or third flow get adjusted based on real selling patterns as opposed to decisions made by the merchant and inventory management team.","So you get, the first flow is put out, you get a read and then you adjust the second and third flow. Speed pipeline, the world class number out there, let\u2019s call it less than 12 weeks. Some are between 40% and 50%. We are in the low-to-mid single digits. In my world, Kimberly, I think I don\u2019t see why with everything I know about our business and the direction it\u2019s moving in our aspiration to get to a much higher operating profit going forward, while the other three components of responsive supply chain will certain contribute to that.","I think speed is going to have to get somewhere between 15% and 20% of our business to really aggregate value and I think we talked a little bit in the Investor meeting about culture. I think the culture understands it, it\u2019s behind it, knows it\u2019s right, they are just going to sequence it likely as the fourth priority under responsive supply chain initiatives and probably get a little of benefit next year. Mostly if I was to characterize it for you, I think in the second half of 2015 as an initiative under responsive supply chain, I could see where speed becomes a bigger part of our business.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","We move now to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Hi, everybody. I had a question on your marketing advertising spend. Several of the companies that I am following as they transition to the digital platform and yield more sales from that channel are gaining some efficiencies and marketing, because it is less costly in that channel than some of the social media venues. And I am wondering if that\u2019s an opportunity that marketing can actually increase, but cost savings maybe inherent because of the channel mix is changing, especially because of the great growth in your omni-channel investments? Thank you.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. Janet, we are starting to make those very transitions and each brand assorted at a different stage. I would say Gap is taking a big lead in moving to digital. We haven\u2019t done TVs in a little bit of time there or maybe actually surprisingly which has for years done the lion\u2019s share of our TV marketing and sort of traditional circular marketing as well. We started talking about in the back half of last year have they started to actually bring television down. And speaking of that in the second quarter coming up here will have two weeks less of television because we are reinvesting that money in other vehicles including not only digital but also our in-store and our windows etcetera.","So we are starting to makes that shift. I continue to encourage the teams to look forward strictly at the spend because I think we are getting with the same spend so we just finished the quarter where marketing spend was equal to last year. I would say for the same spend we are getting to your point a lot of good exposure and marketing both all through our digital platforms as well as our traditional platforms. I think we can actually drive efficiency to your point over time and spend less as we shift to some of these other mediums. So I think that is a discussion that is being hotly debated every single quarter as we move forward here. And the teams are definitely looking at all of that.","Janet Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Okay. And I don\u2019t if we deal this or not, but for the August campaign for Gap, would that be a TV campaign or some combination of TV and other than news as well?","Sabrina Simmons","For this coming August more to come on that. Yes, we are in transition with the new agency so that is still in development, but we are definitely going to have a lot of digital materials that can be used for our websites for a lot of different medium. So in progress and more to come.","Janet Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Great. I look forward to it. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Hi, Glenn, regarding your early comments on the opportunities you spoke about customer communication. I was just curious if you could elaborate there on where you see opportunity and what levers that would drive in terms of the business? Thank you.","Glenn Murphy","My take Oliver was that given the operating conditions that we dealt within the first half of the quarter that we took a step back in our customer communication. That\u2019s less to do with Janet\u2019s question on mediums and content and how to actually get that out to social tools or other tools. I just found that we became reactive, little defensive and used traditional means to communicate value and to drive traffic which is percentage offs way too frequently and we\u2019re too good a company for that. We have very strong brands.","Certain brands out there that we have to compete against or near us, but we don\u2019t have a direct competitive opportunity with. I guess that if you\u2019re on the strong brand, then you have to make up for it with more traditional ways of driving customer attention and driving traffic conversion. But when -- in your portfolio you have Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy, I just have higher expectations I said in the opening.","And if we look at the businesses that did do that, that found the right balance between our enlightened and provocative customer communications because the customers are looking for that these days, found the right medium, and struck the right balance between that and the value proposition, it wasn\u2019t predictable. We had a very good business. Case in point I mentioned Athleta, we don\u2019t give up their comp, they had a very good Q1.","And Old Navy, Old Navy is out of the park in April because they struck the absolute great balance between provocative customer communication and a unique way of presenting value. And the other brands know that and they\u2019re going to do that going-forward. I mean this is what we expect of portfolio where we have six brands and three iconic ones, not to be treated like just any brand.","So higher expectations going forward, I think the teams know that, even they do, do it. The things little bit more work and it involves more creativity and innovation of thought. We\u2019ll may do, do it, our business and our customers respond . So I\u2019ll be watching very closely and making sure that they get back on track that we expect in the next three quarters.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","We go now to Jennifer Davis with Buckingham Research Group.","Jennifer Davis - Buckingham Research Group","Hey, guys, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about China. I mean, I know you have invested in it and I think the largest part of your investments are over. But I was wondering if as a region it\u2019s profitable or if there is a certain number of stores that you need to get to, to get to that level. So if you could just talk a little bit about that. Thanks.","Glenn Murphy","We have said for the last three years that it would obviously be a drain on our earnings, as we made investments in people, in our office now of 175 people in Shanghai made significant investments in marketing. It was mentioned in Oliver\u2019s question earlier about brand building that\u2019s especially important. You get lost in the sea of commodities and in apparel in China, if you\u2019re not careful.","But I think that the business is really strong. We feel really good about the comp performance of our existing stores that's now a pool. Soon, it would be a pool of 82 stores, sometime in 2014. We have 30 more stores going in this year. We\u2019ll have five to six, Old Navy\u2019s by the end of the year. All of them have online capabilities and went into Taiwan. By the amount of capital, we are spending there, the amount of energy you\u2019re getting to most senior level of the company, China reports directly to me.","I think it\u2019s a real strong indicator to our shareholders and the analysts that we believe we\u2019ve got a tiger by the tail. And we think that\u2019s going to be by far our second biggest market sooner rather than later. And feel good about the performance all around and profitability is going to be there because we think we\u2019ve got the economic model, as we project forward and look at the productivity in each one of our stores.","We look at the gross margin rate. We think, we can achieve based on three years of operating. Probably, SG&A is going to flow, what the rod is going to look like. We believe the economic model for China is going to be very attractive to the business. But we\u2019re not going to sacrifice, which we may have made that mistake going into new countries in the past, especially with our franchise markets. We\u2019re not going to sacrifice the near to mid-term investments for a real great long-term business.","But we feel very good about it. We\u2019ve got a great team there running it and we\u2019re going to continue to make investments. But when it turns to profitability and I\u2019ve not yet declared a date, when it does that, it\u2019s going to move very quickly into contributing profitable country as opposed to what it is today.","Sabrina Simmons","And just the dynamic to keep in mind, Gap is improving in its profile every year and so it\u2019s not very dilutive, if you just look at Gap brand. But of course, we just launched Old Navy. So you are going to have to consider the fact that each brand launch also consumes sequence point, a meaningful amount of investment to establish the brand in the right locations with the right marketing. But if you think of Gap brand alone, it\u2019s definitely making progress toward its path to profitability.","Jennifer Davis - Buckingham Research Group","Okay. Great. And should we think of that as, kind of, eventually a similar operating margins or potentially higher operating margin than North America?","Glenn Murphy","It\u2019s a little bit soon to tell. I mean, I guess our thesis coming in, was that it\u2019s going to be a strong, very strong online market that\u2019s proving out. As you know that\u2019s an operating margin in that channel is over and above our bricks and mortar business. It\u2019s a little -- on that one, I\u2019m pretty confident. Disproportionately, it\u2019s going to be a very strong online business. The omni-channel, I still believe long-term that it's going to have multitudes, hopefully more than a hundred, very good outlet centers and that also is an operating margin over and above our bricks-and-mortar business.","That one -- we\u2019ll see how that one plays out. It\u2019s not heading the same trajectory, I might have assumed two years ago. Looks good and we\u2019re going to open 8 or 10 a year for the foreseeable future. But I\u2019m hoping that will pickup as more developers from outside of China, including Chinese developers build these amazing outlet centers. The 10 or 12 run rate now are fantastic and we just think of the right mix of tenants. ","So we'll see how that plays out but for us it\u2019s a productivity per foot is better than average than most cases you can assume. We can get a better operating margin for total country than we have in North America. So let\u2019s hope that the sales per foot in China continued at the rates they are right now.","Jennifer Davis - Buckingham Research Group","All right. Great. Thanks and best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Hi, Good afternoon, everyone. Glenn, I was wondering if you could talk about, I know it\u2019s a little early but if you could just talk about, you have a lot of initiatives going on, whether that be the global Gap assortment Reserve in Store, Order in Store, et cetera. How do you think about the holiday season or this holiday season, how you plan to address that? Given that you have so many different initiatives going on, so many stories to tell and so many different ways to tell those stories? Thank you.","Glenn Murphy","Sounds a good question. What I can tell you, we may have said on the February call that we really thought we could have done better in holiday 2013. A little bit to an earlier question I used the same word. I think we are little too predictable. And our holiday assortment, our holiday messaging and -- but this is a good customer relatively speaking but they\u2019re not. They need a different kind of communication than the customer of 2007. You got to reach out in a much more different way.","They need to really be inspired and engaged in order to participating in brand. We came back in January and the teams right away got involved. It\u2019s fresh on their minds into holiday \u201814 planning. So what I can tell you is that -- that we\u2019re making the necessary adjustments. It\u2019s not -- we\u2019re not quite blowing it up but we are severely changing how we\u2019re going to deal with holiday 2014 starting with product.","We\u2019re definitely going to change the cadence in which we speak to customers and we basically looking at a November 1 to December 24 timeline. We know it\u2019s a global business. So it\u2019s not like the opportunity for us is only in North America, it\u2019s a global opportunity to do the right thing in the holiday season, marketing, mix of channels, delivery schedules for online. I think we have torn the whole thing upside down in the month of January and we are really working hard.","It\u2019s a very important quarter for us. But we want to make sure we end strong because ending strong, in lot of cases means you can start strong. So lot of great work has gone on to get ready for Q4 and I think happy maybe in the call in August to fill you in more.","Matt McClintock - Barclays","Thank you very much.","Katrina O'Connell","Great.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Incorporated First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","Tina Romani","Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Gap, Inc's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.","For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as the description and reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures as noted on Page 2 of the slide supplementing Teri's remarks. Please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com.

As mentioned, we will be using slides to supplement our remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Art Peck","Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us.","I'll begin the call with a discussion of some of the macro industry-wide influences on the quarter and the performance of each of our brands. Then, I'll ask Teri to walk us through detailed financials and we'll finish with an update on our previously announced plans to launch two independent publicly traded companies.","You've seen our press release, and obviously we're disappointed in our Q1 results. Not unlike others in the industry, our results highlight some of the macro challenges we all faced. As you know, this was one of the coldest, wettest quarters in memory, and while traffic and sales trends improved, as we moved through March and April, it was difficult to overcome the extremely slow business that we and others encountered in February.","In addition to the poor weather, we had late spring breaks, a late Easter and delayed and lower tax refunds thrown into the mix as well. We also missed opportunities on our own, and we could have executed as always better across places in our brands.","We recognize the needs of our customers are changing and we're not waiting around, hoping that we muddle through. We're running towards what we see as an exciting next step in our evolution. As you remember, last quarter we announced our intent to launch two new companies that will be uniquely positioned to compete in the evolving retail environment.","Old Navy and the New Company, comprised of our specialty brands. The rationale behind the separation is simple, and we will continue to reiterate it. The needs of our specialty and our value customers are diverging, and the pace of change in retail continues to accelerate.","Our planned separation will enable each brand to move more quickly and efficiently to maximize focus and flexibility, to align investments to meet unique business needs, and to optimize cost structures to deliver profitable growth. We'll come back to the separation in a moment and give an update on our progress later in the call.","Now let's turn to the results specific to the quarter. Beginning with Old Navy, our results were not what we expect from this powerhouse brand, though we did see improvement during the Easter season. When I look to Old Navy, I see a brand with a strong track record and a long clear runway for growth ahead.","The underlying fundamentals that made the brand so successful over the years have fundamentally not changed. Old Navy has a powerful, almost unique four-wall model, a highly valued value proposition for our customers and strong brand health.","Even with macro headwinds and some product business, Old Navy's traffic was flat to the industry for the quarter and we modestly gained market share in the brand. Part of the growth plan for Old Navy is simple store penetration. We expanded our retail footprint with six new stores in Q1, and with plans to open 20 in Q2, and a total of 70 forecasted for the year.","While new stores offer a clear path to growth for Old Navy, e-commerce also continues to expand with impressive double-digit comps online in both traffic and conversion. Reinforcing our view that stores and online are complementary channels when paired thoughtfully, the buy online pickup-in store program continues to help us better understand the intersection of offline and online shopping behavior for the Old Navy customer.","Turning to Gap brand, while the comps for the quarter were disappointing, the story of Gap brand, as we have continued to say, is that of a brand focused on regaining profitability. The brand has made significant operational improvements in inventory, product assortment, and expense reduction.","Our aggressive store closure plan to rationalize the specialty fleet is on track, and we remain committed to quickly, thoughtfully and decisively eliminating stores that are underperforming. It's through these tough actions that we set the stage for additional progress and for the rejuvenation of this brand.","Let me then turn obviously to traffic, which was a major challenge at Gap quarter - Gap brand for the quarter. Though some of that weakness was expected, we intentionally shifted marketing resources out of the first quarter and in to late Q2 and Q3, and this was aligned with revamping our marketing efforts to match the continuing improvements in product and importantly a strong denim presentation.","You'll also see Gap brand reinvest in marketing, kids and baby business with a strong back-to-school push later this year. This is especially important, given that market share is now up for grabs, and this is a clear opportunity for Gap brand given its strong equity in kids and baby.","Banana Republic also experienced the impact of the unseasonably cold weather in February and March, customers wanted more wear-now items such as outerwear, at a time when we were offering spring fashion. As weather improved in April, so did the performance. Despite the weak quarter, I'm pleased with our progress at Banana.","Just a few years ago, there were questions about the core viability of the brand. We moved in a new management team, got back to the fundamentals of delivering high quality, reliable products and today, Banana Republic is earning its place in the Gap Inc. portfolio.","Athleta continues to be one of North America's fastest growing athletic brand and is positioned to capture share. Despite unseasonable weather, growth continued to outpace the market by a factor of two. We're obviously all committed on Athleta, and in 2019, we are accelerating store growth with approximately 25 new stores versus our historical average of 15 to 20 openings per year.","Part of the Athleta magic is its clear brand identity and its commitment to sustainability. Athleta just celebrated its first year as B Corp by announcing progress against its sustainability goals, including 60% of materials now being made from sustainable fibers. Customers connect with the fundamental ethos of the brand in a way that is difficult to duplicate or replace, and that connection is part of why we're so bullish on the Athleta opportunity moving forward.","We've tended over time to focus our calls on the larger brands as they have the greatest impact on our economics. But we're also seeing significant and interesting progress in our smaller properties. We're seeing positive trends at Intermix, where fresh inventory, on-trend product assortment, and an improved e-commerce platform, and stronger digital marketing strategies led to both growth online and in-store.","We also have our new digitally native men's active brand Hill City. Again, there were only a few months in, but as the brand develops, we look forward to sharing more on the progress of what we believe is a very exciting opportunity.","And last, I'd like to formally welcome and discuss for a moment, the latest addition to the portfolio, Janie and Jack. Janie and Jack is a high-end children clothing brand with about 140 locations across the U.S. and an attractive profitable online channel. The brand sits at a premium higher price point for kids and baby than the offerings currently found at Gap and Old Navy and was a great tuck-in, and we believe significant potential acquisition for us going forward.","Finally, I'd be remiss to not address the topic that impacts the entire industry recently announced intent on tariffs on clothing manufactured in China, which largely translates into a tax on American consumers.","As you're hearing on many of these calls, there is a significant uncertainty around what goods the tariffs may apply to and at what level they may be applied. But we've been migrating sourcing out of China for the last several years, and we'll continue to do this responsibly going forward.","As recently as three years ago, about 25% of our product was manufactured in China. In our most recent disclosure, that number was down to 21%. And if you include only apparel, our penetration is approximately 16%, which is significantly lower than the relevant portions of the industry.","Our current guidance incorporates the impact of List 3 goods, but does not include the proposed List 4 changes. We're actively monitoring the issue, we're actively engaged in the conversation, and we're managing our sourcing operations accordingly.","I do want to speak for a moment on the separation, but I think it's important that Teri take us through financial results for the quarter, and our outlook for the year. Teri, over to you.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks, Art. Good afternoon, everyone.","As I said, we are not pleased with our results this quarter, similar to the complexion of our fourth quarter results, there were several industry-wide macro factors contributing to our performance, as well as areas of opportunity within our control, where we could and must execute better.","As we previewed in our last call, the historically cold start to the year negatively impacted all of our businesses, particularly Old Navy, which tends to see outsized impact from unseasonable weather patterns.","While we did see an improvement from February into the combined March and April period across all of our brands, the improvement was below plan and was not enough to offset February softness.","Let me take a moment to walk through some of the drivers of brand performance, before going to the specific results. Beginning with Old Navy, as we talked in the back half of last year, we had identified product softness in certain areas of our women's assortment, which have been addressed with leadership and process changes that will show up in the assortment as we move through the year.","During the quarter, these challenges were exacerbated by a generally soft apparel retail environment, which we attribute primarily to a much cooler weather pattern than a year-ago. We saw the weather impacts most acutely and looking at the spread between where now and where forward category accounts, which were about 7 points different.","While online delivered a high teens comp, with growth in both traffic and conversion, store performance was much more challenged, driven by negative traffic trends, which we also partially attribute to weather. As you know, the specific diagnosis and quantification of weather impacts in our business can be tough, particularly with the variability we've seen across the competitive set.","From a product perspective, the team identified that our product offering was too narrow and lack diversity in silhouette, print and pattern and color. Our Old Navy customer response to a broad assortment and overall we did not provide her with enough choice. With these key insights derived from customer response to holiday and spring product, the design and merchandising teams were able to significantly redesign the fall season, with even more ability to influence holiday.","Additionally, while we entered the year clean from a viable perspective, we were heavier in inventory than we would have liked coming into the quarter, especially given lower than expected traffic trends. As a result we were significantly more promotional in the quarter to move through units resulting in meaningful product margin compression in the quarter.","We have adjusted Old Navy's inventory buys for the balance of the year and they now are much tighter to match industry trends and drive inventory productivity. For perspective, unit inventory comps were up mid-single digits in Q1, and are plan to be flat and down mid-singles for Q2 in the back half, respectively. As a result, we do expect sequential merchandise margin improvement as we move through the year.","One of the key strengths of the Old Navy model is the robust and repeatable product to market process. The leadership team has taken the learnings from these last two quarters to infuse more rigor around their established processes that drive the business. Importantly, the Old Navy brand fundamentally remains strong as it continues to build share on a rolling 12-month basis, with consistently strong NPS and YouGov indicators.","Old Navy continues to leverage its unique positioning in the sector at those intersection of value, speed, and curation. The brand remains grounded in creating affordable on-trend, high quality fashion for the whole family, while ensuring the customer field funded every touch point, this $8 billion brand provides. We continue to see a long runway for growth with share growth opportunity to improved comps, new store openings and continued online strength.","Turning to the Gap brand, our top line was negatively impacted by weather and traffic trends. We were able to improve the brand's overall profitability through gross margin expansion, and continued expense reduction. The team has been focused on improving inventory composition and product assortment.","During the quarter, we had particularly focused on yield management, despite the tougher traffic trends. As we move throughout the year, we have a particular focus on re-establishing our strength in Denim with improved quality fit and silhouettes. We remain focused on driving improvement in the brand with cleaner inventory positions, better product assortment, leaner inventory buys, and continued cost discipline.","Moving to Banana. Similar to Old Navy and Gap, unseasonably cold weather negatively impacted spring product sales for much of the quarter. As weather improved, we saw an inflection in trends, but recognize there are still opportunities for improvement in terms of product, assortment and marketing.","As our fashion product acceptance continues to improve, the team is focused on balancing our inventory mix and offering more of the she wants by increasing the depth across key fashion buys, and marketed styles, while driving overall inventory productivity.","Lastly, with regards to Athleta, while February was tough, we saw sequential improvement in comp trends as we move through the quarter with a 12 point comp improvement from February to the combined March-April period. The swim category was soft largely related to fit in coverage product challenges. The team is evaluating how we can best serve our customers in this challenging category with several in-store test programs that will help us inform strategy for next year.","Fundamental brand health remained strong, as evidenced by market share gains, continued customer file growth and strength in other key health metrics such as the average spend per customer, and frequency.","Let me move to overall performance. Just as a reminder, you saw in our disclosures, during the quarter we completed the sale of the headquarters building we owned, but did not occupy as part of a tax efficient exchange for the Old Navy headquarters building, we purchased at the start of the year. We completed the sale for $220 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $191 million and is included as an offset to operating expenses within our reported results.","So starting with sales, our net sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion, down about 2% last year. Comp sales were down 4%, compared with the positive 1% last year. Spread for the quarter was largely driven by new store openings at Old Navy and Athleta as well as non-comp Janie and Jack sales, partially offset by the Gap store closures.","The vibrant comps clearly were below our initial expectations and we're working aggressively to adjust our plans to respond to the macro trends and strengthen our product and marketing plans for the remainder of the year.","Moving to gross margin, our first quarter gross margin was down 140 basis points to 36.3%. Merch margin was down 120 basis points, primarily driven by Old Navy, partially offset by Gap brand margin expansion. Rents and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points, primarily driven by the lower sales.","On SG&A, on a reported basis, first quarter total operating expenses were $1 billion, which included the $191 million benefit from the building sale gain. You will see that we have separately called out the costs associated with separation as well as specialty fleet restructuring costs. Together, these were only $5 million on the quarter, but we wanted to provide visibility as we move through these important transformational steps.","Excluding those items, our adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 110 basis points, reflecting the lower sales and increased expenses related to technology investments, the addition of Janie and Jack, and a modest increase in Old Navy store labor, which we are rightsizing to match business needs.","Two additional points on this. First, we continue to believe that marketing is a key element of our business model and investment there is required to keep our brands healthy and traffic strong. Clearly to yield the best return, those investments would be matched to strong product and customer experience. During the first quarter, that wasn't true for Old Navy and Gap, so we held back on marketing and we'll reinvest as the product fundamentals improve.","Second, and importantly, our productivity efforts remain a key priority with savings goals in place for the year. Inevitably, there will be some inefficiencies as we move towards the launch of Old Navy and the new company, as stand-alone entities. But we are looking at that as a catalyst for even more dramatic changes to the operating models that will optimize the unique strengths in respective scale of two more focused companies.","On taxes, our effective tax rate was 24.8% on the first quarter. The lower rate versus our original guidance was primarily driven by the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax earnings. We expect our full year reported effective tax rate to be about 27%. When we exclude certain non-cash tax impacts related to expected restructuring charges, we continue to expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 26%.","On earnings, on a reported basis, our earnings per share were $0.60. Excluding the building sale as well as costs associated with separation and fleet restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.24. Foreign exchange was a benefit of about $0.01 for the quarter, but is not expected to be meaningful for the year.","Our free cash flow was negative $136 million, with an improvement of $68 million over last year. This reflects a lower bonus payout, partially offset by an increase in capital spending, primarily due to earlier planned store openings and timing of technology and supply chain projects.","We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments comfortably within our target cash threshold. Consistent with our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, we completed $50 million of share repurchases in Q1 and paid dividends of $92 million. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $50 million per quarter. We ended the quarter with 378 million shares outstanding.","Regarding inventory, we ended the quarter with inventory up 10% compared to last year. There are couple of drivers behind the increase, including about 1 point impact from store openings, net of closures; about 2 point impact from the Janie and Jack acquisition; about a 2 point impact driven by an increase in in-transit times.","As others have noted, ocean freight carrier bankruptcies have resulted in carrier consolidation and larger vessels used for transport. These larger vessels generally take longer to load and off-load, resulting in an overall increase in in-transit time of about three to four days.","Well, we have not seen any increase in ocean freight costs, we did begin to see the longer in-transit times beginning in Q4 of last year. While this normalized 5% increase is better than the reported, it still is too high against our near-term expectations for growth given the current dynamics in the market.","As we mentioned for several brands, we are buying inventory tighter over the remainder of the year. Our inventory productivity has slipped for a number of years, and we must get back to best-in-class levels. We have invested in the necessary responsive tools to improve productivity, we have designed, improved operating processes, and put in place controls to deliver improved operating discipline, and now we are focused on rightsizing our inventory levels to the appropriate channel demand to improve yield and return.","Regarding capital in store count, our year-to-date capital expenditures were $165 million. At the start of the year, we guided to fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of about $750 million, which includes about $650 million of base capital and $100 million of non-routine expansion costs related to one of our headquarters buildings and a build out of our Ohio D.C.","Excluding the $100 million of non-routine costs, we have reduced our base capital to be about $575 million. The reduction in capital spend is primarily driven by changes in our key priorities and timing of Old Navy remodels.","We remain focused on two key priorities, continuing to tap the profitable growth opportunities for Old Navy and Athleta retail footprint. And investing prudently in technology and supply chain initiatives that position all of our brands well for competitive differentiation.","It's important to note, we expect a separation to affect capital requirements, which we are currently assessing and which could impact future spending levels. As we have better visibility into these potential costs, we will provide more information as relevant.","On a net basis, we added nine Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic stores during the quarter, and we acquired a 140 Janie and Jack locations. At Gap brand, we closed eight stores, primarily in North America, net of openings, primarily in Asia. We ended the quarter with 3,335 company-operated stores. We've added about 10 new store openings for the year at Old Navy and Athleta and now expect 30 net store closures for the year.","With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, given the disappointing start and with unseasonable weather trends continuing through May, we are reducing our full-year earnings per share guidance.","On a reported basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.04 to $2.14 for the full year. Excluding the gain on building sale, the restructuring costs, and any costs associated with preparing for and executing the separation, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.15.","We now expect net sales to be about flat for the year, with comp sales for the full-year to be down low-single digits, and spread up low-single digits, driven by new store openings. We now expect adjusted first half earnings per share to decrease approximately 35% relative to EPS for the same period last year. And we continue to expect an improvement in second half comp and margin trends compared to the first half of the year, largely for the reasons I described at the start of my remarks.","In closing, as we said, this was a difficult quarter. However, we have clear line of sight to the actions that we need to take both to strengthen our operating performance and respond to the retail environment we currently are facing. Importantly, we remain focused on the actions that we believe will set all of our brands up for long-term value creation.","What we are seeing in the industry today supports our view that to position our current brands for sustained growth, they are best served by launching Old Navy, as a standalone Company with a single-minded focus on winning with its unique value proposition and strategies in a growing retail segment. And the new company as a portfolio of brands with the scaled operating platform that can leverage an attractive customer base and pursue enhanced margin opportunities.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Art for an update.","Art Peck","Thanks a lot, Teri.","Obviously, we are not pleased with this quarter, but I do want to spend a moment on the separation, which we announced during our last call, and we've made quite a bit of progress on over the course of the last couple of months. This decision to launch Old Navy as a standalone public company is not, I repeat, not a reaction to short-term trends, and we believe what we are seeing in the industry today validates our view to win in apparel retail, you need to be focused on unique competitive differentiation against a targeted customer base.","This is the logic that we have used, it's the analysis that we have done, and we're doubly committed to making this happen. Importantly, we remain on track as we work towards executing the separation into two independent companies in 2020.","As part of the separation work, we formed a project management office with a dedicated team to minimize distraction to the current business operations. The team's charter is clear and simple. Plan the separation efficiently and set up each company for success. We look forward to sharing additional updates on progress over the coming months. And Sonia Syngal, who will lead the Independent Old Navy, and I will host an investor event in mid-September to continue the conversation.","With that, let's open the line for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets.","Kate Fitzsimons","Just given the reduction in guidance, could you just speak a little bit to maybe some of the trends you're seeing here in May? And then Teri, just as we're thinking about the inventory X transit in Janie and Jack upside, can you speak to where it maybe it is concentrated by the brands, and how we should think about 2Q gross margins relative here to what we saw on Q1? Thanks so much.","Teri List-Stoll","Sure. So with regard to the start of May, we are seeing kind of a repeat of some of the macro factors of Q1 with the colder, wetter weather and it has been very much unseasonably so. And so, that's basically the story as we sit here today. We do see bright spots when the weather turns, so we remain convinced that it is primarily weather related, but we need to ride that out.","Obviously, on the inventory plus five going into the quarter with those kinds of trends, we do find ourselves in a bit of the same cycle where we're probably going to end up having to be a little more promotional than we would like to continue move through the units and make sure that we're getting into the second half, again both clean from a liable perspective, but also more rightsized against the expectations for growth in the second half. And so my expectation is, we'll continue to see some of that margin pressure. I definitely think we can do it in a more targeted manner than we might have done in Q1, we certainly learn as we go. And as we think about our commercial plan for Q2, we're definitely taking all of our learnings from Q1 and making sure that we optimize yield as we continue to move through those units.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","As you think about the Old Navy business, and the changes in trend over the past two quarters or so, how much of it do you feel is due either to the distraction with the separation, internal product issues in the consumer, or is it external factors? How do you unpack it in order to say here is how it gets back on track? Thank you.","Art Peck","I'm sure, you can jump in here to point number one, which is distraction minimal to de-minimis, I mean really truly, it's why Dana that I highlighted the fact that we've follow best practices, we've talked to a number of other companies that have gone through this process as well as outside advisors and really set up a project management office that is - with a specific intent to isolate the separation work from the operations of the business. We are acutely aware of the fact that there is a ton of work here that needs to happen, and that it is not allowable to let it bleed over into the operations of the business.","And so far, I'm pretty confident that we have a structure that has really protected the operations of the business, and the team is really focused on not just the in-season management, but obviously making corrections in out-seasons for the business. I never like to play the macro factor, but it's a legitimate play in this case.","Whatever article you read on weather, we saw unprecedented levels and I won't go into it because, Dana, and all the rest of you - you've seen it, you've tracked it here, of moisture, of temperature, obviously the violent weather we're seeing in parts of the country, et cetera. It's clearly an issue and Old Navy given its locational strategy, which is you have to work to get there.","Number two, the fact that Kids\/ Baby business, which is an important part of the Old Navy business tends to be more of a wear-now business. Both of those factors kicked in at Old Navy. I'm not going to say it was entirely as I've said all along the way, and I will continue to say we are never going to be perfect. There are couple of trends that we probably went with a little bit too long, especially in terms of the dress business.","That all said, we're playing well in the bottoms business right now, across all of our brands where we're seeing the proper silhouettes in Denim, the proper rise, et cetera. So to me, I'm not going to give you a split, but the great majority of this I think as we've seen again with other people reporting was really a factor that the - it was just a very tough environment for apparel, the independent data shows that that was the case.","And we've planned for a better month and move the units. We obviously, in Old Navy in particular, put some pressure on margins to move the units through the business. Teri, do you want to add more on that?","Teri List-Stoll","No.","Operator","And we'll go next to Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR.","Susan Anderson","You talked about - I guess the baby business being little weak at Old Navy, I guess, I was kind of curious, and maybe it's more kids related too across your format. Did you see any impact potentially from the Gymboree liquidation?","Art Peck","Absolutely. Hard to quantify it, but there was a ton of inventory that got pushed through the system in a short period of time. And if you were in those stores, what you would have seen is that it was kind of three seasons that moved through simultaneously. There was some fall and certainly holiday merchandise, there was spring merchandise, and then there were longer lead time buys that they already had in the pipeline, in terms of some summer product as well.","I can't tell you what the exact quantification of it is, but as we looked at it, when it was happening acutely. We saw it clearly in the business and we saw it in the traffic numbers as well. There was a distortion, we believe in industry traffic associated with that liquidation. So, the good news is that's behind us. We don't know if the consumer is going to sit on the sidelines, having just eaten a big meal, if you will, in participating in the liquidation. We're not really seeing evidence of that right now.","But we have somebody like that with that many stores and that much products in the system pushing it out at very, very deep discounts in a short-period of time, it is going to have an impact on anybody playing in the same space.","Susan Anderson","And maybe just one follow-up, if I could. If you could maybe just give some color, I was curious how the active wear category performed both that Gap and Old Navy versus fashion apparel? Thanks.","Art Peck","Yes, I'm not going to go into specific numbers. We don't obviously give those out. I would say that what we really saw in active is the same proportional performance that we've been saying there which is active as a category has for a while, been growing above the rate of the overall ready-to-wear category. We have experienced pretty consistently performance that has matched that.","And while even active as you know, looking at us and others has come down over that quarter because of it. We did see positive comps at Old Navy in that category and we are continuing to be bullish across the entire space where we play in active. It's a segment that is lifestyle based, is above average growth and we're going to continue to put our shoulder against it.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","I know there is only so much commentary at this juncture to share around the split. But just curious around why we are waiting to the split - to maybe take some of the more aggressive and dramatic actions around structural - around the structure of the business and some of the operational changes. That seem to be coming once you all actually get to that point.","Art Peck","Well, let me just highlight where we are on the split, is maybe the best way to do this. Because it's actually - Teri is sitting here with a smile on her face, because we're pushing in many respects harder than the comfort level is of the organization to move forward. And I want to post as many points as I can, as we're going through the split. We're only a matter of a couple of months into it right now.","Since we announced it, we did make it clear that we needed to announce before we could begin the real work. We have - what I'd describe as a bit of a luxury that you really get, to really think deeply and do the analysis in the face of this catalytic events to drive very, very aggressive change. And that is the work that is underway right now.","I am concerned around obviously delivering performance quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, but I am at least equally concerned about making sure that we're making the right structural decisions for both of these businesses, in light of the environment we're in, the evolving environment, the changing customers to set these companies up for success.","And everything that we have heard and seen and talked with companies that have been through this, is the caution to make sure that we are keeping our eye on the long game here that is going to be played out at both of these companies separate and become two separate operating companies.","So, I would then also then caution you, which is just because it isn't necessarily public right now, don't assume that we're not doing very, very aggressive work under the covers. And then the last thing I would say is, respect the fact obviously that this has - it's kind of the split and the work that we're intending to do with respect to the operating model, the overhead structure, it has pretty profound impact on lots of people in this organization, and we are going to manage our way through that, respectfully in terms of communication and making sure that the impact is managed appropriately as we work our way through this.","So we are certainly not throttling our ambition or throttling our work, but I want to manage through this in a - yeah, it's a very complicated thing, and I want to make sure that we get through it in a way where all the parts work when we come out the other side.","Paul Trussell","Absolutely. And then just a follow-up, maybe just quickly update us on the store closures and what you're seeing from new store productivity with Old Navy? Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, so on the Gap fleet restructuring, we said we expect to close about 230 specialty stores over the next two years. Most of those - many of those 150 or so will occur with natural lease expiration and the remainder will be ones that we actively negotiate to close. The closures for 2019 will largely happen in the fourth quarter. So I would overall just call the program on track to deliver what we said that it would, and we definitely we'll keep you posted as we move through the year.","On the Old Navy new store productivity, as Art referred to earlier, they have a very attractive four wall model and that shows in the new stores, we are opening, which is a part of what gives us such great confidence as we think about the growth prospects ahead for the brand. So we are seeing the new stores performed at or above our pro forma expectations.","We're also seeing that as we invest in remodeling, which we've done initially, quite thoughtfully as we tested the power of the remodels, but then did enough a larger scale last year and are continuing this year. And even there, we're seeing a meaningful lift in the sales as we invest in our stores. So just confirms that stores remain a very important part of the overall operating model, not just for Old Navy, but for all of our brands. And so we're really pleased with what we're seeing there.","Art Peck","I would just pile on this one because it's super important, and obviously as we get to the September meeting that Sonia, and I will host, and then go into the spring of next year, as we're talking more detail about both companies.","One of the most important foundational cornerstones of Old Navy as a business is an exceptional four-wall model. And I'm a big believer that we are still the bricks-and-mortar retailer with an incredibly successful fast growing complementary online business, but it all starts inside the four walls. And nothing, and I would just underline, nothing has done anything other than give us confidence about the growth opportunity, as we've continued to roll out stores in smaller markets and infill opportunities.","And as Teri mentioned, even very low scope remodels, which are largely a can of paint and a paintbrush, have yielded really good returns in terms of the lift in the business and the return on investment that we're making. So, and this is pretty foundational, obviously to the growth thesis in front of the business.","Operator","We'll go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Dan Stroller","This is Dan Stroller on for Simeon, thanks for taking our questions. On the DTC channel, I guess is there anything you could parse out with trends within that channel, our expectations for the year, and how should we think about margin dynamics in store versus online? Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","There is no meaningful change there. We did, we continue to post strong results in online - the margin dynamics there as we've said before, it's profitable business and incrementally profitable, an incremental sale in the online channel is accretive to us. So really nothing new to report there, in general, this is a large attractive business.","As Art said, very complementary to how we think of our overall approach to the customer, which is, she is using the online channel, even if she is not shopping in the online channel. And so we continue to learn from the customer journey to be able to tailor our response and provide an experience that - that is satisfying for her or she makes her final purchase.","Art Peck","And I would just add to that and say, we are, where she wants us to be, which is, if she is moving and shopping more on her phone, we're definitely there with her. We're seeing pretty encouraging metrics coming out of that mobile customer, BOPIS which as you know we lit up in Old Navy first, we're continuing to see the penetration go up there.","As you know again, I'll just reiterate it right now, Old Navy has kind of - focus in Old Navy and focus in any of our brands is a win-win-win-win. It's getting a customer into our store, who is highly qualified, it's eliminating the below the line expense, gives us an opportunity to sell the customer immediate gratification.","And as we continue to increase penetration there, we're really seeing how to tailor that capability for her, how to market it to her et cetera. So nothing but big bullish on continuing progress and stay the course aggressively on the DTC overall business that we have for all of our brands.","Dan Stroller","Also, if I could just get one more, given the Gap brand marketing shift, how should we think about SG&A growth for the year? Thanks a lot.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. So we deleverage this quarter. As we look forward over the remainder of the year, obviously we'll be continuing to drive operating cost discipline. But inevitably, we will probably see some deleverage on the year, which is contrary to the trends we had been driving and really the objective of our productivity program. So we'll be doing everything we can to bring that number down.","But at the moment, I think it's safe as to expect some amount of deleverage, as we really continue to invest in the marketing, that we do think is important, particularly as the product assortment strengthens in Old Navy and Gap.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Lauren Frasch","This is Lauren Frasch on for Ike. I wanted to ask about Athleta, sales growth in the other segments slowed pretty persistently to mid-single digits in the quarter. Could you provide a little more color around Athleta's performance and how that reconciles with the accelerated openings this year. Thank you.","Art Peck","Well, the accelerated openings are in front of us. We did note the fact that this quarter and the weather trends in the quarter as broadly impacted the apparel sector. I have zero concerns about the health of Athleta, zero concerns about the health of the brand, zero concerns about customer engagement. If I had to call something negative out of the macro factors is swim, partly also by weather, but swim was a tougher category this year.","And it's something that we'll continue to look at. I made some changes to the swim business when I was running Gap brand, and it can be challenging, but that's really the place where I'd have to put my finger. I think overall, again, we think Athleta is well-positioned in the space that it's in, its got an incredibly loyal customer, it is truly omni.","When you're dealing with some unprecedented, unusual weather and she is standing on the sidelines for a moment, it is going to impact people. and I think you've seen that more broadly. But zero concerns about Athleta and nothing but absolutely bullish in the same way we had been about what their brand has in front of us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randy Konik","Sorry, real quick, can you just re-clarify the gross margin impact from Old Navy versus Gap in the quarter. And then as we think about the annual guide change, we are expecting most of the disruption in the earnings per share for the year to come out of most of the second quarter or the gross margin, the primary culprit and deleverage from this lower sales. I just want to kind of think through or maybe versus Gap on the margin impact, and then how we should think about the flow of the year on the earnings front to the annual. Thanks.","Teri List-Stoll","That's a pretty complicated question Randy. Do you want me to send my model over for you?","Randy Konik","It's a little bit complicated quarter.","Teri List-Stoll","Sure, it's.","Art Peck","It's indeed.","Teri List-Stoll","So let kind of walk through how we see the quarter. We didn't get down to the specific margin delineation between the brands. But as I said, the Old Navy inventory situation did drive a level promotion that significantly affected the margin.","And as we've said before, and this given the size and mix of the portfolio, as goes Old Navy, so goes the company. And in this case, if you excluded Navy, it would probably actually would have had some gross margin progress on the quarter. So you can sort of take that for what it is. As we move through, I see Q2 being our next most challenging quarter given the start to May coming in with a little bit heavier inventory, and still having some of the lingering product challenges in some of those key brands.","Then as we move through the second half, and I realize the second half, definitely looks like a bit of a hockey stick, but you have to keep in mind we're comping a second half of 2018 that was not our strongest and so we're effectively when you model all the way through it, saying we're going to do about the same as last year in the back half.","So not a particularly aspirational goal at this point, certainly what we're sitting here doing is figure out how we can do better than that. But that is kind of the construct that we see with the back half showing the benefits of improved product, tighter inventory, better marketing plans, some specific programs in Gap, for example as we really drive changes we've been making in the denim program there.","So really driving those loyalty categories that have higher margin potential. So the back half should be, you know us getting back to better operation of the business model we know can win and that's really sort of how the construct comes together on the year.","Randy Konik","Understood. Any other nuances, that we should be knowing about regarding the annual outlook? Or is it just plainly, the $0.40 reduction, whatever it is, is purely just a lower sales and just all mostly gross margin impact item?","Teri List-Stoll","I think that's largely what you're seeing, we'll continue to work on the expense discipline of it, but it's always a challenge, right. How aggressive do you want to be on short-term decisions that hurt long-term health, and we just fundamentally believe, particularly as we go into the separation, and we want these brands to be strong and healthy, that we're going to cut back, but not do things that hurt the long-term health of the brands.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Sole with UBS.","Jay Sole","I just want to follow-up on the margin question. For the full-year EBIT margin, it sounds like that the - what was implied in the guide before was around the - so an EBIT margin is around 8% range, maybe now we're talking about something in the high 6% range. If we look at the impact by brand, based on the commentary you're making about Old Navy. Is it fair to say that that brand will have a bigger EBIT margin decline for the year than the other brands?","Teri List-Stoll","Well, I mean, you're asking me to get down to a level of detail, we wouldn't normally do. What I would say is that, given what we saw in the first quarter for Old Navy, and how we would expect with the start of the second quarter for that to transpire, even though we will continue to get sharper on how we handle the inventory movement, we'll continue to have that pressure. And just given the size of the business as we do that, you're likely to have a disproportionate impact on Old Navy versus what we expect to see in the other brands.","Jay Sole","The Navy part, if I could follow up on just some of the opportunities created by the separation, what will it mean for the type of opportunities and things you can do with real estate by having Gap sort of an imminent unencumbered from Old Navy and vice versa to give you some flexibility to maybe drive profitability or different improvement?","Art Peck","Yes, I mean I would go less to real estate because I think we're pursuing the real estate objective quite aggressively right now. And again, a big part of that is reducing our exposure to specialty, while continuing to grow the channels that we believe are the future, obviously including the direct to consumer, our franchise business, et cetera.","I would go a little bit farther upstream and just talk about our tech and logistics investment portfolio, where we see pretty significant divergent needs between the business. And we're already looking at those decisions that we're making right now, whether it's systems or capabilities, and thinking about how do we start mapping those decisions against the needs of the business as we separate the two companies.","Another place that again we'll talk about and I don't want to get out ahead of where we are right now, is to really rebase the operating structure of what will be the remainder of Gap, Inc. And this is something that I know Teri is passionate, I am passionate about it, we put it out there before. There will be, as we've communicated some level of dis-synergies, but at the same time, we're really going to use this as an opportunity to run the portfolio of brands differently to lighten up on corporate overhead, and brand overhead as much as possible, as quickly as possible. So stay tuned on this one, we'll obviously have more specifics.","Again, I would caution everybody that as impatient as you are, we're couple months into the work. We want to do this work thoughtfully, we want to do this work well, but I can assure you that we are also doing this work very, very aggressively. And I've used internally the expression that we're going to break some things, and I feel really strongly about that.","I do think when you're 50 years old as we are, this year, that there are some things you accumulate over time, that become very comfortable. And if you don't bring some things, therefore, the organization can't go back too, you aren't going to achieve the kind of enduring change that we need and that this opportunity of the separation presents to us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Steve Zaccone","This is Steve Zaccone on for Matt today. Thanks for taking our question. So we just had a follow-up on gross margin. Is your expectation for similar merchandise margin performance in 2Q, relative to the first quarter and are you embedding merchandise margin expansion in the back half or until maybe it's on better inventory footing? And then outside of your own inventory actions, what is your view on the current promotional activity in the mall, right now?","Art Peck","Yes, I'll start with that one. Nobody is in a different position quite honestly than we are. Maybe somebody got lucky and bought the quarter tighter or happen to have extraordinary marketing. But we've clearly seen promotional pressure as people have worked hard to get through the units that they had for Q1, against the lower consumer demand. And then on top of that, the Gymboree liquidation and other liquidations that are going on so promotional pressure is going to be out there.","We've been watching very carefully as people have come out with their numbers to see where they are in inventory levels to get calibrated on Q2. And then as Teri had said, we're taking a pretty aggressive approach towards our inventory levels in Q3 and Q4. I would expect that other people would be doing that as well.","The good news from our standpoint is that we can take those units out, but again as we've referenced before leverage our response capabilities, if we start to see places in the business where we can put units profitably back in, closer to the time that those units need to be in the store. But it was clearly a promotional environment and that is, if you really want to wrap a bow around Q1, you would say depress demand due to weather and aggressive promotions to move units to the system, and that's really the story of where Q1 came in at.","Teri List-Stoll","And unfortunately that is kind of how Q2 starts as well. So to your direct question of do we expect Q2 margins to look like Q1? No. We do get smarter with each iteration of this and so we would expect to be able to handle it with building on the learnings from Q1, in terms of how best to optimize margin, while we move through those units. So, that's really what we're very much focused on.","And we'll take that through the whole year, as I said we're very much focused on right-sizing our inventory buy and we were able to affect that to some degree for Q3 and certainly for Q4 to reflect the revised expectations we're seeing in the market. And so that should play through on the margin delivery as we move through the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Your guidance already assumes some declines in EBIT margin, I think operating cash flow as well. And so I guess I'm curious as you think about the synergies that are yet to come or if you don't see that hockey stick in the second half, does it make you rethink the ability of the organization with declining EBIT margins to the ability to absorb the synergies that might come what's putting things up, if you rethink things little bit, if the second half doesn't work out as planned?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, so maybe a couple of ways to think about that - and Art, feel free to chime in. As we thought about the separation, we modeled the likely implications of the synergies and the cost actually affects the execution vis-\u00e0-vis the value creation opportunities that it presented. Nothing has changed with respect to our assumptions there as we've started the planning work, there's nothing to indicate that what we thought we could achieve by virtue of launching these two companies with the ability to more effectively compete in their respective spaces within the industry, and that all remains intact.","So I don't see anything about our performance over the course of this year, that indicates that fundamentally the decision we've taken should be changed or reconsidered. We do have obviously the luxury of a very strong balance sheet, the choices we've been making to invest are all investments that we feel good about the ability to deliver a return on over time, and that's exactly how we view the cost to execute the separation as well.","If it moved forward and for some reason something changed with regard to our expectation for value creation or the cost separate, we obviously would be responsible and look at that and we consider, but we're just nowhere near that at this stage with everything we know about the potential for the business on a combined basis, and on a standalone basis and the ability that's the expectation for cost to separate.","Art Peck","Yes, obviously, I would actually start this with looking at the consumer, and I think that you can largely explain what happened, both to us and to others in Q1 by the consumer rationally slowing down her apparel purchases because of volatile and unusual weather. There are some other factors out there as well, which is we are in an environment, it's bit of a flat spot relative to a compelling trend, especially in bottoms that is causing her to get out and go shop with urgency.","We've seen those things before, they come along once in a while. Inevitably, they're overtaken by the fact that a compelling trend does come along and she wants to refresh her wardrobe. I think it would be profoundly shortsighted to question the wisdom of the separation of the Company, which we've looked at from upside down and center at every place else around the business logic of doing this, on the basis of a very, very unusual quarter.","If I thought, that somehow that quarter represented a fundamental overnight step function change in the structural profitability of this industry, that would be a different consideration. But consumers don't change their spending patterns overnight, this is evidently explainable and we are staying the course, because we are absolutely convinced that this is the right thing to do for long-term value creation.","Paul Lejuez","I guess, Art, the context is that - because I think this will be the sixth year of EBIT margin contraction. And so I guess, is there anything that you're seeing, if things were to accelerate in the back half that would make you take that longer-term view of what happen to the business, and think that you just don't have the cushion to absorb the synergies to take margin down further?","Art Peck","We're not going to do something that imperils the company, that would be irresponsible. And Teri will nod her head when I say that people that hearing the words cash flow coming out of my mouth, a lot right now, because that is my starting point for looking at the launch point for these two companies, and to make sure that we have strong cash flow and forward-looking cash flow out of both organizations. Of course, if there was something that caused significant deterioration that imperiled the viability - the cash flow production, the operating profit of these businesses, we would take a second look at it. I don't anticipate it.","To me in a way, as again, as I said in my comments, that you're noting of the continued divergence and the impact on operating profit, which as we've indicated over time has been significantly driven, not out of Old Navy, which has been largely healthy, but out of Gap brand, increases the urgency to get this done, because it allows us to maneuver differently and to operate differently. And if anything it's overdue.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Teri and Art, I heard a different strategy about the Gap brand in the first quarter, maybe profitability improved, comps fairly depressed. I'm wondering if this is something we should expect going forward that you want to lower the promotional profile of the brand or if we should expect a pivot in comps, as we move forward, perhaps you could talk a little bit about the strategy that you engaged in the first quarter, and what we should expect for the brand as we go through the remainder of the year? Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes, I don't - thanks for asking the question. I actually don't think it's a different strategy at all. I mean taking the decision to closed stores, stores were unprofitable and in many cases stores, the reason that they were unprofitable was a combination of the productivity of the store, but also the promotional intensity of the store. A lot of these stores are in places where the center that they're has become more of a value oriented customer, more of a promotional customer.","So our willingness to take unprofitable top line out of the business to restore the health of the brand, that is what we are committed to right now. We do need to lower the promotional intensity of the business. I don't know that that necessarily means that we have to take the kind of negative comps that we've been looking at over time.","But we are going to continue to push to restore profitability in the business, probably because we want the brand to be profitable and partly because profitability of that business and seeing a positive margin comp relative to the sales comp is an extraordinarily important leading edge indicator of the health of the business.","So I'm not going to signal what our comp objectives are going forward, obviously I'll be the first one to say I want positive comp. But more importantly, I want a positive foundational core to the business, where we're establishing pricing authority, and customers are paying us for what our product is worth.","Janet Kloppenburg","So are you confident that the new team that's operating Gap will be able to make progress on the merchandising front, so that the brand resonates better at a full price level going forward?","Art Peck","Yes, used a bit of a loaded word there, which is full price. The great majority of the industry is what they call blended, which is a combination of full price and promotional. Do I think we're going back to a what somebody tells me existed somewhere back in the dawn of time, a full price business. I don't think that's the reality of these categories that we play right now given the competitive environment that we're in.","And I'm confident that the team in New York through the merchandising strategies that they have through the tools we put in place through the operating discipline, the marketing, store presentation, all the pieces that have to come together that we can increase our yields. I am absolutely confident you saw a proof of that happening, what we're moving through units in Q1.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference.

My name is Lisa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Inc. Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host, Jack Calandra, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Jack Calandra","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.

As I mentioned, Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Arthur Peck","Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019m going to talk as I have in all of the calls that we\u2019ve had really about both the long game and the short game. And let me start continuing to address the strategy and many of the things that I\u2019ve been talking to you about and give you an update on where we are there, but then also obviously a deeper dive into Q3 and the prospects that I see as we look into this holiday period and Q4.","We are \u2013 I would say well into transforming and re-building parts of this company, starting with our product model. And I\u2019ve talked to you about the work that we\u2019ve been doing to enhance our responsiveness across all of our brands in key categories to pivot towards a much more continuous and demand based buying process to test our products in advance of the buys that we are placing to go into season open etcetera and continue to be pleased with the progress that we are making, but also acknowledging the fact that this is a journey and there remains significant work in front of us. First and foremost we need to win on product.","And as I look into Q4, I am feeling very good about the product that we have in our stores across all of our brands. Obviously the consumers will tell us how well we are doing and how well we did with the products after we hindsight the season, but if I look across all of the businesses I feel like we are in the best place that we\u2019ve been now for several seasons where we are lined up against trend where we have consistent quality appropriate to the brands, where we\u2019ve gotten our fit dialled into the point where it is consistent and where each brand is showing up expressing the DNA and the finger prints of the brand.","The second thing that I\u2019ve talked about is the fact that we are hedged down focus on ringing every penny out of the places where we have scale advantage. And that is obviously both on the product side of the equation but on the several billion dollars elsewhere in the company where we purchase a wide variety of things. And that is work that is not done, but it is work that is significantly under way and again work that I think has very significant pay off over the medium term.","The third thing that I have spent time talking about is the innovation in products. And again, we are in the early days of innovation in the ready-to-wear space but already there is good evidence of how we can cross [Indiscernible] innovation from the active side of the business into the ready-to-wear business and create meaningful benefits and have consumers connect with those product benefits in our ready-to-wear product.","A good example of this is the Sculptek product that Athleta introduced a few months ago, performing very well in Athleta stores as a compression shaping product. It\u2019s also a proprietary fiber and now we are moving to pull that into other bottoms fabrications including denim and to all fabrications. And the properties that that allows us to deliver in what is a traditional denim fabrication were actually quite extraordinary.","And so as we get this up in running, I am continuing to be very encouraged by how our consumers are responding to it, how we are delivering things beyond just trend to make the benefits of that product very meaningful to them.","Demand-base buying is a critical piece, and again to refresh your perspective we and many others have traditionally bought the year one season on a grand reveal at a time. And that means making large commitments well in advance of when the product is going to be in the store and well in advance of knowing what the consumer really wants.","So as we have been building the responsive supply chain capabilities, we have been also been re-engineering the front end of the business, so that we can buy on a much more continuous basis in many cases every month versus on a quarterly basis.","And again, this brings several benefits. We remain open as we get closer to the season and can pivot to buy it to the most meaningful trends and fabrications, but also we are delivering newness constantly into our stores which we know that our customers respond to.","Outside of the product initiatives, we've also talked about CRM and about the customer and about data and about personalization and about technology. And we're not letting up on the throttle as we go after those areas as well.","And you may have noted that in the last few months I created a new role in the company led by a chief customer officer who also has strategy, and that's really focused on bringing together every aspect of the customer across data, consumer insights, digital touch touch points and in-store experiences to create a holistic 360 view of the customer from which we can deliver meaningful benefits to that customer whether their benefits around loyalty, around personalization, rounded in-store experience a digital experience.","Mobile obviously remains incredibly important and we continue to see customers move from a desktop or a laptop experience to not just doing business on their mobile device, but really engaging the brand on their mobile device. And as a consequence, we continue to put aggressive effort against the mobile space, some of it is just the basics, but really important basics like continuing to improve site speed, how fast our pages load, allowing the mobile site to process a variety of forms of rich content that the consumer increasingly expects to have, we see mobile as fundamentally where our consumer starts and often times ends their journey and we need to make sure that we have a mobile experience that is commensurate with every other quality touch point that we have with our brands.","Let me move to China for a second, because it's fresh in my mind as I came back from a trip there just a week ago. I am very bullish on the long-term opportunity in China and while I will acknowledge that the fact that the economy has cooled somewhat, and the consumer is a little more cautious there, has probably impacted everybody's business it has not impacted my enthusiasm for the long-term potential in that market.","We executed a strategy and Old Navy a couple of years ago, where we put in place a number of stores across different types of locations, different store sizes, and we've been working that footprint now for the last several months in order to refine the four wall model.","Secondly, obviously Gap was the business that we planted their first both in the specialty stores and the Gap factory stores. And we continue to see that the customer resonates to that brand and wants to participate in that brand.","And third, the Chinese consumer is fundamentally an omni-channel consumer, and I remained very enthusiastic around an online business that is a significant penetration into the retail business and has very attractive economics.","A moment on Q3, and obviously Sabrina will take you deeper into the numbers. First of all I'd say the retail environment, the apparel environment continues to be challenging. Traffic remains challenging and as a planning assumption, we believe that will carry forward as well. We feel that it's appropriate to plan for that obviously we're doing work to try to beat that trend, but we understand the fact that traffic is likely to continue to be challenging as we look forward.","Given that, I'm actually pretty pleased with Q3, because I see positive momentum even against the backdrop of the Fishkill fire. And I won't go into the details of Fishkill, I will say just as a call out that I felt like our logistics team in this company did an extraordinary job of not missing a beat from the standpoint of rewiring our logistics network with our facility in the middle of the country and our facility on the west coast and continuing to keep supply going into our stores on a very cost efficient fashion.","A quick perspective on Q4. I believe that I said before, that we are well setup from the standpoint of the product in the assortment, just as a side bar again, we continue to move the needle in terms of customer reported experience with fit and quality, which had been very intentional initiatives. I believe, we've taken another step forward in the back half of the year and into Q4 on both of these dimensions.","We're also putting marketing into the business in a way that we haven't over the last couple of years, with marketing both in BR and in Gap, including TV for Gap. And I'm excited because now is a time when we need to start filling the funnel with laps customers and new customers in order to buck the negative traffic trend.","And well I've mentioned BR and Gap in terms of marketing; of course Old Navy is lined up as they always are in Q4 with a strong marketing program including the $100,000 a day giveaway for eight days.","So brand by brand, just a few comments. With Gap, right direction continuing to show stronger women's performance so I like to call out, because I -- the core of that business obviously needs to be a strong women's business.","In the kids assortment, we have a significant expression of licensed product, I'm very excited about, we have not done a large licensing business and particularly in Q4 we feel that has a lot of relevance. Old Navy, I think the numbers frankly speak for themselves, an excellent Q3 and an exciting holiday campaign, strong marketing, I think if you walk into an Old Navy store right now and I've spent a lot of time in those stores all around the country and all around the world, you will see incredible clarity of product message, you will see clear, category presentations there are super easy to shop, that's the feedback that we get from our customer.","You know the work that's been going on in Banana, on quality and on aesthetic. Customer feedback is that both are significantly moving in the right direction. We have a holiday campaign, including a catalog, which we have not done for years that is focused on reaching lapsed customers and new customers. And we believe we're set up to continue the improvement of the business there that we're seeing.","Athleta, I have nothing but good things to say quite honestly, positioned obviously against a very strong trend that continues to have legs underneath it. And again, Athleta is an active business. Athleta is also a lifestyle business, and that's really the core of Athleta positioning that confluence of active and lifestyle, which their customers very much respond to.","I haven't spoken about marketing in Athleta. We have a very connected customer there, the holiday campaign, share your light is a campaign that is focused on strong community engagement, which is really a place of strength for them. I expect Athleta to carry their momentum into Q4. I expect Athleta to continue to perform as we get into next year as well. Again, that confluence of lifestyle and performance is powerful.","Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge the announcement that we made a couple of weeks ago about Sabrina Simmons leaving the Company and then just a few days ago about Teri List-Stoll joining as CFO.","First on Teri, I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time getting to know her, time in stores, time with product, time across a variety of places in the business. And I'm really excited about her joining the team and the perspective that she brings from her experience. We\u2019ll obviously get more time to get to know her, some of you may know her already, but I'm very excited about having her on the team and looking forward to her joining in January.","Let me turn the Sabrina. She will be missed. I'm sure missed by you and most certainly missed by me, and the team here. She's been an incredible partner to me. In her nine years as CFO, she has obviously been very passionate about our capital structure, about our investment thesis, and just an incredible contributor to the company and in our relationships with the investment community.","In 15 years at the company, she's done nothing but perform in an exemplary fashion in every role. And so I will miss her, I want to thank her, I'm very appreciative that she will be here until the end of the fiscal year to facilitate a very orderly and structured transition, and with that Sabrina let me turn it over to you.","Sabrina Simmons","Thanks so much for your generous comments, Art. It's been a great 15-year run and a true privilege to serve the Company and our shareholders. Now moving on to third quarter performance. Sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 2% versus last year. Comp sales were down 3%. We were pleased that third quarter gross margin was up 200 basis points over last year largely driven by Old Navy. Merchandised margins expanded 220 basis points and rent occupancy deleverage 20 basis points.","Moving to expenses, third quarter total operating expenses were up $78 million to $1.1 billion, including about $35 million related to restructuring charges. Marketing expenses were up $6 million to a $148 million.","Regarding taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 45.2% the higher rate was driven by the impact from our restructuring actions, primarily in Japan. Our adjusted effective tax rate was about five percentage points lower.","Turning to earnings, on a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.51. The non tax-related restructuring costs were about $30 million in the quarter, this brings our year-to-date non-tax related restructuring costs to about a $180 million.","Excluding the tax and non-tax impact of restructuring, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60. Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with inventory down 4% year-over-year. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the fourth quarter to be down low single-digits year-over-year.","Our year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $415 million. Regarding capital expenditures and square footage, year-to-date capital expenditures were $383 million versus $505 million last year. Square footage was down 2% compared with last year.","With regard to our outlook for the remainder of the year we are reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 187 to 192 excluding restructuring costs. A few things to note about the assumptions around our guidance.","First for published reports industry traffic has decelerated November month-to-date. Second is Art mentioned given that challenging traffic trends have continued we are investing meaningfully in marketing across our portfolio of brands during the holiday season.","We are not necessarily expecting an immediate payback from these investments, but consider them to be important for the longer term health of the business. Additionally we are lapping bonus reversals last year which are also a headwind to Q4 expense. Therefore we expect SG&A to de-leverage in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Third, we expect rent and occupancy to be more pressured in the fourth quarter due to pre-opening costs associated with our time square flagship locations for both Gap and Old Navy scheduled to open in the back half of 2017.","Given all of these factors we continue to feel our guidance represents a prudent range. Regarding other guidance metrics we expect the negative impact from the fire at our distribution center to be just over one comp point in the fourth quarter.","Similar to Q3 the impact will be highest at Gap brand and lowest at Old Navy regarding square footage we now expect to end the year down 3%, a reduction from our earlier guidance of down two driven by additional gap store closures.","Regarding our restructuring costs we now estimate the full year impacted between $0.42 and $0.46 down from our previous estimate of $0.45 to $0.50. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.","Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack.","Jack Calandra","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Adrienne Yih, Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon. Nice top on the third quarter, Sabrina you'll be greatly missed and when you've been a great steward of the company, but even better you've been a great person to work with, so I just want to say that.","Sabrina Simmons","Thanks.","Adrienne Yih","Art, this is the question for you. I wanted to know what your thoughts are about that much talk about denim cycle, how you can play that at the Gap brand and when you might see a kind of some real impetus behind that that cycle becoming more prominent. And then for Sabrina actually you know with the loss of the unit have you thought about the business as you plan for next year and whether you could and should be running with far fewer units in order to get better gross margin dollars? Thank you so much.","Arthur Peck","Thank you. And I couldn't agree more first of all with your comments about Sabrina. I could talk a lot longer about that, but I know you have some specific questions. The denim cycle I would say is its clearly hit bottom and down stuff we've talked about that. It is an important part of what we're seeing at Old Navy right now and continuing to power the performance, and then it's important part increasingly important part of Bananas business and Gap's business as well. It's not as consistent as I would hope it is and I see that across the whole industry right now. It is clearly she's refreshing her closet but it's still not a strong dominant trend with super news out there.","Obviously with Gap will focus on that. Stretch in across all fabrications across the entire family of something that were rapidly ramping up both in the kids business as well as the adult business. But we're hoping there is more in front of us because it hasn't really hit our view that you know turn up inflection point where it's really starting to power the business right now. Sabrina, I'll turn it over to you.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. With regard to inventory, as tragic as the fire was, there were some really important lessons for us and that and one of them for sure Adrian is you know just when you think you're already running tight that you can actually run tighter and bring those that margin rate up in the margin dollars. So, sure as we look into next year we're trying to incorporate that lesson.","Now Q4 was obviously bought, most of spring bought, but as we look forward to summer fall and you know holiday 2017, I know the teams are really embracing the lessons from this fall and holiday, and very much are aligned in looking to continue to survive units very tightly. Now that said, you don't want to get so draconian that you don't give yourself an opportunity to positive comp. So are we walking that tightrope? But yes for sure it has been a really, really good lesson.","Adrienne Yih","Okay. Fair enough. Best of luck for holiday.","Arthur Peck","Thank you.","Operator","Next up, we'll hear from Lindsay Drucker Mann, Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good afternoon and Sabrina also you will be missed. Moving on to my questions, I wanted to ask about the merchandise margin improvement in the third quarter and how we should be thinking about the opportunity that sequential opportunities in 4Q, in other words do you see as much opportunity for merchandise margin recovery in 4Q as you had in the third quarter?","And then, secondly on SG&A, you had a bigger increase in the third quarter than we were expecting. Does that reflect some of those initial marketing initiatives that you talk about that impacting on the fourth quarter and maybe giving us some perspective on what type of marketing you plan to invest in? Thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","Sure. So, starting with the margin, we were obviously very pleased with the Q3 results. A couple of things to point out in terms of differences between Q3 and Q4 Lindsay, as we all know Q4 tends to be much more promotional and competitive than ","Q3, and then this Q3 of course was unique because we lost a lot of units in the fire, a lot of those units were fall fashion, so we were super tight on fashion in Q3 and that likely supported the nice outcome on margin.","In contract in Q4 we didn't lose any holiday fashion and threw it in the fire, so we still have basic and seasonal basics that were lost and supposed to be sold, but none of our holiday in any meaningful way was lost. So we have more passion in Q4 than we had Q3. Now if traffic improved and we move the unit as expected the time we wanted and the velocity we wanted then all is going to be well.","But as we mentioned traffic has started out sort of stubborn and still challenge. And so I just sort of feel like given the fact is too early to get overly optimistic. Although, obviously the teams will be driving toward that some improvement year-over-year, so that's the margin peace. With regard to the expense piece, there's lots of moving parts and expense. Marketing was actually only up 6 million and there were a bunch of other components some of which are investments for the long term that the company has decided to make.","Art mentioned for example the whole customer states and hiring a Chief Customer Officer and what comes with that. So, we are starting to invest them. And then as I've been talking about for some time since we're laughing many years of very tight expense management that it really gets super task to try and leverage unless you have a very solid positive com. Art, do you want to?","Arthur Peck","I think that pretty much said it all. We can provide more detail and marketing and probably not just to go into all the right now, but guess back on TV for the first time and it's significant TV presence we have a catalogue behind the Banana business, it's dropping right now. I walked out of the train station this morning to see a transit take over here which we're doing in a number of markets, so it is a it is a significant uptick in marketing.","And as we said don't -- hope certainly we get an immediate return, but we're not assuming that the case because we got to get the flywheel turning again.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thanks so much.","Arthur Peck","Yes.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So just a lot of moving parts on the expense side into next year. I guess what what's the best way to think about timing and cadence of the expense save. And then just with wages and some of the investments offsetting part of this how should we think about overall SG&A dollars in terms of moving forward?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. I'm not going to get into 2017 too much, Matt, because of course I'll leave that to my successor, but I'll tell you remind kind of the actions we took this year and the shapes that it should take. So the actions we took, we said, should result in annualized SG&A savings of $275 million. Some of that coming in 2016, but probably most of that coming in 2017.","Now what we said at the time is again after years of very tight management part of the reason we chose to do that restructuring is because it would help offset some of the natural inflation that you get running our business and would allow us to continue to be discipline in our operating expenses. ","We are starting to make some decisions to make certain investments in the business. And I talked about one or two of those already in overhead and people in the form of people and also in marketing especially in Q4 and we will talk more or the team will talk more about what those investments look like as we move into 2017 on the Q4 call.","Matthew Boss","Got it. And then just follow-up. At the core cap what level of traffic you need to drive a potential positive comp and if you could just talk to some of the underlying trends that you're seeing beneath the surface, beneath the comp in terms of AUR traffic, know just any green shoots that you're seeing in some of the new product potentially?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. We think when we started the year that we knew traffic wouldn't jump to positive. So we were kind of planning on a low single-digit negative and with that kind of number and a healthy AUR we could drive a positive comp. That was the plan. Unfortunately traffic has been more tending toward mid and high single negative digits, and that's really been difficult for us to get traction on.","Art can talk more about what we see under the covers. But certainly encouraging to see that women as a year has progresses it has been stronger than men. Year-to-date margins overall have been helping it gap. So those are some of the signs but for sure the progress has been slower than any of us hope for. I don't know art if you want to add anything to that.","Arthur Peck","Yes. I would just say that the part of the silver lining such as there was of the unit side of the business is it allowed us to really demonstrate and validate the pricing authority of the brand as we've tightened up and not have to move that many more units against the higher-than-expected negative traffic tend, so it's actually given us pretty good validation of where we are from product standpoint.","And then the other part of the validation is just the -- we have a close look to the process of understanding consumers perspectives on the product after they buy and the metrics there are moving quite nicely in the positive direction around fashion, around it and around quality.","And so I'm cautiously optimistic obviously for bucking as a whole industry is overall a traffic trends in the mid to high single digits and that's a tough number to look at it from the standpoint of pulling out a positive comp against that.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson, FBR Capital Markets.","Susan Anderson","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about the international business maybe just give us an update there. I know for a while Gap U.S, was outperforming the International, so just wondering about still the case if you've seen international turn a little bit better? Thanks\/","Arthur Peck","Yes. I mean the international business is obviously a composite of a number of different markets which have a variety of things going on them. Probably the most consistent theme obviously has continued FX pressure there and gap is more exposed to that as you know than any other business. If you look across the key pieces of the portfolio for Gap brand you know the Japanese economy has obviously been challenging for everyone.","We've seen some firming up of the business I'd describe recently but we have a long way to go there to get to the kind of performance we want to look at. I talked about China my remarks I don't really dwell on that, continue to be optimistic in the long run. but it's been I think probably the most promotional time we've seen in that market since we've been present with all relevant competitors both local and non-local breaking sail far earlier having sailed go deeper and longer than we previously experienced which indicates the miss balance of inventory and demand right now within that market.","And then Europe continues to be Europe. We've announced obviously the actions that we've taken there in terms of closing some stores. We have a very good online business there, the specialty business obviously carries a very good online business there, the specialty business obviously carries a very significant blood on its P&L and that's been an issue we've had there for a long time. So it's a real mixed bag. And then in parts of the business in Canada, Canada has been very strong for us. Its been very good business, so it's really a function of which market you're looking at.","Susan Anderson","Great. Thanks. Very helpful. Good luck next quarter.","Arthur Peck","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow, Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question and congrats, Sabrina best of luck going forward. Just a question I guess, the profit plan next year's was asked about and I think you're exiting the Old Navy Japan business. Just curious when you look at your portfolio across all brands and all geographies, are there any other maybe geographies that aren't really hitting their ROI hurdle that maybe even eye on that maybe you know down the road over the next 12 --24 months the business might look to evaluate as well?","Arthur Peck","Yes. I would say that when we announced the actions that we took earlier this year, we try to really get at the things that we have line of sight to in terms of them not being strategic or not having a place to get to the kinds of returns that we wanted to see. So I cant preview any other significant things that I see in front of us. Obviously we're living in a very volatile time right now and we'll continue to re-evaluate this as we always do on an ongoing basis, but I would like to believe that we got at the great majority of the things we need to get to over the course of the actions we took this year.","Ike Boruchow","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Tunick, Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good afternoon. And Sabrina, we wish you all the best as well. I guess are two quick ones, just maybe on the supply chain if you could give us an update there on what metrics you're seeing to help us understand the progress and maybe how much open to buy you have this holiday versus last year and where do you expect that to go?","And then secondly, on the share repurchase program it's been such a big part of the story over the last couple of years, so I know you still have some of that revolver outstanding, but has the philosophy changed regarding the company's capital allocation or minimum cash position? Thanks very much.","Arthur Peck","So, let me actually address the second one first. Our philosophy hasn't changed at all. We've communicated clearly on the loan that we have outstanding and flexibility there, but you've seen what we said about that before and nothing's really changed on that. We slow down this year obviously on share repurchases against the volatility of the backdrop and what was a challenging environment we just felt like that was the prudent thing to do.","A policy of returning excess cash back to shareholders remains pretty much intact I would say no real change and no discussion about changing that. Right now we want to just make sure that we can maintain flexibility as we see and hopefully as traffic firms up et cetera and we see performance stabilize we get a sense of how the various things that are taking place in the world impact the marketplace we'll come back and look at that as we go forward.","But I would say there's no fundamental change at all. We want to communicate with respect to our capital policy our cash balances or anything like that. Sabrina, do you want to add anything to that?","Sabrina Simmons","No. ","Arthur Peck","Okay. I'm sorry. With that that brilliant explanation of supply chain yes, let me come back and talk a little bit about supply chain. We'd really and this is why I said in my last remarks maybe a quarter ago is that we are continuing to move down a path and I'm not going to go into a lot of specifics because it just it's really category by category, brand by brand, if you think about demand-based buying, if you think about the response of platform et cetera and so the answer can differ to.","We're still buying one category on a traditional pipeline like outerwear, but in other categories like bottoms and mix, we have significantly improved the responsiveness of the category. We're making excellent progress and really more the challenge right now is the operating model of businesses and being able to exploit it demand-based buying as an example, we're building tools against that right now versus doing it by brute force. It's more about the front end of the business than really the back end of the business right now.","So, I've been pleased with the progress that we've made in our supply chain facing our vendors, consolidating vendors, consolidating our best class platform in fabrics all those types of things and we're doing the front end work right now, but this again is this is a season-over-season thing and I am seeing material meaningful season-over-season advancement in terms of these capabilities. Operator, is there next question.","Operator","Yes. We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson, Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Art you talked a little bit about the Gap brand and working on your pricing authority, I was just hoping for an update on how you view your current denim and tops prices at the Gap if you think you're at the right place and if any changes need to happen as you add more content to the product?","Arthur Peck","Yes. We're actually doing some pretty much, pretty deep work right now on pricing, so it's something that's really on my mind. We did some work at Old Navy which are now in the process of implementing which highlighted some pretty material opportunity and we're repeating that work inside of Gap around as well. I guess I'd highlight a couple of things if I look at denim.","First of all, if you look at where we are from the standpoint of both our tickets and our actuals, we actually play in a pretty narrow range. If you think about denim where it is. Denim starts in an $8 entry-level price point all the way up to multiple hundreds of dollars. And we really across all of our brands are very tightly banded. So I think there is a breath of fabrication, good, better, best if you want to think about that way. The Gap has an opportunity to step up to in terms of product development. And that's probably the biggest on my mind right now.","The second issue is we have seen where we've been able to have pricing authority, but it hasn't been consistent enough and that comes a bit with the quality of our buys and it comes I think with making sure again we're dialed in and on trend across the entire buy. I'm really focused on denim from a market share standpoint and that's how we're thinking about the company. And I've been very pleased with what I've seen it will maybe where we have been on a up consistent posture of gaining market share in denim. And down and we're doing the work both in Banana and Gap to make sure that those businesses are moving forward that way as well.","Again if I reiterated probably the biggest opportunities I see it is the breadth of our development and therefore how straddle where demand sits in the marketplace right now from a price point standpoint, and we're pretty narrow relative to where I think we can play.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Randy Konik, Jeffries.","Randy Konik","Yes. Thanks a lot. Sabrina it's been great working with you all these years and I wish you nothing but the best. Actually have a question for you Sabrina, if you think about the merchandise margin improvement, I think you mentioned bulk of it was from Old Navy. Can you give us some a little perspective on where we are in perspective merchandise margin cycles of each division, trying to get some perspective on where we are versus peak, obviously if we can go back to peak where we are versus more normalized trend across three divisions, and when you look at the composition of inventory I believe down 4%. How does that composition look by division right now? Thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. So, on the margins I would say since we don't segment report Randy I'll try and get some color, but mostly keep it at the Gap Inc level. I would say that I'm if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange which has hurt us for the last several years especially Gap brand. If you exclude that we're actually not at horrible levels. We're not at peak levels. So we're not at horrible levels of merchandise margins.","What I would tell you is that over the course of this year as you all know from comp reporting and our sales reporting, Banana has had the most pressure over the last little while. So directionally they're probably the furthest from peak and directionally Old Navy's probably the closest, as they've been recovering and having some good business. So hopefully that is helpful. With regards to inventory your question was around remind me.","Randy Konik","Yes. The overall inventory is down which is very good. I'm just trying to get some perspective on composition, a little color by division?","Sabrina Simmons","Sure. Okay. Got you. Yes, it's almost I would say by Channel, right. So we've been buying very tight in the specialty channel especially for Gap and Banana Republic given their tougher business. Old Navy obviously has also been very disciplined and bought very tightly. But that business is a business that moves units, right, there in the value sector so we move a lot of units especially this time of year. So they're probably have more inventory but from a historical perspective are also still bought very tightly. So specialty down the most and then Old Navy in our outlets to have a little bit more than the specialty channel I would say.","Randy Konik","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone. And Sabrina back of luck, congratulations, what a pleasure to work with you.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Dana.","Dana Telsey","As you were talking about the advantage of scale, and if there's work still yet to be done, when does that pay-off? What does it look like, does it differ by brand, and does that differ by front-end and back-end, basically for both you and Sabrina? Thank you.","Arthur Peck","Yes, Dana, I would say that we\u2019re -- I mean let me step back for a second, and I\u2019ll just simplistically characterize the work that we're doing, which is we've operated this company historically more as independent businesses with relatively separate the duplicative activities inside of each business, not entirely because we had a common sourcing structure, a common IT platform etcetera, but in a lot of other places it's been relatively more independent.","And the work that we're doing right now is to really build, turn the core operating platform by bringing all of those things together that are not customer-facing and then skinning that operating platform where it faces the customer and the brand needs to be expressed. And I've talked about that before, and that is a process is underway right now.","And certainly doing that from a product standpoint, we moved first in terms of product a few years ago when we moved away from a geographic base sourcing that worked to a category based sourcing network, so there's one office doing denim for every brand on behalf of the company where we can then bring to bear our scale working with mills and vendors in order to get the best possible cost and the best possible quality simultaneously.","It's been a bit mixed inside of other things as well. I think we have an opportunity especially in the environment we\u2019re in right now, from the standpoint real estate now relationship with our landlords. And then there's just a wide variety of costs, some media that we buy and have bought separately, we are bringing together etcetera, so I\u2019d love to tell you and give you an exact number, it is material and it will continue to progressively paid out.","I mean, I\u2019ve been very clear with the company on this one, that I want this done, I want it done ASAP, I want the benefits in hand and then we'll choose how much of those benefits we want to invest and how much those benefits we want to bring the bottom line.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Arthur Peck","Yep.","Operator","Our final question today will come from Oliver Chen, Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Sabrina thanks for the partnership and we\u2019ll definitely miss you. I was just curious about how you're thinking about enter playing marketing programs versus where you feel that your product is right now, in terms of you know balancing that. And are, where where do you think that the Gap brand, and where do you think the assortment is, are you happy with the alignment with where you want the brand to be an optimism and said or which parts of the assortment, you know have opportunity? Thanks.","Arthur Peck","Yes, where I think the product is relative to our marketing is, as I think Old Navy is lined up appropriately and it shows in the business. I think we have -- I think the product is better than our business right now in Banana and Gap, not perfect by a long shot, but better than our business and therefore it's why we made the decision to put some marketing into the business is to start telling the story.","You know I \u2013 when I was running Gap back in 2012, we fixed the product, we have a strong trend, and the business turned on a dime. Obviously I had hoped that that was going to happen here as the product better, it's not, it's tougher environment we are operating in right now with negative traffic, therefore the decision to put marketing into Q4 and to make sure that we are budgeting marketing as we go forward as well, really tell the story. And tell the story about all the product being on brand and on trend, but also about the restoration of quality of fit, of technical attributes, and those types of things as well.","I have a very strong conviction, that successful brands today our story made brands, it's all around us, and you can see the ones that are telling the story and the ones that aren\u2019t. And we have a great story to tell. We've just been a little too quiet with Banana and Gap. By design, well we\u2019ve been quiet until we felt like the product merited telling the story. And that's really where my head is at right now. I think, I will take \u2013I will take the credit here, we want it to be conservative on marketing because I did not want to invite aggressively invite customers back into our stores, and so I felt like the product was going to be where it needed to be.","On Gap rent specifically, again it's not perfect, but the clarity of presentation that you should see in our stores where we've really tried to tighten up to a category merchandising. The trend that we have in our stores, and I asked the question the other day of all of our brands, so I just send a note out over the weekend as I was travelling and watching and listening to people, I said, just tell me we all had velvet [ph], and we all actually have velvet which is super on trend right now across every single one of our businesses from Athleta, Old Navy in the intermix.","I feel like we're on a better spot, and we're getting better season over season as well. So I am not, as I said before, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic on Q4, and I will continue to be as we look into next year. Thank you.","Oliver Chen","Thank you.","Arthur Peck","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder, the press release which is available on gapinc.com contains a full recap of our third quarter results, as well as the forward-looking guides included in today's prepared remarks.

My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Incorporated Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O\u2019Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O\u2019Connell","","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. I\u2019d like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.","For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we\u2019re required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today\u2019s press release, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 21, 2014, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Before we begin, I also want to mention that Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investor Relations section at gapinc.com. Joining us on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Murphy","","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, who will take you through the Q2 financial highlights with Gap, Inc. I thought I\u2019d just give you my customary take in the quarter and also give you a few highlights of the upcoming quarter in Q3.","So, Q2 internally, we even think about the quarter as a quarter in which we made some progress, some progress on the first quarter, which we needed to make on a number of different areas, but it\u2019s progress nevertheless and we are committed to making further progress as we look towards the back half.","First, Sabrina will talk about progress on margin rate, obviously, an improvement from Q1, which we needed to make. So I think that that\u2019s a sign of some of the changes we\u2019re making the business to improve that very important line item in our P&L. We definitely made progress at Old Navy, and that was a really as very strong second quarter with a four comp on top of last year\u2019s six comp, that is market share gaining in really the most important sector that we compete in the value center, with the most competitors where ingenuity and innovation matters the most, I\u2019m very impressed with the Old Navy team.","We opened up three stores in China for Old Navy. so now, we have four stores. we have at least one more to go this year, maybe a second one, but that\u2019s a big milestone move for us, as we look at the China market, as everybody knows critical to the future growth for Gap Inc. We\u2019ll end this year with 110 Gap stores still on planned; up to six Old Navy stores, I think that combination of the two of them in the China markets can be very strong for us.","Our omni-channel initiatives continued to grow. we really saw some step-up in our reservations on a daily basis of Banana Republic and Gap stores. so I feel good about what that means for the second half, people are time pressed and this reserve in store is unique as a competitive advantage. so I think that that\u2019s really going to shine for us in the second half.","more importantly, we tested order in store, and as everybody on the phone knows about the ability for something to come into our store, we have the device us that\u2019s connected to WiFi, we can actually complete orders when something is not available in the stores, some things in a flagship store, which is on the flagship city, we get to that product. So that\u2019s been in Banana Republic, Gap and Old Navy being tested, we\u2019re going to roll that out to our 1,000 stores in the month of October.","And we\u2019ve been testing a loyalty program and what we\u2019ve been doing at Gap, Inc. for a number of years now was continually trying to find different ways and voices, something creative when it comes to talking about our value proposition. Let\u2019s say, so there\u2019s a bit of a promotional merry-go-round in marketplace until the companies are willing to be bulled, to be different to try something that\u2019s different in terms of offering value to people, but not in the way that\u2019s predictable, those are the companies that could win, and I believe this test we are doing in only 25 Banana Republic stores could become the basis of something we can use down the road to present a different twist on our value proposition.","And lastly, we have spent an incredible amount of time the last three months, getting ready for the second half and getting our prefatory work ready not only on product, but on merchandising, on marketing; on digital communication, on innovation, on customer messaging you name it. There\u2019s a lot of lessons of business learned in 2013. We\u2019ve addressed those as we come into the second half of 2014.","Some quick thoughts about the third quarter, which were two weeks into before I hand the phone call over to Sabrina, last week, at Banana Republic, we launched a new marketing campaign called the New Look, it\u2019s the beginning of enhancements in product and marketing digital content from now right to the end of the year and beyond. And I think it was a nice start for the team. I think they really made a change in terms of this past, the Banana Republic has been on from two conservative to more of a contemporary product appeal that I\u2019m speaking mostly about women\u2019s products.","I think our men\u2019s business has been strong. This is most of the women\u2019s product and what you\u2019re going to see going forward is a step-up in that messaging in the months of September, October into the holiday season. In the month of September, you\u2019re going to see a similar change go on at Gap brand, which is much needed, it\u2019s going to be a combination of push product put together by our merchant and design team of Michelle Demartini, Rebekka Bay, brand-new marketing campaign from Wieden & Kennedy, a big change in our online site to match up. so it\u2019s a fully integrated communication plan.","I just want to be clear that the store business in North America has not been as strong as Stephen wants and I wanted so far this year. And while we\u2019re both pleased with what consumers are going to see in the month of September is just a beginning, release that positions us in a much better way as we look forward to September going into the fall, going into holiday season.","Some other updates for Q3, the team feels a lot better about our inventory position on a per foot basis across all of our markets, which will bode well, in terms of the health of the business for the back half, in second half of this year, you\u2019re going to see the company push much harder into personalization.","And this is on our mobile devices, on our desktops, on iPads and we believe there\u2019s a huge opportunity here to personalize home pages, personalize content more than we ever have before, we\u2019ve been tested on the first half. and this is the ultimate definition of the use of big data.","This week, we\u2019ve relaunched Piperlime; we don\u2019t talk about Piperlime much. It only has one physical store, it\u2019s an online business. While it\u2019s easy to look at Piperlime as a small part of the Gap Inc. portfolio. what I will tell you is we use it continuously as a site where we test a lot of ideas. Ideas that can work for that business, because that\u2019s what matters first, but then can be taken to our other brands, and I believe the relaunch of their site provides for a lot of innovative ways to present our online business to customers.","Just a quick update on our franchise business, because the company operates in about 50 countries. It\u2019s been a unique year with some franchise markets, clearly showing some declines like in Russia, Ukraine and Israel. We have been very pleased with some long-term future markets like Brazil, Mexico, UAE with the strong growth midway through this year.","And as a matter of fact, as I\u2019m speaking to you, we\u2019re putting out the release sales, that\u2019s going to be opened up stores in India. In 2015, we believe the Gap brand has very strong brand awareness and looking forward to adding it to our franchise portfolio.","So in closing, I just have one comment to make. Today is the 45th anniversary of Gap Inc. and this was the in 1969 that Doris and Don Fisher, both spend $21,000 each of their own money to start this incredible company.","What I\u2019d like to say is on behalf of the 140,000 employees and millions of people who have worked in this company a big, big thank you to the Fishers. This incredible couple who founded this business, who make us proud every single day and I think that it\u2019s a testimony to the strength of our brands, of our people, of our creativity, our commitment to the customer that this business has been around for 45 years and continues to move forward and to blaze trails and be a formidable force in the apparel business.","We have one goal and one goal only. And I think Don Fisher passed away five years ago on September, would appreciate this to become the number one global apparel company in the world. And if we keep not being afraid to take risk, push forward the business we will achieve that goal.","With that said, let me hand it over to our CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon everyone. As we begin the second half of the year, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reiterate the priorities we set at the beginning of the year. We continue to focus on a balanced approach to driving long-term value. As a reminder, our financial priorities for the year are growing sales with healthy merchandise margins, managing our expenses, delivering earnings per share growth and returning excess cash to shareholder. As I described, the financial results for the quarter it\u2019s worth noting that all reported numbers include a $39 million gain on asset sale that we reported with our July sale.","In Q2, we made progress, again, several of our financial priorities. Specifically we grew net sales by 3%. Expenses were managed very tightly with operating expenses down $44 million including the gain. We delivered earnings of $332 million and earnings per share of $0.75 versus $0.64 last year. Year-to-date we\u2019ve generated free cash flow of $668 million and we distributed $802 million through share repurchases and dividends.","Regarding sales for the second quarter, total net sales were $4 billion and comp sales were flat for the quarter following last year\u2019s five comp. Total sales and comp by division are listed in our press release.","Moving to gross margin. The second quarter gross margin was down 110 basis points to 39.4%. This is an improvement in our trends from Q1. Merchandised margins were down 90 basis points for the quarter driven by elevated promotional levels at Gap brand. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. As a remainder, we need positive comps to leverage rent and occupancy and the threshold for ROD leverage is higher this year given our mix shift for international markets like China that have higher ROD cost.","Regarding SG&A, second quarter total operating expenses were $1 billion, down $44 million from the prior year. Operating expenses versus last year benefitted $39 million from the gain on sales. Marketing expenses were down $6 million to last year at $142 million. As a percentage of sales total, operating expenses leveraged 180 basis points versus last year to 25.2%.","Regarding the balance sheet we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re meeting our goal of better aligning inventory with sales in each period. Inventory dollars per store were up 2% at the end of the second quarter. We ended the quarter with about $1.5 billion in cash and used $364 million to repurchase 9 million shares, resulting in a quarter-end share count of 434 million.","Regarding capital expenditures and store count, year-to-date capital expenditures were $328 million. Year-to-date we opened 36 company-operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,200 stores. Square footage was up 1.6% compared with Q2 2013. Store count and square footage details are listed in our press release.","And now I\u2019d like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Our full year operating outlook remains unchanged. However, we are updating our full year guidance to reflect the gain on sale worth $0.05. Therefore, our full year guidance range has increased from $2.90 to $2.95 to $2.95 to $3. At its midpoint, including the gain, this represents growth of approximately 9%.","On a constant currency basis, the growth rate is estimated to be 5 percentage points higher or solid double-digit growth rate over last year\u2019s 18% growth rate. Underlying this guidance is the expectation that we maintained tighter inventory levels that are more in line with sales. At the end of the third quarter, we expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store to be up in the low-single digits.","Regarding expenses, it\u2019s important to note that there is no change to our full year goal of achieving leverage. However, as we mentioned last quarter, we expect full year leverage to be very modest, given the shift of about $160 million of income out of expense into merchandise margins as we discussed in depth on the Q1 call.","We achieved one point of leverage in the first half of the year in the phase of more challenging sales and traffic trends. In the second half of the year, assuming we meet our sales goals this dynamic will likely change as we had difficult comparisons from expense savings last year, and as we invest to support marketing, especially a Gap brand.","We expect marketing expenses in the third quarter to be up about $25 million versus last year. For the full year, the following guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. We expect operating margins to remain flattish on a reported basis. We continue to expect square footage to be up about 2.5%.","We still plan to open about 185 company-operated stores and close about 70 net of repositions. Store closures are weighted towards Gap North America and store openings are weighted towards China, Old Navy in Japan, Athleta and global outlets.","We expect capital expenditures to be about $750 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $520 million and our full year effective tax rate to be about 38.5%.","In closing, as we commenced the second half of the year, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the levers that we control while we work to deliver compelling product and marketing. Thank you.","And now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now open up the call to questions and we\u2019d appreciate limiting your questions to one per person please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our first question from Oliver Chen with Citi. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi, thank you. We had a question related to the Gap division. What do you think the next major hurdles are there to what we should watch for as you look to further move along with merchandise execution, and just as a quick follow-up could you talk briefly about supply chain and how you are feeling about fabric platforming and test read and react? Thank you.","Glenn Murphy","","That\u2019s two questions. Kidding aside, the Gap business as I talked about in my opening comments, I think that we can \u2013 if we wanted to, we could rationalize a way the first quarter which was a difficult quarter for business that has a strong U.S. based division. And that\u2019s been the division that clearly has been underperforming the most for Gap brand of all its global presents the U.S. has been the business that we\u2019re most disappointed. And second quarter was a bit of a carryover from the first quarter combination of product, and other issues in the second quarter. I think they\u2019ve made a lot of changes and people on the call and mostly our customers were going to be shopping that business on their device or in one of our stores around the world. They are going to see a better face of the brand from a product perspective starting in the first week of September much better communication.","So I don\u2019t want to get into the full integrated plan you\u2019re really focused on merchandise and I think you see some changes in the product and you start to see now what the benefit is of teamwork between a very strong and talented designer and a commercial merchant, not a product merchant, or a commercial merchant and Michelle Demartini who partners with Rebekka Bay. We see how that works over at Old Navy and its producing the results we\u2019re seeing now as we redefined the role of the merchant and make a much more commercial to drives the business and doesn't necessarily just pick product and we are seeing that in the early days of the relationship between our Banana Republic consumer of Julie Rosen and Marissa Webb.","So I think you\u2019ll see a change in the merchandising, but as I said in my opening comment it\u2019s the beginning, Gap had a very nice run in 2012 and 2013. First two quarters I said that you could explain and I\u2019m not happy with them, you could explain them. And now I think you\u2019ll see the beginning of the change in the first week of September take us all way through holiday, and not actually in spring and I think they continue to do what any good brand should do has deliver a better and better assortment every single season. I think this will be just the beginning in this fall launch.","On supply chain fabric platforming I\u2019m really impressed with how much progress we\u2019ve made. It\u2019s taken us a while to get there as we shifted our relationship from vendor-based relationships to mill-based relationships, but we\u2019ll have a significant amount for us of our assortment on fabric platforming in the second half and that\u2019s going to help us a little bit with cost of goods, Compare to the first half as the whole intention behind it\u2019s not only, finally the platform to run or respond to supply chain tools off of we can\u2019t run the tools without a significant amount of your assortment on fabric platform, but also as you consolidate your fabrics and create a much more tight library of fabrics and negotiate directly with mills that allows you to get the benefit of cost of goods.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thanks a lot. Best regards for the holiday season.","","Operator","","Our next question will come from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. McClintock \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Hi, guys, good afternoon, everyone. Glenn, I was just wondering, you outlined a lot of very strong digital initiatives, you talked about the reserve in store, order in store, and you also talk about personalization. Overall the digital growth rate for revenues is actually decelerated meaningfully from the run rate last year. And I was just wondering could you maybe speak to that a little bit, I\u2019m not trying to poke holes in a double-digit growth rate because clearly that\u2019s very strong, but the deceleration itself, what are you seeing in that business that\u2019s driving that in and when can we potentially expect a reacceleration? Thank you.","Glenn Murphy","","Well, a couple of comments on that, Matt. One, I would say, that inside of that double-digit growth rate, in the second quarter was poor performance at Gap brand, and then some of the reasons I\u2019ve just explained all of them earlier, I think they\u2019re just a matter of record now, where one is happy with our assortment in North America in particular or the U.S. in particular. But it was 11 on top of 27. So was it two-year 36. So that\u2019s 18% per year. Definitely market share gaining over two years, but I won\u2019t disagree with you. I thought we should do better than 11%.","Now, order in store drives business in the store and it\u2019s only being tested in 30 stores right now. Reserve in store stepped up in the second quarter, drives business in the stores. So even though those tools \u2013 I know you get the eyeballs from online, but the sale goes to the store. And I think personalization, what I\u2019m trying to say in opening comments, possibly wasn\u2019t clear. We\u2019re just testing that. It\u2019s been about six months we\u2019ve been in beta test, but we now believe that personalized content and personalized promotions eventually on our homepage, in our emails, in our messaging will definitely help online business going forward.","But I don\u2019t know. I think it was a good performance online over two years. I said if the market is growing between 10% and 12%, maybe I\u2019m being generous when it comes to apparel. Two years of back to back 18% is good, but I\u2019d have my eye on 11%. I won\u2019t deny that. That was a number we circled at the end of our P&L because we know every part of our business has to fire in cylinders for us to reach our goal. And our online business did a decent job in the second quarter, but we are always looking for strength, especially given your point, the investments we are making.","Matthew J. McClintock \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, Glenn.","Operator","We go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel \u2013 Nomura Securities","Great, thanks. Can you provide any color on the trend of the outlets, I mean for broader challenges across that channel?","Glenn Murphy","I think that it\u2019s a business that when the core brands are strong, they do very well. I mean, there\u2019s just this incredible relationship between the specialty business and our outlet business. And our outlet business did very well in 2012 and 2013 because our core business was stronger at that time. So, if certain malls around the country, mostly B malls, maybe the odd C malls start to act promotionally like an outlet mall that\u2019s 10 miles away, it\u2019s more difficult to drive traffic to the outlet mall.","I think over time, especially in our business, this is maybe a macro comment about the specialty mall business in general, as it becomes and needs to become more innovative, as it puts production separation between its outlet business and its specialty business, which is critical, as it speaks and engages customers in a way that\u2019s not so dependent on just pure discounting, I think the outlet business is in its right form and within our portfolio, was a critical part, a very important channel inside our business. I\u2019d say for that reason Jack Calhoun and Steve Sunnucks are really focused in the back half to make sure the specialty business gets to the right position on the continual mobile portfolio from Old Navy on the left hand side of the portfolio value based to intermix on the right hand side of the portfolio, which is luxury.","And for our outlet business, even though traffic ebbs and flows for it to be really successful, we need strong specialty business, brand recognition is there, but strong acceptance and a value proposition that is less baked in a percentage of as a tool to express their value, which is really the tool of the outlet business. I\u2019d say the last comment is there\u2019s been some new real estate lately. The only place that we\u2019re seeing real estate growing and square footage increasing as in lifestyle centers after being converted to the power centers, or being converted to outlet centers.","We participate in those we think is right, but for the most part our investment for last couple of years have been in urban locations, street locations and power centers as we try to make sure we stay in only the best outlet malls. But looking where the customer is going and where traffic is, there\u2019s a lot of street locations we\u2019ve gone into inner urban locations, where there is no crossover from a specialty store. We\u2019ve dropped in one of our factory store businesses having done very well. So, we\u2019re being careful not to just react that we did years ago to new square footage, but be thoughtful and strategic on how we spread our outlet stores across the country.","Operator","","We go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Amber Leigh Turley \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi, this is Amber Turley on for Kimberly Greenberger. So as you think about moving into fall and its promotional merry-go-round you talk about, what kind of steps are you thinking about in terms of easing up the promotions, but still maintaining a shopper, or are you thinking in terms more of developing the a better platform such as the cost of good decreases and maintaining the promotions to keep the shopper interested. What sort of lessons did you learn from last year that you\u2019d like to implement this year?","Glenn Murphy","","While, lots of lessons from last year, I think, have already been implemented and these are no word of importance, but I think that ourselves and my opinion is, a significant amount of the rest of the apparel market is in a much better leaner inventory position than they were 12 months ago, coming into the back half. I think that drove a lot of the \u2013 from that promotions what we saw in 2013, but I think the consumers feeling slightly better, which now we think it\u2019s good for the overall industry.","But whether the consumer feels slightly better about apparel comes up to how well all of us, but I\u2019ll speak for Gap, Inc., how well we bring product that they love, because that\u2019s what it needs these days, which have the incredible marketing that reaches out to them to them through all the different tools we have to speak about our brands. We as I talked about earlier, I think, was Matt\u2019s question, are going to talk quite a bit about the convenience in the back half, using our tools of reserving store, omni-channel \u2013 sorry reserving store, order-in store, other tools we have.","So we can talk about much more than the set of more traditional definition of a value proposition. I think the market we are investing and it\u2019s because we do believe we made some really good decision to the back half, I think, our marketing is much better. So, look at it as a step between product, channel execution led by online, supported by stores, integrate marketing into unique innovative ideas like our omni-channel tools, which are unique that be able to marketplace. And better inventory, work your way up and we\u2019re trying to avoid and only when necessary, how to play a more traditional game of communication customers as it was more predominant last year.","At the end of the day we are ready for whatever outcome develops in the marketplace that\u2019s what we have Old Navy to go out on behalf of the portfolio, gain shares it did in Q2, with a four comp over six, be aggressive and that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s rolled in the portfolio. That\u2019s to a previous question why outlet is important to us. We have those three businesses, Old Navy, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic Factory Stores, those are the businesses that grow on behalf of the Gap, Inc. portfolio and become more aggressive and play more of a promotional game and the other brands are to be positioned differently and that\u2019s the work on the work that Gap and Banana Republic need to execute on their specialty business in the back half.","Amber Leigh Turley \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis-Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good afternoon. Glenn now that Old Navy has rolled out in China, can you take a step back and just talk about where you think you have the greatest opportunity there, whether it\u2019s full price Gap stores, the outlets, or the Old Navy concept?","Glenn Murphy","That\u2019s a good question Lorraine. It\u2019s so early, I was there three weeks ago when the fourth Old Navy opens I'm probably just a little bit painted just because that was a big to do it was our fourth store second one in Shanghai, the first one off to a tremendous start and this one so far so good after just a few weeks. I would say that my instinct sitting here today was Old Navy will have a chance to go deeper into the country than Gap will.","The number of stores to be determined, obviously here in U.S. we have 50% more Old Navy stores than we have Gap store specialty. I don\u2019t see any reason why that couldn\u2019t play itself out in China overtime. Say may have a different view what matters I guess right now sitting here my view and I\u2019d say I could see that playing out in China. But definitely will be at for a GAP right now is in some let\u2019s call in for argument sake tier 4 and tier 5 cities doing well. Everything in China we\u2019ve uncovered so far is customers love fashion. It is big family play which obviously fits Old Navy and for Gap value proposition, but not discounting just being money not overpaying for quality, which is you know good definition of value which is important to the Chinese.","And as I think, as we look at that and add it all together, I think, we\u2019re super happy that both brands in our outlet business and the strong online business in China. I think overall, I look over the next five years, I can see where we would have more Old Navy\u2019s going deeper into the country as we planned on our real estate strategy.","Lorraine Maikis-Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jennifer Davis with Buckingham Research Group Please go ahead.","Jennifer M. Davis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Hi, guys good afternoon. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Athleta give us some color on how that\u2019s doing and maybe an incentive metrics that you\u2019re willing to share around the stores. And then Glen it\u2019s good to hear you talk about starting to may be utilized some of that big data. Thanks.","Glenn Murphy","You guys also bring Sabrina here too right.","Jennifer M. Davis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Yeah. Hi, Sabrina.","Glenn Murphy","She is firing at me. Anyways what we feel good about Athleta nothing has changed, I think, that the team has done a really good job, taking a business that was very solid. Now will get to we were joking other day, it\u2019s amazing how quickly we got a 100 store. So we\u2019ll get the 100 stores by the end of this year. What I like about it is, it fits in types of real estate, which is very important for brand, you thinking can you work in mall, can you work in a street, can you work in a strip center and we\u2019ve proven all that.","So online business is doing really well, we have all the metrics that say we go into a trade area, we don\u2019t have a store, when we drop a physical store in the multiplier on the pool of online business we do is very attractive. I think that it\u2019s in multiple activities, we continue to push that. So it\u2019s not a one-dimensional business. I\u2019ve also said many time our key competitor is Nike all those other competitors who get a lot more air time at the end of day Nike is the big player here and the person we look at the most. And where the share is going to come from Athleta, but its metrics and store productivity sell through it right, which is something we continue to push inside of other businesses.","Store productivity; sell through it like service scores in terms of the people and the quality of people we have. The relationship is it\u2019s our only business as we move to a seamless inventory model during the next couple of years has led over the years of seamless inventory business, one team overseas all of its inventory between an online, catalog and a store business. So we really get a lot of benefit under that. I said in the April Analyst Meeting and still believe that I think it\u2019s going to be our fourth global brand. I think it\u2019s earned the right to be considered for that, we haven\u2019t decided yet, but it\u2019s earned the right to be given consideration.","And lastly, what every business launch, but especially a business in the period of apparel is the trend \u2013 is their trend, right of the business they are going after performance as their trend, the new way of dressing is their trend, street wear everything that\u2019s happening right now. The women who are coming for the Millennial, so many things are going in their direction. So we are very happy with that, loved the team there and their leadership. So we\u2019re going to continue to speed and I got a very nice return on capital, which always make the two of us happy. So we are going to continue to invest behind them.","Jennifer M. Davis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","All right. Great, thanks. Best of Luck.","Operator","We go next to John Morris with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it\u2019s actually [Julianne Victor] (ph) on for John. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your product testing and your rapid responsiveness. I know you had some pretty big win there maybe earlier this year. So just wondering if you could give us kind of what percent of the assortment of each brand is being tested right now and what are the learnings and how you see it rolling out going forward? Thank you.","Glenn Murphy","We talked in April, the Analyst Meeting I think at the end of meeting I had Q&A, I think John was there that really was hoping that testing at a minimum, but also another important tool for us, rapid response would be a little more developed for the back half. Most of the benefit from the testing will come in the first quarter. That\u2019s same with rapid response; we have a little bit of benefit come in the second half. That was in the original plan, but the fabric platform work we\u2019ve done should help us on the gross margin in the back half of 2014.","I\u2019d say I\u2019ve seen every week I get a report in all the tests we do. So we just finish doing a number of tests across all the businesses for the first quarter. But it tends to point two; it helps us with the range bound of inventory, how big a buy. this is not a test of what the designers know what they\u2019re doing. We trust our designers. This is what there\u2019s something 300,000 units by 350,000 or 400,000. Then within that, it helps us with the CC component, and most times what it tells us is to give a style, or program at NCCs. You don\u2019t need the NCCs.","So we got to keep working on that. Sometimes, multiple colors have advantaged nicely for Gap, but it is helping us very much understand the size of the power of the buy of that style. And within that style, it could be unique actually within each style, but mostly, it could be color of printed pattern and all the results I\u2019ve seen are very helpful for the team. And we always got to apply commercial judgment and how do we gain market share to drive it, but the tests are certainly validating some of that and getting that a big opportunity Gap Inc.\u2019s P&L, which is what I just told you was that led us towering strength, which is units sold at regular price. I think this has helped quite a bit in 2015 on that metric.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We go next to Susan Anderson with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Susan K. Anderson \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us an update on how Athleta is performing and maybe there\u2019s any updates on growth trajectory. And then if you could also maybe talk about the landscape a little bit, that seems like a lot of players are trying to enter it and keep seeing any increase there at all? Thanks.","Glenn Murphy","Look, whenever there is, I was just saying to a previous question, whatever you have I think I described that the trend is your friend, a lot of people tried to jump in on this business. Now in fairness, Old Navy has been added for with their active line for about three plus years. Gap have Gap fit, they\u2019ve had that over three years also. So we look at it that Athleta is a standalone business that focuses on women\u2019s performance product and that\u2019s the first attribute, but as performance, but also as a fashion component to it.","So we look at it from a Gap Inc. portfolio, we\u2019re dominating for sure with Athleta, which is a standalone business. There are a lot of people get into the category, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to be successful. We really like how Athleta is performing like very much decisions that teams have made recently, whether that\u2019s on marketing, or whether that\u2019s in the assortment strategy, whether that\u2019s on real estate. And I think it\u2019s the \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a beautiful split in its business between online and stores.","And that\u2019s as for those of you who have been following, Sabrina and I, for the last seven plus years, we untangled some of the store decisions of the past. so we definitely promised to ourselves when we go into China, when Old Navy goes international, if we buy something like Athleta, we\u2019re going to take those lessons with us and make sure that out of the gate, we see how customers want to shop to find a better split between our digital business, and our physical business, and Athleta certainly, has a beautiful split in this business.","Susan K.

Thanks.","Katrina O\u2019Connell","Yes. There\u2019s always a little bit of a lag, because we place orders some months before, obviously they show up in stores, Paul. So it\u2019s great news to see cotton coming down, because of the lag effect, we would expect some small benefits, probably in spring. But assuming that the prices stay down as they have been, you see a much more pronounced effect in summer, which is obviously good news as we look forward to 2015.","Paul L. Lejuez \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. good luck.","Operator","And we go next to Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Barbara Wyckoff \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, everybody. Could you talk about the potential for store closures end of this year? how many leases are coming due this year and next? I think last quarter, you talked, Glenn, about gap may be being a place you might be looking at versus the others? Thanks.","Glenn Murphy","We\u2019re fortunate in some ways; I think the best math to apply is we have 2,500 odd stores in the U.S., so about 500 leases come up every single year. So that phenomenon plus the recession is what allowed us to do the work we did in the last four or five years. Going forward Barbara, I think, we\u2019re a little less focused on closures, although are mid too, there\u2019s always opportunity to look at stores that could be less about untangling this web that we inhered in 2007 and more about strategically looking at every single market and doesn\u2019t make sense on a physical presence. With our omni-channel tools, once I talked earlier about especially, with reserve in store and order in store, we\u2019re much more now focused about a physical presence does matter, although we\u2019re challenging as the size of the store.","We definitely decide about Old Navy and took it a lot of square footage in the last five years. But now we are turning to Gap and to Banana Republic, and won\u2019t talk about on this call, but in the February call we can definitely talk about some of the ideas we have for testing a different kind of physical space, we\u2019re working with our team here and bring the digital physical teams together working on our store going forward. It allow us to have a high touch store, lower square footage, and applying the current plus many more omni-channel tools to that store. I\u2019m hoping that will be a success for us is something we can deploy as we look at our real estate going forward, but great thing about the way our real estate team operates, we have a lots of flexibility.","Barbara Wyckoff \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","And our final question today will come from Brian Tunick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Brian J. Tunick \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","","Thanks, good afternoon guys. Hoping to get I guess an update on denim trends and how you are planning inventory there? I guess what is denim as a percentage of sales in the two big brands and how does that impact you are thinking on the timing of seeing positive comps. I guess that\u2019s the Gap brand in the second half? Thanks very much.","Glenn Murphy","","Here's how I look at it Brian. I would say that denim when you run the business in a portfolio for the American brands and I think you\u2019re referencing obviously well maybe in Gap. Those are heritage foundational categories for both of those businesses. To me this is where commercial merchants earn their keep, obviously understanding trends, understanding their brands, understanding customers and competition, let me just highlight one example.","So we\u2019ve had a team together of Joe Stenson and Joni Berger at Old Navy now working together, one a creative Director of Commercial Executive, and one a commercial leader on behalf of the business, and Old Navy did a four comp in Q2 on top of the six last year with denim across the marketplace negative comp and let\u2019s say where denim negative comp is that across the marketplace, what they do? They (indiscernible) denim was under delivering the marketplace they played a different color game, they introduced really worked hard on their fit pant, which is their active pant, really invested in that, got behind it, double expose that gave a lot of space online and digital content introduce the pixie pant, introduce the redesigned fabrication on the chenille pant and now where the first of our brands to embrace soft dressing.","And, when a commercial merchant works with their partner and design and figures out exactly that those trends like we\u2019ve lived through skirts versus dresses, we lived through knits versus woven is going to happen they have indigo denim and there is a little too much in the marketplace. If you can\u2019t understand the market, understand your customer, take advantage of the gain share then we probably don\u2019t have the right commercial merchants.","In the Gap business, in fairness to them, Rebekka Bay, who is our creative director have a lot of confidence and didn\u2019t have a partner for the first half of this year. And first part of the relationship between Rebekka and Michelle has going to be introduced on our September product comes in, that\u2019s our mistake by the way, that\u2019s not Rebecca\u2019s fault, that\u2019s my mistake, that\u2019s Steve\u2019s mistake, we should make sure day one she had a solid partner with her, because she runs six months with people, she worked with a lot partner to the caliber of Michelle.","So, let\u2019s see how they have figured it out and navigate, but this is what they do for living, whether it\u2019s sweaters, and holiday or \u2013 always understanding where they are going to gain share, is that where the customers at, how do they beat the competition ultimately how do we win. So, I think that we\u2019ve demonstrated that in one business and the other one not as well, that\u2019s why we\u2019re disappointed in our performance so far, but it\u2019s explainable, but I think you\u2019ll see hopefully an improvement in the back half as our tandem comes together. Thank you.","Katrina O\u2019Connell","","I would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.

As mentioned, Teri will be using the slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going onto our Investor section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Thanks, Jenn, and hi to everyone on the call, and thanks for joining us today. As we close out 2016, which is my second year as CEO, I want to spend a moment to reflect, reflect on where we've been and where we are and where we're going, both in terms of the work that we're doing but the overall industry context as well. When I took over two years ago, that's two years that has flown by, we and I knew our performance wasn't where it needed to be. We knew that we were in an industry that was changing dramatically. And looking back on it now, I think we probably all underestimated the magnitude and speed of the changes taking place. It's been pretty stark what's been happening over the last year as we've looked at \u2013 some competitors have exited the market. That said, we finished the year strong and Teri will take you through our results.","And I'm pleased with the progress that we've made, but we are in a market that is in significant disruption. Let me share a couple of truths, at least as I think about them, that are on my mind. First, the apparel market is growing, whether you peg the number at 2% or 3% or 5%. We're in a market that has long-term structural growth, has continued to grow, and that is a good thing.","Secondly, the market is, and we have clear evidence of this, continuing to move towards rewarding size and scale, whether that's vendor relationships that provide favorable pricing and innovation, whether it's us with a multi-brand portfolio doing business with our landlords to optimize our real estate footprint, or frankly whether it's our balance sheet and income statement where we see scale in investments, whether it's technology, innovation or other forms. But this is a market that is moving towards rewarding size and scale, and we believe that conveys us a significant structural advantage.","The third, omni, almost a clich\u00e9 word at this point because it isn't like omni is in the future. Our customers are omni today and that is a fundamental reality. Many of our customers begin their journey with our brands on their phone and they finish it in our stores. Many of our customers begin their journey with our brands in our stores and they finish it on their phone. And we've been doing work and we will continue to do work to really line up with where our customers are, not where they're going but where they are today. Again, I'm pleased with the progress, but we have more work to do.","Finally, we believe fundamentally, there is a significant market share opportunity. To read the headlines today, you'll see the words dead, dying, sick. We are none of those. We are healthy and strong and have a plan and clear direction. But we can all pick our favorite company that's no longer in business and when the lights go off and the windows get boarded over, that is market share that is made available to the rest of the industry. She's not stopping shopping. She's shopping someplace else.","A time of disruption means that market share becomes more fluid. And if we put what we believe are our structural advantages together along with much of the work that we've been doing on product and experience, we believe we have a significant opportunity to consolidate and gain market share going forward.","I've said it many times and I'll say it again, because it is foundational, we are a product company and we are a retailer. And if we don't get our product right, we will not win regardless of how good we are in digital or many other things. It starts with emotional product that she connects to that has the right quality, the right fit and the right value proposition. Two years ago when I got into this seat, we really approached product in two ways. One was some quick fixes, particularly addressing quality, aesthetic, the value and the fit and some longer term work that we've been doing where we've made significant progress. Where we have done the quick fixes, and they weren't actually quick because they required work, where we've got fit right, particularly in bottoms but other parts of the assortment, where we've re-established the quality that she is looking for.","Where the aesthetic is on, on progress and tracking with where our brands need to be, we've gotten credit for it. We've really gotten credit for it and you can see this anecdotally if you look at the reviews. You can see this in the performance of the underlying core categories where we've done this work and the customer has responded. It's taken longer and I expected, to be honest, a bigger balance out of this work. It was akin to the work that I did when I was running Gap brand back in 2011, but we have seen and continue to see the validation that this work is paying off and that she is reengaging our brands in a way that makes us very optimistic.","Then there was the longer lead time work. And what it really is is what I call de-risking our product model. Time is the enemy in this business. And a typical industry average development cycle has for many \u2013 much of the industry's history been 10 months. We've done the work now to get many of our programs and many of our categories down in some cases to 8 to 10 weeks. And, in fact, a third of our product across the company can be produced within the quarter. This allows us to buy differently and this allows us to chase trend differently. This allows us to manage inventory differently.","A big unlock here was to separate our core basics which we can purchase very cost effectively and efficiently from our fashion items, which have more risk. And we now platform nearly 60% of our fabrics committing to the fabric in advance, positioning that fabric at our vendors and having access to capacity to be able to cut and sew garments immediately at the release of a PO. We've also substantially increased our testing of product whether that's crowd source testing, which we now have validation results in better commercial outcomes or testing physically in our stores oftentimes in stores that are seasonally ahead of where we are so that we can use that to inform our buys.","Another thing we haven't really talked to you much about is the tools to do this. In Gap brand, which is leading the way, we're moving also to a demand-based buying model. And this requires tools that are different than what we've historically used. And historically the tools that we use to merchandise, to do inventory management, to do sourcing and costing, there were 18 separate tools that we were using to do that. And needless to say, some of them were on green screens and many of them didn't integrate.","We have moved now to one platform that can be used across all inventory, pricing, assortment building and in-season management and we're well underway for the implementation of that platform in the company. That conveys, obviously, a productivity advantage which is important for our cost structure. Most importantly, we believe that it really helps us to get the right product in the right place at the right time, to improve the outcome for our customers and to improve the productivity of all of our inventory.","Last on that front, and there's a lot more, but the last thing I'm going to talk about is the fact that we've been making significant investment in our logistics infrastructure. We've traditionally run as much of the industry has, with separate direct distribution for our online customer and retail distribution. We have the, I guess I'd call it the gift, maybe the luxury of having large retail distribution centers that are not fully utilized and the work that we're doing right now, number one, is an investment avoidance issue where we need to continue to add direct distribution capacity. We're actually doing the work to convert the retail DCs to be able to ship both direct and retail fulfillment out of one pool of inventory and one DC.","It allows us to avoid some form of incremental asset investment in new buildings. It also allows us to leverage and be very flexible with one pool of inventory. And we are part of the way through that. We have a clear plan for making that happen. There was a slight setback associated when we had the Fishkill fire, but not significant and we'll make material progress on that in 2017 and plan to wrap that up in early 2018. So there's a bunch of things underway. There's much more than I can talk about in this call. I'll look forward again to engaging with many of you as we spend time out meeting you personally.","Let me shift now to talk a little bit about our brands in Q4 and I'll start with Old Navy. As you can remember, we had a tough Q4 in 2015. And I have to give kudos to the team and, quite honestly, kudos to the brand. We diagnosed the issues. We made changes. We leveraged our responsive capabilities. We modified appropriately places in the assortment and I expected that really to take probably two quarters to fix and we got traction faster than that.","Historically, types of misses that we had in Q4 would really have taken a year. And it really took us four months before we started to see traction and the brand really getting back on track. That yielded, this last year, Old Navy's fifth consecutive year of sales growth and a business that is approaching $7 billion in annual sales. And I have to repeat it because I'm proud of it, but I have to repeat it, which is a 12% comp in December and a 5% on the quarter which I believe under any metric represents a market share gaining performance. This was driven by a strong commercial plan, cut-through marketing and great product acceptance. There was tough traffic but we beat the traffic, beat the traffic headwinds to deliver a positive top line by driving a strong sales over traffic. This was really what was happening with everything going on inside the store.","A few callouts. We emerged as the leading market share competitor in women's dresses on a rolling 12-month basis. And again, you've heard me say market share many times and I will continue to say it. Market share today is really omni-market share. Market share historically was square footage. As we think about market share going forward, it is omni and it is category-specific, and the entire company is moving in the direction of really being category market share focused. Women's dresses was a big win and we were able to drive very high-double-digit comps, not by guessing and buying into the category in a big way, but by feeding units into the business off of a responsive platform, really led by customer demand. It's just really the inverse of the historical buying model.","I continue to believe that Old Navy is very strong and our aim is to continue to invest in and build that business. It's a market share play. The brand is incredibly well positioned across family, fun, value and fashion. We have clarity of brand equity. We have a strong marketing voice, and really most importantly, we have operating discipline, which is big on by mind. You will hear Teri talk about that as well. The consistency and discipline is something that we have not had as consistently as we needed to across the company. And Old Navy really is the shining example of that in my mind. We continue to believe we have a winner in the brand with significant market share opportunity in front of us.","Let me turn to Gap. Progress has been slower than I expected, but I'm really pleased to see some bright spots and I look for, under the covers, period-over-period improvement in key places in the business and I have not been disappointed in seeing it inside of Gap. Jeff and the team at Gap are doing heavy lifting right now to continue to transform the product and the operating model. And probably the most important thing going on in Gap, again, is building on our responsive capabilities, moving to a monthly and demand-driven-based buying model. I would be remiss, however, to say that Gap, as we reported to you, is a very complicated composite of channels and geographies.","And I point that out because, obviously, we have a big business in Japan \u2013 Japan has been a tough market for many to do business in, a large presence in Europe and a growing presence in China as well as the North American business across the three channels and a franchise presence. So as I look at Gap, I look under the covers to see what the leading edge indicators are, product acceptance, women's business, et cetera, and I'm pleased with what I see. If I look at 2016, Gap is a brand in the relevant categories where responsive capabilities matter. They have moved the majority of their business onto a responsive operating model.","A couple of standout examples are the women's knit's business, which for Gap is a big business and the woven's bottoms business, also a big business, leading the way. By Q4, those categories had grown to high-single-digit comps with margin expansion up to 500 basis points. And again, that is starts with on-trend quality product, but it also sits on a platform of the responsive capabilities beginning to show what they can do.","I'll move on to Banana Republic quickly. As you've seen, I've made a change in leadership there and I've not yet put in a new brand president. I've taken advantage of this moment to really roll up my sleeves, get into the business personally and understand what's going on. Here's what I would observe. There's a lot to like and a lot right in the business, but not enough. In categories where we lost our dominance and lost the trust of our consumer and we put our shoulder against realigning those categories, categories like pants. Our for-fit (16:47) women's pants complex, categories like suit separates. Those categories we're seeing excellent traction with the consumer. Suiting is an example, double-digit comps with a 400 basis point improvement in margin, but we need more faster. And that's really what I'm focused on right now, which is taking the next steps and taking them quickly to continue to turn the business around.","I'm not pleased with the performance. I'm disappointed with the performance. I do believe there's a lot of potential in the brand. We don't break out Athleta, but I have to talk about it. I am nothing but pleased with the brand's performance and the team's performance. The customer continues to respond to the assortment, continues to respond to the aesthetic, continues to respond to product fabrications and the very strong marketing of The Power of She campaign. We are seeing continued excellent growth and we believe the brand is positioned in the sweet spot. Right at the intersection of performance and lifestyle which we, as a company, are very interested in, but Athleta is leading the way on. I'm bullish on Athleta and I'm bullish on the brand's growth prospects.","Now let me pause and I want to hand it over to Teri. I met Teri several months ago and we've gotten to know each other over that time period. We've been working now here together for five or six weeks and I would tell you that I just couldn't be more pleased with having her partnership.","I'll make a few more comments on that, but I want her to talk a little bit about 2016 and then the perspective moving forward.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Art. So good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by first saying how happy I am to be part of Gap, Inc. and its portfolio of iconic brands. As Art said, this marks my sixth week with the company and so far I've been extremely impressed by the passion and the commitment that Art and the team have around continuing to move the company forward in this difficult environment. Over the last few weeks, I've been diving deep into the business to better understand where we've been, the progress we've made and the opportunities ahead. I'm really excited to be in the role and I welcome the opportunity to help continue to sharpen our operational discipline and execute against our transformation strategies that position the company for long-term growth. For those on the call that I don't know yet I look forward to meeting you and working together.","Moving onto the fourth quarter and full year performance, starting with sales, our sales for the fourth quarter were up 1% to $4.43 billion. Comp sales were up 2%. Net sales for the year were $15.5 billion, down 2%. Comp sales were also down 2%.","Moving to gross margin, fourth quarter gross profit was $1.5 billion, representing gross margin expansion of 110 basis points to 33.9%. Merchandise margin was up 50 basis points with positive AUR at all brands. Rents and occupancy leveraged 60 basis points, driven by the positive fourth quarter comp and the benefit from certain restructuring actions. For the full year, gross profit was $5.6 billion and gross margin was up 10 basis points to 36.3%. Merchandise margin was up 30 basis points, and rents and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points on the year.","Regarding SG&A, as we've noted, we expected Q4 SG&A to deleverage as we invested more in the business. We also had an increase in incentive-based comps as we lapped bonus accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.2 billion, which includes the following items: $26 million of restructuring costs associated with the company's previously-announced store closure and streamlining initiatives; a $71 million goodwill impairment charge related to INTERMIX; and the $73 million benefit from insurance proceeds related to the fire at our Fishkill DC.","In line with our guidance, marketing expenses for the quarter totaled $195 million, up $26 million versus last year. For the full year, marketing expenses increased $23 million to $601 million. And for the full year, total operating expenses were $4.4 billion. Excluding total restructuring charges of about $197 million and the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge and insurance proceeds, adjusted operating expenses were $4.3 billion, $156 million above last year.","Regarding taxes, our fourth quarter reported effective tax rate was 22.8%. During the quarter, we realigned certain aspects of our legal structure to provide additional flexibility going forward, which resulted in a non-recurring tax benefit. Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 10 points higher, excluding this benefit, as well as the tax impact of the restructuring and impairment cost during the quarter. As a reminder, the adjusted Q4 tax rate benefited from changes in our geographical mix of taxable earnings. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 39.9% and about 1 point lower on an adjusted basis.","Turning to earnings, on a reported basis, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.55, and full year EPS totaled $1.69. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter and full year earnings per share were $0.51, and $2.02, respectively. Full year adjusted earnings per share excludes a $0.41 impact from restructuring costs, including the impact from a higher tax rate, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $0.18 related to INTERMIX, an $0.11 benefit from insurance proceeds related to the fire at our Fishkill distribution center and a non-recurring tax benefit of $0.15. Additionally, it's important to remember that foreign exchange negatively impacted full year adjusted EPS by an estimated $0.15 or about 6 percentage points of growth on an adjusted basis.","Regarding stores and capital expenditures, during the year, we completed the wind down of our Old Navy Japan business and the closure of a number of dilutive Banana Republic stores, primarily internationally. As we've said, these closures will allow us to better align talent and financial resources against our most important priorities in 2017 and beyond. On a total company net basis, we closed 75 stores in 2016, and our square footage as of the end of the year was down about 3%, in line with our previous guidance. Capital expenditures totaled $524 million, also in line with our previous guidance.","Balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with inventory down 2% year-over-year. Our full year free cash flow was an inflow of about $1.2 billion, including approximately $73 million of insurance proceeds related to the Fishkill fire. As anticipated, we paid down $400 million of term loan in full during the fourth quarter and ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash.","Moving on to 2017, before we get to guidance, I wanted to lay out some changes to our reporting practices. As we have looked at our practices relative to the industry, as well as our approach to planning and operating the business, we've decided it is more appropriate to provide additional perspectives on anticipated results for the year, while moving away from monthly sales reporting.","While our intent is to maintain our level of transparency, we believe this approach will allow us to focus more on driving excellent execution of our plans to strengthen the business for the future. Going forward, we'll continue to provide guidance on full-year earnings per share. We'll also add perspective on expected full-year comp sales, as well as full-year capital expenditures and store count. Where there may be other significant factors affecting our planned results, we'll also provide that perspective as needed.","In addition, we'll provide perspective for the first half of the year, specifically regarding EPS and inventory. As I said, we're committed to continuing to maintaining transparency with you and our investors through our quarterly and annual reporting. We believe this approach to providing guidance better aligns the investment community with the way we approach the planning and operations of the company to build shareholder value.","So, moving to guidance, as Art mentioned, we have an incredible opportunity to capitalize on the changing retail landscape to further differentiate ourselves within the competitive set and, importantly, to capture displaced market share. In 2017, we're focused on capitalizing on our improved product quality to improve sales with healthy merch margins; investing strategically in the business to strengthen our brand equities and to support growth for 2017 and beyond; maintaining our operating discipline and driving efficiencies by leveraging scale; and returning excess cash to shareholders.","With that mindset, we expect earnings per share for fiscal 2017, which includes the 53rd week, to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05. We currently expect that foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind in 2017. We estimate an impact of about $0.09 of earnings per share or about 5 percentage points of growth. This expected EPS range assumes 2017 comp sales are flat to up slightly. We expect net sales growth to lag this, given an expected negative impact of foreign exchange.","Let me take a moment to provide some color around the relationship between the first and second half of the year. During the first half of the year, we'll be continuing some of the increased investments that began in the back half of 2016. And initially, it's important to remember that the back half of 2017 will include the benefit from the 53rd week.","With that in mind, let me take you through some expectations for the first half. First, we expect continued investments in marketing, primarily at Gap brand, as we seek to leverage the incredible brand awareness that exists and translate it into top-of-mind purchase intent. Second, we're lapping minimal incentive-based compensation accruals last year that will pressure SG&A in the first half.","Third, as Art discussed, we're making investments in our digital and omni strategies that we believe support the long-term growth of the business. Fourth, as noted previously, rent and occupancy will include the preopening costs associated with our Times Square flagship locations, scheduled to open in the back half of 2017.","And lastly, per published reports, traffic has decelerated February month-to-date, which we have factored into our comp assumptions for the first half. As a result of these factors, we currently expect first half earnings per share to decrease relative to adjusted EPS for the same period last year. We expect the percentage decrease to be in the high single digits.","Regarding several other relevant metrics, we will, as Art mentioned, remain focused on disciplined management of inventory levels, learning from our experience following the Fishkill fire and leveraging the benefits of our investments in supply chain. Based on current trends, at the end of the second quarter, we would expect total inventory to be down low single digits.","Recognizing that this is a point-in-time measure, we'll be looking for sustained improvement and inventory management efficiencies. With our investments in responsive (29:58), we would expect inventory levels to decrease over time.","Factoring in jurisdictional mix of earnings, we expect a full year effective tax rate of about 39%. And excluding an estimated $200 million of spend related to rebuilding our Fishkill distribution center, we expect capital expenditures to be about $625 million. As a reminder, we expect insurance proceeds to cover the cost of rebuilding our Fishkill DC.","While the 2017 expected capital expenditures are above 2016, it's important to note our expected spend still remains below our five-year average of approximately $660 million. This spend reflects a balanced approach to invest in the business strategically to support long-term growth. About half of this spend will go towards store investments, with the remainder largely related to IT and supply chain investments to support our omni and digital strategies, as Art discussed.","Regarding company-operated stores, during the year, we plan to add 40 net new stores. Openings will focus on Old Navy and Athleta. Closures will be weighted towards the Gap brand. Regarding our store investments, we, of course, will be very thoughtful and prudent around these investments and will adjust the level of spend as needed depending on our performance and expected returns.","Finally, turning to cash, our priorities for use of our cash remain unchanged. First and foremost, investing adequately, but responsibly, in the business. Second, maintaining our commitment to our dividend, which currently provides a 4% yield. Finally, returning excess cash to shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to comfortably support our business. Given our bias to repay the $400 million term loan, we didn't complete any share repurchases during 2016.","That said, we have $1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, and based on our current investment plans for the business, we would intend to use a portion of that authorization this year. Our current thinking is to repurchase at least sufficient shares to cover the dilution from our option exercises. Our current plan would be to repurchase $100 million in shares in the first part of the year. From there, we'll monitor the business and make other determinations about whether additional share repurchases are appropriate.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Art.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Thanks, Teri. Really appreciate it. As I mentioned and she mentioned, we've been working now side by side for really six weeks. And one of the things that I saw in Teri as I was getting to know her, and I've seen in spades since she has joined the company is that she comes from a culture and a background where operating discipline and cost control are sort of second nature. But she also comes from a culture and a background where the power of innovation and brand building are equally second nature. And I said it before; I'll say it again, I'm very much looking forward to her partnership. We are both committed to ongoing cost control and we view many of the initiatives that we are taking as ors, not ands.","In this environment with the competitive turmoil we're seeing with the skittish consumer that is out there, having a lean cost structure is not just a competitive advantage, it's an imperative. And I also believe that in the environment that we're operating today, with the volatility that we're seeing, we would be remiss if we were not constantly grinding away at our cost structure and looking for opportunities for efficiency.","I do want to highlight the fact that underlying that, we are working very hard and are more done than not to really rewire the operating platform of the company. And what I mean by that is, historically, we had many functions that were duplicated across our brands. And we have been working really over the course of the last 12-plus months to bring those together in what I call a best-in-class and best-in-cost operating platform.","Wherever we can work on a shared basis and work more effectively and more efficiently, we will do that on a centralized and shared basis, while, of course, skimming that platform for everything that faces the consumer and everything that needs be expressed through the brand fingerprints and the brand DNA, so the brands continue to show up as the brands that they are. It's another place where, as we're getting that work done, we see advantage, structural advantage from our multi-brand portfolio as we build this best-in-class and best-in-cost operating platform.","Now, I've talked about market share a lot and I want to do a slight deeper dive on market share and I want to highlight the active and performance category. You all know that this business continues to grow. We have a very significant business in the space already, well north of $1 billion. It is on its way to being a third of U.S. apparel spend and it remains a key driver in the overall apparel market. It's a market that we're committed to certainly through Athleta, but it's also a market that we're committed to and excited about in our businesses that continue to build inside of Old Navy and Gap.","And one of the things that significantly differentiates this space versus much of the rest of the apparel market is technical innovation. You've heard me say this before and I'll say it again and you'll hear it again, we believe that there is a significant opportunity, particularly in the intersection of performance and lifestyle. A couple examples of this, of this proactive innovation are the Sculptek fiber and the Powervita fiber that we have in products inside of Athleta, which is seeing significant success in their bottoms business.","To further push innovation, technical innovation, we have created a small, focused and nimble innovation center, focused on proactively driving innovation at the fiber, yarn, fabric and chemical level rather than being a passive taker of innovation like we have been historically and much of the industry is.","We've hired a super-interesting individual to run it. His name is Tetsuya O'Hara. He was leading innovation at Patagonia and I think we can all agree that Patagonia has been an incredibly innovative company. He's just on board. We're really excited about what we expect to see out of this innovation center. And again, that's a center that we have not duplicated across many places of the business, but a center in service to all of our brands.","So let me talk for a moment quickly about experience because it's critical. And when I say experience, it's both the digital experience and the physical experience and, really importantly, it's where digital and physical come together. I want to give you a couple examples of the progress that we're making and what I'm starting to see in terms of how this can potentially significantly change the way that our customer is engaged with our brands.","So number one, we believe that as a multi-brand portfolio, we have a structural opportunity to exploit some places for experience that we have not exploited historically. Today, we have a loyalty program that is single tender and connected to our credit card. We are in the process right now of building out a multi-tender multi-brand loyalty program that will deliver a rich, mobile-delivered experience for our customer.","We believe, and we've actually seen results that support this, that a program like this can drive higher share of wallet, higher engagement, increased personalization and also really offer us very efficient, very effective direct communication with our customers. It's a path towards cost efficient marketing and engagement versus broad-based advertising. We think it's a win-win. We're in the middle of it now. We introduced our first Old Navy native app just several weeks ago and have gotten very good engagement from our customers and we're continuing to move this forward.","Let me give you another example. We, as much of the industry have, traditionally operated with a point-of-sale system that is hardwired terminal based in our stores. And we're largely complete in moving our POS off of hardware into the cloud and making it browser-based. What this does is it obviously gives us efficiency in the back end in terms of IT, but the most important thing it does is it puts capabilities in the hands of our sales associates and our customers on the floor that were never there before.","If you go back to Old Navy's Q4, what you see is a really exceptional sales over traffic spread. Not insignificantly, this was driven by the fact that we have deployed across many Old Navy stores the mobile POS which also has the ability to do stock checks, to do check inventory levels, to open credit cards, et cetera, and what we're seeing is when a sales associate has this, it changes fundamentally the way they interact with our customers in a very positive way.","Okay. Let me wrap up, and I just want to summarize here for a moment. As I look across the landscape and I've learned over the last two years, and we've seen the industry continue to change and that change continue to accelerate, I am convinced that winners will dominate in four areas.","First, product. If you don't win at product, you won't win at anything, and we're well on the way towards modernizing our product capabilities and de-risking our buying processes. That's innovation, that's quality, that's fit, that's on-trend every day.","Secondly, brand. Brands matter. Strong, healthy, relevant brands will win the day. We have some of the best global brands in the world, and we're working to make them stronger. At the same time, we're continuing to build brand awareness around an emerging brand like Athleta.","Third, unique and differentiated customer experience. This is where we're working very hard to solve the omni equation, to put capabilities in our hands that customers haven't historically had, to change the way our sales associates interact to make sure that every unit of demand in every place that it sits inside of this company, every piece of demand, every customer is matched with every unit of supply in a seamless, cost effective and frictionless way.","Those three things together, we believe, yield a significant market share opportunity. And then all of that sits on a disciplined, best-in-class, best-in-cost operating platform.","This is a journey. It's one that we're approaching with urgency, with determination. I'm a realist. I can see where we have made mistakes, and I can see where I can get very excited as the proof points begin to materialize. My money is on Gap, not only to survive this changing environment that we're in, but to emerge a very clear winner.","Now, let me turn it back over to Jenn and open up the call to questions.","Jennifer Fall - Gap, Inc.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call for questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much, guys. If you could just think back to what happened at the Fishkill campus and the learnings that you've realized in the fourth quarter of operating with a very different inventory level at the Gap brand and how that will translate into what's going to happen this year, 2017, by brand in terms of inventory level in stores, online and some metrics we could perhaps use in our modeling as well? Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I'll just give you a few thoughts, and I'll turn it over to Teri. I don't know if she's prepared to give you a lot of specific metrics right now that are down at the brand and channel level, but. I mean, obviously, we had a lot of inventory that was taken out of service. The primary impact was on Gap. We had a big impact on our online and our outlet business as well as the specialty business.","And I wouldn't have wished for the fire to happen, but we did see that with that reduced inventory, we were able to see really nice progress on some of the key metrics of the business in terms of AUR, the productivity of our inventory and that kind of thing. And it has very much informed our thinking about inventory going forward and the size of our buys (43:57). That all said, I do believe over the long run that continuing to gain market share is going to come both through better and more productive inventory, but also through units.","The other thing that we exercised with the reduction of inventory selectively was our responsive capabilities to be able to feed units back into the business where it was appropriate. And again, I've said this a lot. The vision on my mind is to be able to always buy conservatively and be responsive enough in key categories to be able to feed units into the business, like Old Navy did in its dresses business in Q4, where we see we have real upside in terms of unit growth.","Teri, do you want to add to that?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yeah, I would really just echo Art's comment and then translate that into kind of an intuitive view that there should be room for more efficient management of our inventory levels. I would guide it to down low-single digits in the first half. In my gut, I would expect us to be able to do better than that. I'm not in a position to commit to that this early in the game, but for all the reasons that Art cited, as we get better at our responsive capabilities and these systems come online that we've invested in, I would expect us to be able to continue to make good progress in inventory discipline.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, Teri. Just two quick questions. I know you gave us the 53rd week being in the guidance. But I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you let us know what the sales and EPS benefit will be to you this year in Q4? And then when you gave us the 50 basis points of merch margin expansion for the quarter, I just want to make sure that was an adjusted \u2013 on the adjusted gross margin. Thanks.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yes. So it's on the first \u2013 the last question first. Yes, that was on an adjusted basis, the margin guidance. In terms of 53rd week, we didn't give you the specifics. So what I would say is that on an EPS basis, we expect it to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.05. So about a couple of points on the growth rate.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lindsey Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about traffic and maybe just expand a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing in traffic. And how you're thinking about specific initiatives to drive traffic into the stores across the year.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I'm sure you see the public data and you could tell that traffic continues to be tough. We saw, as I've said that we saw a \u2013 we have a pretty consistent downturn of about 3% a year and now it's gone deeper than that. Sometimes we see deeper than that. The public data would say that February started out significantly deeper than that due to a number of things, not the least of which was the holiday shift. So we will have, as our backdrop, a negative traffic assumption that we're using as planning. We think that is appropriate and conservative.","Now, that all said, it's really two things, which is how do you beat the overall traffic number? And that is one of the reasons, one of the specific reasons that we are putting marketing back into the business. And it is not \u2013 a lot of it is not the traditional advertising. A lot of it is digital marketing that has a line of sight to returns. We can look and see how do we spend down on an ROI basis to the appropriate level of return and know when we're at a diminishing level of return from our spend.","The second thing, and it was really exciting to see was \u2013 and to me it demonstrates the relevance of Gap brand as an example, we had '90s Re-Issue Collection. And with a very simple amount of marketing behind it, we got 2 billion impressions out of spending not very much money. And it shows you, again, when you get something right in a brand like that that has ubiquitous recognition and a lot of love, how much you can get for not spending if you go out, craft it and do it in the right way. So marketing is really about being in the traffic spread.","I wouldn't underestimate also the importance of what's happening inside the box. I was in stores again this morning. And I like to be before we do every one of these calls and I am often in stores and there was a relentless focus across all of our brands to what I call monetize the footsteps that are coming across the lease line. If there are fewer of them, how do you do better with them? And it's why I highlighted the deployment of the mobile POS.","Old Navy drove a terrific SOT and part of that was by driving conversion in some of these stores. In some of these stores during the holiday period, they were bringing 50% of their transactions on the floor. And that results in a very different level of engagement with our customers and it's really one of the first times that I've seen, in my time with the company, when conversion, which can be just a relentlessly sticky metric, has moved in a way that is very convincing. So it's outside the store, beat the trend. Inside the store, monetize the footsteps.","And the last thing is, let me go back to where I started, apparel is a growing category and the traffic is out there. It is an awful lot of digital traffic at the end of the day. I've been saying inside the company that a headwind's only a headwind if you're facing in the wrong direction. And a lot of the work that we're doing is really about aligning ourself with where the customer is, beating the traffic trend in our stores, which she still values, and then monetizing the traffic inside our stores.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Art, if I can just ask just on February, do you think that \u2013 just as it relates to the broader industry, does the down shift in traffic or the very weak traffic trends, do you think those are explained by holiday shift or something else, or is something bigger sort of afoot?","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I'll do the forensics on February when we have February in the bag. I'm really not going to try to assign a coefficient to the delay of tax refunds and the weather and the holiday shift, et cetera. What I do know is that product acceptance when she's in the store, product acceptance is excellent for us and she hasn't stopped buying clothing. So I'm really spectacle that it's some big things typically don't happen in a matter of a couple of weeks. And obviously with Old Navy in particular, we had a super strong holiday and carried that strength through into January. So again, I'll do the forensics when we can look back and put a bow around it rather than speculate right now.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So on the margin front, how would you rank drivers of the 50 basis points merchandise margin expansion? Just the best way to think about the cadence. And then do you actually see gross margin up this year after we think about ROD and FX or are those offsetting factors?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Sorry. What was the last part of your question?","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Overall gross margin, after we think about...","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Okay.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...rent, occupancy, depreciation and FX. Is it flat, up or down?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yes. So you're asking for a lot of detailed modeling questions, and we'll be happy to spend a little more time with you offline. But just broadly speaking, if we think about the impact on margin, I'd have to go back and look at the exact ordering, but as I said, we're expecting some AUR progress, but we have the marketing investments and we do have the bonus accruals which are fairly sizable. That's a big part of what we're seeing on the overall margin impact. There is an FX impact. On gross margin this year, I think we had about 50 basis points of impact. We'll have the similar effect next year, so there are countervailing effects there between some of the positives on AUR and then the offsets. We'll take you through more detail offline, if that's helpful.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, that's helpful. Just a follow-up on the SG&A side. What comp do you need this year to lever your expense base?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","So on ROD, I think we said low-single digits.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Maybe low- to mid-single digits, I guess.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Best of luck.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participant. Our next question comes from John Morris with BMO Capital markets.","John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Really nice work in holiday, everybody. Nice improvement and really good improvement in gross margin or the margin pickup in particular. Art, I think my question's for you on product. You've said, and we totally agree, it's all about the product at the end of the day. So maybe tell us a little bit about where your team, your merch team sees the opportunity for the spring season for product. What you've picked up on, particularly at the Gap division and maybe expand a little bit more on Old Navy, but the opportunity for spring this year versus last year. Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I think the opportunity is going to be across a number of things. I'll just share some observations. And I'd encourage you obviously, as you probably do, to get out to the stores. I was in all of our brands this morning across the entire portfolio from Old Navy to INTERMIX. And I guess where I see strength right now, we're getting traction across the entire company in bottoms. And that is a really good thing. We're seeing that at Old Navy both in men's and women's. We're seeing it inside of Gap, and they have a very strong bottoms development plan going forward.","And as you know, to a certain extent, as goes bottoms, so goes the business. They are a loyalty category. If I go to BR with their for-fits (54:04) and the resonance that we've gotten across that for-fit (54:10) bottoms complex and then Athleta, which has had a super bottoms business, partly driven by their responsive platform and then fiber innovation as well, those are opportunities for us as a company. We're always strong when we have a strong bottoms business, and I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing.","I'm not going to \u2013 probably for this call, it's probably not right to go into a trend-by-trend assessment. Some of these trends are continuing out there in women's tops. Obviously, cold shoulder and off-the-shoulder continues and all the brands have embraced that. But it's really the strength in the bottoms business that gives me \u2013 it gives me confidence quite honestly, and the consistency that she has registered particularly about our fits across all of our brands.","John Dygert Morris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon. Art, I wanted to ask you \u2013 can you hear me?","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yep.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. I wanted to ask you, what has given you sort of the confidence to reinvest in advertising, particularly television at the Gap brand? And kind of along with that, the changes that you've made at Old Navy, why the operational improvement? Why have they taken longer at the Gap brand? Thank you very much.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I think that was two questions. Let me just...","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","No. That's no problem. So I'm sorry. I was thinking. Can you state the first question again just really quickly (55:41)?","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. The confidence that you've had to reinvest.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yeah, (55:44).","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Yep, exactly.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yeah, the confidence really comes from starting out slow, reading whether or not we're getting the payback which we did a little bit in fall and then in holiday, and then we put more money into it. You would have seen our \u2013 hopefully seen our ad that we had on the Grammys. And it's confidence we got through relatively low cost marketing vehicles where we're seeing the ROI. It sits on a foundation of the fact that we're connected to our customers and when our customers are responding to the product in the store, when they feel like it's right for the brand, it's the quality, it's the fit, it's the trend, it's the fabrication, et cetera, I've always said that that's the moment when you go out and you start to get a little bit louder inviting guests back into your home. And that's really what we're doing right now.","I was not willing to do that back in 2011 until I felt like the product was up to what the brands want and what we're really doing with our customers is saying, come back in and give us a try. We believe we have what you want and we want them to trust us. And we're seeing \u2013 again, it's not a go out and blow it up in terms of huge campaign, but it is building on some of the validation points that we've seen that suggest that we can get the incremental payoff by putting additional money into the business.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you. Can you answer the second part?","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yeah.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Time on Gap.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Oh, the time on Gap. Yeah. Frankly, the issue with the time on Gap, I would say, is a couple things, not the least of which was Gap had wandered much farther away from its core equities than Old Navy had. And I view brands, and Teri and I spend a lot of time talking about this because she obviously grew up in an environment where brands were paramount. Brands at their core are about trust and when we have done this where we have swung the aesthetic, where we've gone away from categories she has expected, where we don't deliver the quality and the value that she has learned that we stand for, that's a trust issue at the end of the day. And the deviation inside of Gap brand as we wandered away from the aesthetic and did some of these other things was much larger than what we had in Old Navy.","And secondly, as we said, also Old Navy's responsive capabilities were more developed than Gap's were. And so it's a combination of reestablishing the equities of the brand and also building the responsive capabilities out underneath. Old Navy clearly is also in the value space. The value space is very strong and checking right now. But I think if you look at those two things, it explains a little bit of the latency between the work we've done and seeing the results show up in the numbers.","Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Samantha Lanman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi. This is Sam Lanman on for Anna. Thanks for taking our question. Mine is on the Gap division specifically. I think you cut SKUs at Gap a few quarters ago. Any color on how that's resonating? Are there specific categories where you see additional opportunity? Additionally, I think you've talked about ticket and maybe evaluating ticket at the Gap division. Can you talk about that as well? Thanks.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yeah, I'm sorry. You may have broken up in the call. What was the first phrase that you used at the Gap brand? We missed it here.","Samantha Lanman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I was saying that I believe you cut SKUs at Gap a few quarters ago and I was wondering how that is resonating and any specific categories where you see additional opportunity.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yeah, we definitely had gotten over-assorted in the women's business. So if you go back to summer of 2016 as an example in the knits business, we had way too many CCs on some of \u2013 I think we have six knits programs which she really responded to, but we found that the color depth that we had across CCs was way more than we needed. So we've tightened \u2013 gone to these programs and season-over-season really tightened these things up. And that's another case also where Gap has really gotten traction with a category we call snits, which are knits but seem like knits \u2013 seem like sweaters. And so we've tightened up our traditional knit fabrication in order to create some space for snits.","It's a wonderful spot to be because it also gives us AUR lift as well. And frankly, she has responded to it. You see it in the stores. The stores are cleaner. They're easier to shop. They've got a stronger point of view, et cetera. I was in the store this morning at Aventura Mall and I haven't seen as clean a presentation of that in a long time, where the store was just clear what we stood for, the categories were well presented and it was a very easy store to shop. And then, sorry, I think you had an add-on to that question as well.","Samantha Lanman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah, I was asking about ticket.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Oh, yeah, ticket.","Samantha Lanman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I think (01:00:37) may be evaluating it.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yep. And we've done work now. We've been doing pricing work to really start with ticket integrity from a competitive standpoint and then understanding how the competitors and we play into whether it's a high low model, an everyday low price model or whatever. We're just getting some of that work completed at Gap and it's yielded some very interesting things. Overall, we believe that we have really high quality integrity in our ticketed prices. And again, that's work benchmarked against the competition from the standpoint of value and the quality that our customers are getting for the ticket. We are doing work and we have shown progress under the covers of reducing our frequency and depth and breadth of promotion.","If you've been inside a Gap store over the last three or four months, you would notice that we have largely eliminated our, what we call, POS events, where we go further in the store. And that's an example of continuing to, under the covers, back off of some of the discounting we've been doing. We have a lot more to do. I'm not going to kid you, but we've made some progress there and we have confidence. What we haven't done is any kind of wholesale re-pricing or anything like that. Frankly, we don't think it's necessary. There may be some categories where we think bringing tickets down makes sense in terms of competition. The work is also shown in some categories where frankly we had more authority that we've been pricing for as well.","Samantha Lanman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Just curious, within your flat to slightly up comp expectation for the year, can you give any color by brand what you expect concept-by-concept even just directionally? And also, just hearing what you said about the first half earnings, curious about first half, first second half comp expectations. Thanks.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yeah. So we're not going get down to brand-level margin guidance. Happy to talk about some (01:02:43) company drivers offline, but we're not going to get down to the brand level. As we said, we expect the comp on the year to be flat to slightly up. And that's based on our current expectations factoring in the start to the year and what we anticipate going forward.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sorry, Teri. I wasn't asking margin by comp. Just I was asking about comps by concept? Any directional color there.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","No. No, we won't go down the brand level. Sorry.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on SG&A. There had been about $275 million of cost reductions coming out of some strategic actions last year. As we think about the SG&A line, I know you went through a lot of offsets to that. But how much of those have been realized at this point and then is there an opportunity to have SG&A dollars down in 2017 because of those reductions?","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","Yeah, so we did begin to realize some of that savings in the current year. So we haven't disclosed the specific amounts, but a meaningful portion of those were realized this year and the remainder will be realized next year. Those are largely offset \u2013 more than offset by the investments that we're making than we talked about in terms of the digital capability and then the advertising spend. So you're not going to see a reduction in SG&A. You'll actually see some growth and it's just a bit of a lagging as we make these investments and then we'll start to see the benefits come as we move forward.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","I would just jump in there also and say, reiterate the comments I made. I know Teri feels the same way. We're never done on looking for opportunities for efficiency inside the company. One of the reasons I really welcome Teri's eyes, one of the many, is a fresh pair of eyes sees opportunities that we may not have seen sitting here. And so, that is very much on my mind. And I'm not previewing anything in terms of another cost restructuring or something like that, but I remain convinced that we have to continue to get to a lean cost structure as I said.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the store base and the footprint, you mentioned about the net openings. What do the closings look like by brand? And how do you think about the store footprint over time? What do you want it to look like? Thank you.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","So we do have some planned closings. I don't think we've disclosed the specifics, but they're largely associated with Gap following on some of the programs that we had this year. We had closings in BR International largely and Gap. So there will be two additional closings next year.","Arthur L. Peck - Gap, Inc.","And the other side of it is, Dana, and it's nice to hear from you, I view Old Navy as an opportunity to incrementally open some additional stores. We have some infill opportunity there. We're experimenting with a small store format. So, that number, as you know, is a net and it's a very different story if you look at an Old Navy or an Athleta versus Gap on the other side of the equation.","Teri L. List-Stoll - Gap, Inc.","The last thing, not unlike inventory and SG&A where Art said, we'll be looking at everything with a fresh set of eyes. The real estate footprint is the other thing that we need to look at over time and we'll continue to think about whether we have the right locations and in the best footprint overall.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participant [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","Tina Romani","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap, Inc.'s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as the description and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, as noted on page two of the slides supplementing Teri's remarks, please refer to today's earnings press release, as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com.

As mentioned, we will be using slides to supplement our remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors sections at gapinc.com. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Art Peck","Hi, everybody, and thanks for joining us for the call today. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. You know, our quarterly results came in largely as we expected them to, and we are positioned for continued improvements in the back-half of the year.","Today I will talk through some key highlights, and Teri will, as always, follow-up the detailed results for the quarter and guidance for the remainder of the year. But before we discuss the performance of each brand, I would like to pull us up for a moment and talk just a bit about a broader view of our foundational assets.","First, on our supply chain, and I'm not going to dwell on this for a long time today, but this has been a huge focus of mine from the moment I stepped into this role. And we have made huge strides forward in terms of responsiveness, platforming, testing, vendor consolidation, quality improvement, and product cost. There is no question that this is an important factor powering Old Navy's consistency, Athleta's growth, and Banana's continued turnaround. These are real capabilities driving real outcomes.","Second, and I have to be honest here, it perplexes me to continue to hear over and over that stores are a liability. They are an asset, not a liability. Sure, and if you have got a store in a dying mall, that store needs to go away, and that's the work that we have got on early, and we will continue. But the simple factor is that most apparel is still sold in stores, and will continue to be sold in stores. That said, the definition of shopping continues to change. She wants to do more than just walk in, pick a product, and exit. She wants to find something online and pick it up in a store, be checked out in the fitting room, will place an online order in a store. It's important to continue to emphasize that we are delivering a suite of capabilities for her to shop and engage our brands today the way that she wants to. Stores are the deepest form of customer engagement. And one thing the industry is not talking about, which is super important to me is that they are source of an immense amount of customer data. I will come back to that.","And we are bringing technology to bear to solve some old-fashioned problems; simple things like I can't find my size, style, color combination. This not being able to find your size is one of the customer's biggest frustrations, and to address it, we just rolled out what we call an In-Stock On-Shelf app, which informs proactively the store associates on their mobile device when items need replenishing. I think about it as we are getting the benefits of RFID without the expense and hassle of RFID.","After deploying the solution in all U.S. Gap stores, the rate at which an item is available in the store but not on the floor, decreased from 40% to just 1%. This satisfies the customer, drives conversion, and increases labor productivity. It's a win-win-win. So far we have also rolled out this solution for a select category at Old Navy with full fleet rollouts planned for Athleta and Banana Republic in the second-half of the year.","In another example of how we are taking friction out of the shopping experience, this quarter Old Navy rolled out Buy Online Pick up in Store, or BOPS, nationwide, and we have seen customers using it, and quite honestly, absolutely loving it. Early response has been super positive with about 20% of the customers making additional purchases once they are in the store, and nearly 20% of the customers using the service were customers new to a multi-channel experience, meaning they previously had shopped either online or in-store, but not in both. We know the value of a multi-channel consumer, and this behavior results in a more loyal, more valuable customer.","Beyond driving highly qualified traffic into our stores, there's also an important accretive effect on the P&L.","When online is integrated into the in-store shopping experience, we get the margin benefit above the line of the profitability of the online business without the variable shipping experience below the line, because we are leveraging our store footprint. Most importantly, it is profitably, I would underline, giving our customers exactly what she wants, and while it's still early, Buy Online and Pickup in Store is one of the levers that we expect to support continued top and bottom-line expansion in Old Navy, and is a building block in our back-half growth plan.","We also continue to improve our mobile app experience, and this is important, because she's not just using this at home, she's using it in our stores. This quarter we launched a scanning feature within the app that lets the customers easily scan a barcode to read reviews, find additional sizes and colors, and if the item isn't available in her size or color in the store, then have it shipped to her home. This work is driving increased customer engagement and sales via the mobile app in the first-half of the year more than doubled compared to the first-half of last year.","All the above demonstrates how we continue to and have brought our stores together with our third asset, our large fast-growing and very profitable online business. That business cost crossed the market $3 billion last year. We're on track to reach $3.5 billion this year, and we've taken investments capability, technology and training to deliver a seamless, low friction, high-touch and cost-effective experience to our customers regardless of where she shops. We're actually a leader at this. It's driving our growth and our profitability, and we believe we are just getting started in seeing the economic and customer benefits.","Now let's talk about our fourth asset, which is again largely not talked about. I sit here on the Bay area surrounded by new economy companies who entire business model is data. They know that data is a scale asset and the more that you have, the more value you can extract. Because of our size and our scale, we have an immensely valuable data asset that we're just beginning to exploit. We have two billion customer visits across our brands and channels. We have a co-branded and private label credit card that gives us great intimacy with those customers. We have customer information capture incented in our stores, and in the subset of our brands and stores we have client telling. The value of converting all of this data to insight and action is huge. A simple example is that migrating just 1% of our single-visit customers to be multi-channel, multi-brand represents $200 million of top line on an annual basis.","One way we're doing this that is encouraging our customers shop across our brands and channels is through a multi-tender loyalty built on the back of our data assets called BRIGHT. This quarter we expanded the program across all brands in California, and the early results have been very positive with over a million new members, and will continue to test and expand as we gain experience in how to best optimize and frankly monetize this program.","In addition to BRIGHT, we have many other efforts underway to leverage our data assets and to maximize the lifetime value of our customers. I'll take a moment to highlight just a handful. We now have a longitudinal 360 view of our customers through data and analytics. We're leveraging this into personalization to create a more relevant digital experience. The rollout of personalization features across our brands is being staggered as we continue to learn more and operationalize it, but we have already deployed personalized experiences to over 250 customer segments, which has resulted in a 5% improvement in conversion when compared to a non-personalized experience.","We're also using data and knowledge of our best customers and have moved the majority of our marketing spend into digital channels where we can be surgical in acquisition, activation, retention, and frequency. It's driving a growth in our customer file, growth in our traffic and growth in our business. And it's improving the productivity of our marketing spend at the same time.","To sum it up, I see our supply chain as a powerful, scaled, fundamental asset that is key to our sustained growth. Our stores are another asset, they're still where the majority of purchases are made and they allow us to engage with our customers in deeply personal ways. Our digital business is large and only getting larger and finally the combination of our stores and our online business generate an immense and powerful data asset that we're only beginning to exploit.","Now let me turn to the performance of our brands beginning with our growth brands Old Navy and Athleta. Old Navy grew market share again this quarter and in Q2 as the eighth largest apparel retailer, second largest apparel brand in the United States. We're seeing incredible strength in brand health metrics and Old Navy is continuing to pace towards our $10 billion net sales goal. The store traffic outpacing the industry and up again for the quarter. We're also seeing great traction in our new and remodeled stores. We've told you this was a priority and we continue to pursue it and year-to-date, we've opened 28 stores and completed 85 remodels. As a whole, new store performance is beating expectations and remodels are outperforming the fleet by an average spread of five comp points.","Old Navy's product engine continues to be the foundation of its success. The process is rock solid and is key to delivering consistency in the business. Once again, we saw a broad-based strength across nearly every category with all divisions gaining market share during the quarter and remain a market share leader in dresses, knits, shorts, and pants.","Super exciting news, and we announced this just a couple of days ago which is that Old Navy will be launching its plus collection previously only available and smaller online into 75 select stores. For some context, the women's plus-size market is north of $20 billion and is growing above the rate of the overall apparel market. Old Navy has a strong foundation in this business with a dedicated plus collection that has been available online for over 14 years. NPD says that even with just the online business Old Navy falls within the top 10 women's plus-size brands and expansion of the category in the stores represents, we believe, a significant growth opportunity and is in line with Old Navy's inclusive democratic brand values, or as we put it, and I would encourage you to check this out, #SizeYES.","Let's move to Athleta which delivered another market share gaining quarter and is progressing well against our $1 billion sales objective. This brand continues to excel in engaging and connecting with new and existing customers and in Q2 the new customer growth rate continued to accelerate, a sign of a healthy, solid growth brand. No brand is perfect, and Athleta did see some softness in swim this quarter. The good news is that we're largely out of the category for the back half and from an execution perspective, we used our responsive capabilities to pivot in-season to the high growth bottoms business. In fact, the bottoms business, which represents nearly half of the assortment, delivered a high-teens comp during the quarter.","Performance within the girls business has been nothing less than phenomenal, and they're playing in the back-to-school space this year. The brand recently released their Stay in the Game campaign emphasizing girls' confidence building through sports and activities. I really encourage you to look at the video, which powerfully captures everything the brand stands for and how Athleta deeply engages with their customers.","Now let's move to our more mature profit focused brands beginning with Banana Republic. The work the team has done to restore brand health is paying off and I'm seeing that in the numbers, this was Banana's third consecutive quarter of positive comp and very importantly, that comp was coupled with healthy margins. I would encourage all of you to get into the stores and to see what the assortment looks like. It is more consistent and it is better executed and our customers are responding.","Taking a page from the Old Navy playbook, we've shifted to an occasion and event driven strategy with cohesive product, marketing and commercial plans all focused on the customer. I'm quite encouraged by the momentum we're seeing and the team is heads down focused on continuing to drive the business in the back half of the year.","Finally, Gap; in June, we announced that Neil Fiske would join our team as President and CEO of Gap brand. In the short six weeks time, I'm impressed with his ability to take the baton and run. He's completely focused on stabilizing the business and simultaneously improving operating discipline.","The Q2 comp trend in Gap brand was unacceptable, but it reflects a conscious choice to optimize margin dollars as we continue to manage through inventory. We were able to cut 30% styles in CCs for the second-half. And in hindsight, we believe this is very much the right decision, but it has left us with some imbalances heading into the fall. As I have said, we will see continued improvement at Gap brand as we move through the year, and that remains the view. Quarter-by-quarter, we expect performance to improve, and we believe the worst is behind us.","Lastly, I want to spend a couple of minutes on productivity, and Teri will talk about it in a little more detail; actually just a few seconds on productivity, because I need to turn it over to her. We delivered the second quarter of improved SG&A trends, and we are on track to exceed our internal productivity goals this year, which I am very pleased with. In closing, the quarter turned out largely as expected with continued strength in Old Navy and Athleta, observable progress at Banana, and continued work necessary to stabilize Gap brand.","With that, Teri, I will turn it over to you.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks, Art, and good afternoon everyone. So I kind of look at our quarterly results through the lens of our balanced growth strategy, are we executing against the priorities we agreed, are we seeing the progress we expected? While we continue to have opportunities for improvement, we are pleased with the progress we are making, and confident in the appropriateness of our priorities.","Specifically as you heard from Art, our focus on growing and the value in active space is working, demonstrated by the continued strength in Old Navy and Athleta. Our investments in our digital business and customer experience will provide a unique and seamless shopping experience that will support continued differentiation and growth. And we saw some specific examples of that in the quarter. Underscoring these efforts is our heightened focus on improving the profitability of our specialty fleet as well as our productivity initiative. These efforts not only benefit our current results, but will truly optimize processes to create a more nimble and efficient organization going forward.","Obviously, we have to acknowledge the challenges at Gap brand, the business is not yet where it needs to be. Team remains focused on where they can have the most impact to optimize margin dollars and deliver continued improvement through the back-half. As we reflect on our historical performance, simple put, there have been too many instances where the businesses suffered because we failed to execute effectively. This is a key priority going forward, and we are using the current Gap experience to establish stronger operating discipline across all of our brands, often leveraging the best-in-class processes at Old Navy. We do remain confident in the balanced growth strategy and the focused actions that it drives. We are maintaining our outlook for the year against the backdrop of first-half results that were largely in line with our expectation.","So let me turn now to second quarter performance. And as a reminder, our reported results do include the impacts from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and these changed the classification of certain line items in our P&L. For the second quarter, these presentation changes resulted in an increase of $139 million to net sales, an increase of $95 million to gross margin, and a $94 million increase to operating expenses. To be helpful, we have included a slide again in our quarterly earnings presentation that details the Q2 2018 results with and without the significant presentation changes from adoption. This can be found on the investor section of gapinc.com. As always, Tina and Claire will be available also after the call to help with any modeling question.","So starting with sales; first, some housekeeping, throughout the year, we are aligning our comp sales reporting to adjust for the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. Accordingly comparable sales are compared to the 13-week period ended August 5, 2017. As Art said, we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp with a plus two for Q3 and a plus three on a two-year basis. Net sales for the quarter were $4.1 billion. When excluding the presentation changes from the adoption of new Rev Rec standards, this represents growth of about 4% over Q2 2017.","Also on this basis, spread for the quarter was largely driven by new store openings and translation benefits from foreign exchange. At the brand level, as Art said, Old Navy had another strong quarter delivering a positive five comp. This brings the two-year comp to 10%, and represents the third consecutive period of double-digit two-year comps. We continue to see broad-based trends in the business with growth across all divisions in nearly every category. The engine of the brand's sheer growth is the momentum in our loyalty categories: Denim, Kid Baby, Active.","At Gap, comp sales were down five against negative one last year. Obviously we are not pleased with this performance, but as Art said, it reflects the conscious choice to prioritize margin dollars over comp growth as we continue to move through the inventory issues and the brand. Importantly, we did see sequential progress from Q1 in key markets. Banana Republic posted its third consecutive quarter of positive comps with the plus two comp against last year's negative five. Notably, the brand delivered meaningful merchandize margin expansion in the quarter with the mid-single digit improvement in AUR. We continue to be very encouraged by Banana's performance. Their focus on improving the product and providing a compelling experience for customer is really resonating.","The Athleta fundamentals remain strong, while slim as a soft spot. The rest of the business continued its double-digit comp trends. And as Art mentioned, the growth trends in our online business remain very strong bolstered by the digital investments we are making. We are on track to reach over $3.5 billion in online and digital sales this year.","Moving to gross margin, on a reported basis, gross margin was 39.8%, $95 million or about 100 basis points expansion was driven by the presentation changes from Rev Rec. Excluding that impact, second quarter gross margin declined 10 basis points, driven by a merchandize margin decline of 70 basis points, partially offset by 60 basis points of rent and occupancy leverage. As anticipated, merch margin de-leverage was driven by Gap brand. While we continue to work through the inventory issues as previously identified, we did see the sequential merch margin progress at Gap brand during the quarter that we expected, and we continue to expect sequential progress over the back-half of the year.","In addition, we have seen some cost pressure from shipping expense in the first-half, partly due to start-up impacts as we turn on our new automation at our Fishkill Distribution Center. As we fully operationalize the new equipment and technology at Fishkill, we expect this pressure to moderate in the back-half. Rent and occupancy leverage was primarily driven by sales growth.","Regarding SG&A, on a reported basis, the second quarter total operating expenses were $1.2 billion. The presentation changes from Rev Rec resulted in a $94 million increase in operating expenses, and accounted for 130 basis points of operating expense de-leverage. When excluding Q2 2017 insurance proceeds and the presentation changes from the adoption of Rev Rec in Q2 2018, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about flat for the quarter.","As Art mentioned, driving SG&A leverage through expense control and reduction continues to be a significant focus for the company, and we have made good progress. If you look over the last several years, our SG&A has been de-leveraging approximately 170 basis points per year. Excluding the presentation changes from Rev Rec, our first-half SG&A leverage 10 basis points, and we continue to expect modest to no de-leverage for the year. This demonstrates the power of the work we are doing on productivity.","At the end of 2017, we established a dedicated internal team reporting directly to Art with the mission of identifying and driving against opportunities to reduce waste, drive efficiencies, and leverage scale. At the start of 2018, we set an internal goal to identify and action $200 million in productivity savings, marking a key step in our goal to deliver $500 million in savings. I am pleased to report we are on track to exceed that goal.","Savings to-date have been enabled by things like strategic sourcing negotiation with vendors to deliver lower non-product costs, and beginning to optimize the organizational structures at headquarters, Gap brand and Banana Republic, by reducing our non-working marketing dollars focusing on in-store waste and inefficiency, and of course tighter controls over discretionary spending. We are pleased with the initial progress we have made to realize what I refer to as the low-hanging fruit, or where we have opportunities to be just a bit more coordinated across functions, or frankly just smarter about where we spend.","Let me give you a couple of tangible examples that were covered through the work of our dedicated internal productivity team. In the areas of waste, we were throwing away significant amounts of excess in-store marketing content due to overproduction and misaligned store data. In process, we see opportunities to leverage system tools and automation in place as intended, versus some of our legacy processes that tend to be highly manual. And in scale, we have more opportunities to consolidate our product by the cross-markets and seasons to avoid minimum order penalties from vendors. As we move pass the low-hanging fruit, we continue to pursue opportunities to better leverage scale between brands, improve our product operating model, drive increased automation of work and processes, and eliminate non-value added work. These savings can fund our investments in the digital and customer areas that will further differentiate us and support growth.","Now, moving on to taxes and interest, our net interest expense was lower, driven primarily by increased investment income as we move to better optimize our yield on excess cash. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 23.5%. The lower rate for the quarter reflects the deferral of certain fiscal year 2017 income that benefits from the tax rate reduction of the TCGA. We continue to analyze our tax return positions under the Act and will finalize our fiscal year 2017 tax returns during fiscal year 2018. Resulting adjustments to our provisional amounts may continue to impact our second-half rates. At this time, we continue to expect a full-year effective tax rate of about 26%.","In earnings, second quarter earnings per share came in largely as expected at $0.76, compared to earnings per share of $0.68 last year. And that includes a $0.10 benefit from insurance proceeds. When excluding the benefit from a lower tax rate, we saw a $0.04 increase in earnings per share when compared to EPS last year, which is 7% growth. In line with expectations, FX was a benefit of about $0.02 for the quarter.","On cash flow, year-to-date, our free cash flow was $220 million, $15 million lower than the first-half of fiscal 2017, which included $59 million of insurance proceeds related to property and equipment. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Consistent with our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, we completed an additional $100 million of share repurchases during the quarter, and we ended the quarter with 385 million shares outstanding. Year-to-date dividends of $188 million currently yields prior year dividend yield of about 3%.","Inventory, we ended the quarter with inventory of 7% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Well, this is a point of time measure it's worth noting that about two points of the increase can be attributed to the calendar shift resulting from the 53rd week last year. Old Navy, which represents about half of our inventory, is entering Q3 with higher inventories in anticipation of plant store opening, but they are clean from a LIBOR perspective. Banana and Athleta also are largely in line with expectation, and we feel comfortable with the quality. We do continue to have some work to do on Gap brand given some of the assortment issues Art discussed. Inventory is up about 2% there, as we work to sell-through some of basics. Again, we made the conscious decision to hold this a bit longer given the warmer weather and the opportunity to enhance margin versus the quicker sell-off.","Regarding capital and store counts, year-to-date, capital expenses were $326 million. Year-to-date, we have opened 60 company-operated stores, largely Old Navy and Athleta, by closing 38 stores, primarily Gap and Banana Republic. We ended the quarter with 3,187 company-operated stores.","And now for the earnings outlook for the reminder of the year, as we have mentioned, at Gap brand, we are making the sequential progress we expected, albeit not as quickly as we might have liked. Neil and the team are very focused on implementing the operational discipline to return the brand to stronger profitability and growth. As we work through the remainder of the inventory issues, we are focused on solutions that maximize margin dollars. The fall season represents improvement as it is the first season, where we can narrow the assortment and begin to get inventory flows aligned. While not perfect, it should reflect improvement over the first-half with continued improvement through holiday.","We believe we have appropriate building blocks on the remainder of the year, and although Gap brand is coming in at the lower end of our planning expectations, we have been able to leverage our productivity efforts and the strength of our other brands to deliver the first-half largely in-line with expectations.","Additionally, as Art talked through, we have many customers digital and store initiatives that are building momentum and we expect that to accelerate in the back-half. Further, we have opened 37 new Athleta and Old Navy stores to year-to-date with plans to double that number in the back-half. As such, we are re-affirming our full-year earnings per share guidance range of $2.55 to $2.70 per share. As we mentioned in Q1, our ability to reach the high-end of the range will be more challenging given the trends we just discussed at Gap brand. And as a reminder, after adjusting for the presentation changes from Rev Rec, we expect spread to be flat to up slightly for the year. Keeping in mind, spread will be negative in the fourth quarter with the loss of the 53rd week.","We continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to be about flat for the year as our productivity efforts fund our digital and customer investments. To be bit more helpful regarding cadence, we do expect modest de-leverage in the third quarter, and meaningful leverage in the fourth quarter as we left some unique incremental spend in the fourth quarter of last year that we do not expect to anniversary. And one final reminder, our spread and SG&A guidance holds and looking at year-over-year compares on a like-for-like basis, with and without the presentation changes of Rev Rec.","So just to summarize, the quarter landed largely as we expected. We have more work to do, but we do remain confident in the appropriateness of our priorities as guided by the balanced growth strategy with continued focus on improving our executional excellence, leveraging our scaled operating platform, and exploring the power of our data assets.","So with that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. Starting out just regarding Gap brand, it sounds like some lingering problems, but the worst probably past. So bigger picture, as we think about the margin delta between Gap brand and the rest of the organization, what's the reasonable goal in terms of the pace of margin improvement over the next 12 to 18 months?","And then, separately, Teri just to clarify real quick, I apologize if I just missed this, but regarding the comp sales spread, can you clarify, was there a calendar shift benefit this quarter as you pulled over that back-to-school week? I mean if you could quantify that, that would be great. Thank you so much.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. So the second question first, so I don't forget that you have asked, there was no significant impact in the quarter from the shift. And part of that of course is because the back-to-school season is really lengthening out, it's less impactful in any given week as it may have once been.","Broader question on the Gap brand margin is obviously a very fair one, you heard us mentioned a number of times on the call that we are very focused on getting through these inventory units, getting back to normal on inventory as quickly as we can, but in the first quarter we actually sold through some inventory because we knew it was right to get through it. This quarter we made a more different conscious decision because of the composition of the inventory, and the weather to hold that inventory a little longer to be able to optimize margins. So every single thing the team does is with that margin progression goal in mind. And we do -- now, if we think about where we are this year, I honestly do believe we have the opportunity to make very significant advancements in our margin over the next 12 to 18 months. I mean that is goal to regain some of the lost profitability that we have experienced in such a short period of time.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks for the color, and best of luck.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks. Art, I guess beneath the surface on your core Gap performance, I guess maybe any color on how comps progress by month in the quarter, maybe any learnings from back-to-school, and I guess if you think a positive comp is possible by year-end at this concept?","Art Peck","Matt, I always admire your persistence. And I think those are all reasonable questions. We are not going to break it out, I think we have been pretty clear here saying that we expect to see sequential improvement here as to whether a positive comp is possible. Anything is possible, but I am not going to call it right now. As Teri said, we are focused first and foremost on getting through the units that we have in the business with maximum yield. I know that we took a boatload of styles in CCs out of the business as we got into Q3. And we continue to balance the assortment as we get into Q4. So we are looking for that sequential improvement. And we are hopeful that it comes back fast, but I am not going to -- I just can't sit here and try to call an exact number for you.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then, just a follow-up, Teri, on the SG&A front, I guess as we think about the investments to drive top line versus the productivity savings, is there a comp that we can think about as the best to leverage SG&A on a multi-year basis, just in terms of a fixed cost hurdle?","Teri List-Stoll","And looking at Tina, I don't think we have provided that metric, and it's sort of I don't have any color I can provide at the moment, Matt, sorry, but we are really -- I mean, as you can see, the reversal of the de-leverage that we have been experiencing historically is quite dramatic, and we do expect to be able to maintain that through the back-half of the year.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our question from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the Old Navy business and the $10 billion sales target now expanding into plus sizes, how do you see the classification opportunity in getting into that $10 billion? And the remodel store performance that you have seen in Old Navy how is that tracking and how do you see the progression of store remodels? Thank you.","Art Peck","Thanks, Dana, I appreciate it. If I think about the progression, and we have said this I think pretty consistently is the good news about continuing to drive growth in Old Navy is that it's very diversified, and we have confidence in that diversification. It's diversified across categories. So if you just look where we are seeing strength over the last quarter, knits and woven tops, big category, outerwear and sweaters, denim, woven bottoms, mens, knits and wovens, denim, woven bottoms, you see that strength in those categories and those are foundational loyalty categories, and it makes us feel really good about that strength.","We have added plus to it. We have been looking at plus. We think the plus base is the big opportunity. We have not built big number, to be honest, four plus into achieving that $10 billion goal. And then we are continuing to obviously build stores which have exceeded our expectations. And the remodel program, as I said, is driving a five point comps spread. So those are dollars that I can spend all day long to continue to remodel stores. We have a pretty aggressive plan. We have -- I think the number is something on the order of -- several 100 stores at least, that are what we call the Old Old Navy which are oftentimes where we do a light touch remodel, which is really not structural. What it is paint and lighting and where we do the cash wrap, so it super efficient from a cost per square foot standpoint. And those remodels are performing just as well as when we go and do a full gut structural remodel and put in our new P3 concept. So I think we have a tiger by the tail in the remodel program in terms of really driving tangible sales improvements, and most importantly, obviously giving the customer a respectful refreshed experience that they are really engaging on.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Art Peck","And then I would remiss not to say the online business, because I think we have said Old Navy has the lowest penetration of online. We are looking at, and feeling like how do we continue to accelerate our online growth rate? We feel really good about the work that we are doing, and there is a reason that we launched BOPS inside of Old Navy first, because we drive that business, and we drive big numbers. So we are really super excited about the integration of the digital into the physical, and the fact that really one plus one, is we believe is way more than two as those businesses come together and create converged experiences.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Randy Konik from Jefferies.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. I guess, Art, when you look at the traffic indicators that you presented in the PowerPoint, and Gap and Banana are lagging the industry average, how do you think about long-term positioning of these businesses? It seems like the market keeps thinking Gap Inc. is Gap yet the company is really Old Navy. So how do you think about kind of almost the position of how much real estate should be dedicated to those businesses? You have obviously worked on already communicating to us taking down store counts there, but what does it say about the long-term? And it's also really interesting that Old Navy has the lowest Internet penetration continues to be very strong, and shows no sign of slowing. So I was just curious how you are going to think about this all kind of melt together or you can separate the power of Old Navy and Athleta and kind of pull more of the exposure to Gap and Banana?","Art Peck","Yes. So let me just do a little bit of maybe correcting a misconception on the traffic. So if I look over the last four quarters, back to Q3 2017, to the most recent quarter, and I go by brand and by quarter, the only two quarters, where we did not beat industry traffic in two brands. So if you think about that as a metrics of 12 dots, there are only two that are red relative to the other. So we got a very good run, and I believe we can continue that run. And largely it is due to the many things that I have talked about, right, it's the bringing the digital and physical together, targeting our marketing, really put in place performance marketing capabilities, where we are targeting our marketing and increasing the effectiveness for acquisition, retention, and activation, pivoting the great majority of our dollars into digital channels versus traditional marketing.","And then the focus that we have in stores through our rewards program, loyalty program, and customer information, we are building and we have positive momentum in building our customer file. And that is paying off in our traffic. So I don't view the -- I think that maybe overall, the industry is going to see negative traffic. I don't view it as an inevitable in any way, shape or form that we have go in the direction that the industry is going, because we have ample evidence that we can consistently beat the industry traffic trends.","Now that said, the balance growth strategy is about managing a portfolio and allocating our resources and our investment both OpEx and CapEx to where we believe there is growth and continuing to reduce our exposure in places where we believe there isn't growth. And we have been doing that through obviously very aggressive store closures. And it's been most impactful in Gap in the specialty channel. We have not been impacting largely the outlet business in either Banana or Gap, because we believe those continue to be attractive businesses to be in. And then we are continuing to invest in online, because it is above average profitability as we have showed, and we believe there is long-term significant growth there. So I mean, Matt, I am glad you asked it, because the essence of the balanced growth strategy is to continue to focus our energies and invest in those businesses as well as reduce our exposure where we believe there is a downtrend at the end of the day.","Now, I will say, just as a sidebar that I believe Banana has growth that nobody really appreciates, because Banana plays as a specialty brand, as a specialty brand relative to the department stores and relative to the premium contemporary lines out there that are largely department store distributed. And what we see as taking market share or frankly losing market share as we did, it is largely against those competitors, and I think we have a good share opportunity right now, it's not like the entire department store sector is driving at the moment.","Randy Konik","Can I ask one follow-up then?","Art Peck.","You got it.","Randy Konik","Yes, sorry. If you then look at -- it's very helpful, one thing that really stands out is if we kind of go back to when the company disclosed the segment profitability by division, I guess we could have seen probably that the Old Navy margins have probably increased since then, but yet the Gap division margins have likely probably decreased. So really why Gap -- no pun intended of maybe 1,500 basis points, it's hard for me to tell between Gap and Old Navy at this point, I am just trying to figure out how you think about you positioning the business of Gap either from a real estate perspective or as you said, OpEx, what can be done to kind of just really get a little bit of that profit back and those margins back up?","Art Peck","Yes. I mean there is number of things, as you could imagine the equation, and let me point out that just the highest -- shareholder value is delivered tomorrow by beating expectations. And we believe we can, and we will see it, the sequential improvement in the business. If you go through the P&L, it's the things that you would expect, which is we do believe we owed some margin back in the business. And as we get the inventories in line and the assortment balance, we expect to see that. We are obviously taking out and we will continue to take out unproductive real estate, which has an impact on ROD. We do believe there is an opportunity in the overall cost structure of the business as well.","And then, importantly again, back to the idea of managing the portfolio is we are aggressively managing the channel shift and the mix of that business from specialty and continuing into outlet and online, and we have already told you that the outlet business -- I'm sorry; the online business is growing at a rate that is significantly greater than the rest of the industry. And so, it's a combination and there is more to it than that, but what I would tell you is I have been super pleased with Neil, as Neil is very thoughtful and very methodical about how he sees the waterfall and the P&L and where we have opportunity whether as to margin or cost in order to get some of that probability back.","Teri List-Stoll","And Randy, if I could just add, you are exactly right that since we disclosed margins last fall, there has been a shift, and we have been mixing into the healthier margins of Old Navy, Athleta. I wouldn't downplay the benefit of Banana on a rebound as well, which we do look at, and our objective as managers of the portfolio is to rewrite those contributions, so that Gap is going back to a more representative contributor to the portfolio earnings than it is today. But it is great to have the engines of growth we do have in Old Navy, Athleta, and the rebound in Banana at this particular time, and the productivity effort really just gives us some additional cushion to be able to continue to drive earnings progress in the face of this challenge, and knowing that we got upside from where we sit on the Gap brand given a lot more contribution today.","Art Peck","Just underlying the whole balanced growth strategy is about managing the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio to continue to pivot where there is profitability and attractive return on invested capital.","Randy Konik","Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Art Peck","Thanks, Randy.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the Gap inventory. You talked about the word, \"Imbalances\" on the product assortment. And so, I guess I was just curious what we would see in the stores, how you expect to work those out, and if you expect to see continued sequential merch margin improvement in 4Q even on top of the very difficult comparisons?","Art Peck","Yes. So let me just provide a little bit more granularity on the inventory, because it's little easy to get twisted up than I suspect. So, first of all, we have carried some inventory that we felt was seasonally quite saleable over, rather than liquidated at a sort of an artificial threshold. And we believe that we are not encumbered with liability, but we have saleable merchandise, and we can work our way through. So that's part of the issue.","If I look at the assortment imbalance, it's really not about the level of inventory largely, because we did bring levels down, it is about using our responsive capabilities, what we were able to cut in a relatively short period of time. And different products run different cycles, and as a consequence, the imbalance that we are referring to is really about having not the proper tops to bottoms ratio in the business that we feel we should have, we should be about 3 to 1, and we are lower than that.","So the short-term implication of that is maybe a little bit harder to complete an outfit, but it's not crippling by any stretch of the imagination, but it isn't ideal in terms of where we want to be. We have solid inventory in our bottoms business. We have solid inventory in our kids and baby business. But if you think about the architecture of the assortment is, tops to bottoms, your outerwear business, your wovens business, and how they all relate to each other, we are not quite in the place where we should be from the standpoint of the composition of the mix. And we are confident again that, that gets better as we get obviously through the back-half of the year and in the spring of next year. We did feel that to maximize margin, it was the right thing to do to really tighten up CCs and programs. And so, we took that action frankly knowing that we're going to be looking a little bit imbalanced, but still believing that was the right thing to do. And Teri, I don't know if you want to jump in on the part of that\u2026","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, I would just confirm, Lorraine, that we do expect to see sequential progress, and even against the Q4 compare, we would expect to be able to have positive compares there as well.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Chethan Mallela from Barclays.","Chethan Mallela","Good afternoon, I wanted to follow upon a comment in the prepared remarks about the benefit of online sales that involved your store because of the enhanced profitability. Is there a way to frame how much of the $3.5 billion of online sales this year you expect to involve your physical store? And how you are thinking about the relative growth rates of online only or digital and physical going forward? And if you could give on high level, just frame the magnitude of profit differential. That would be helpful as well. Thanks.","Art Peck","Yes. So let me try to way through this, and I will let you know if Teri kicks me out of the table here. So I think we've been reasonably forthright in saying on an ongoing basis that our online business we have traditionally and historically run, and pretty consistently run with a margin advantage above the line. And a lot of that has to do with the inventory dynamics of one pool of inventory, you don't have stranded inventory. You can price more dynamically and that kind of thing. And that above the line advantage on merch margin has more than compensated for the incremental fulfillment cost below the line. And so, if you think about it in what the advantages that we've showed before relative profitability without going -- because I don't think we have released the specifics on the margin differences and the channels, merch margin differences.","Tina Romani","This is Tina. We did with our presentation -- layout channel profitability and growth.","Art Peck","Yes. So it's probably best to refer back to that as to get an indication of the direction. And so, it's why we've always said, and we continue to believe that the volume that we continue to generate in our digital business can and will be accretive as it has been. On how much of that, so then you go through how much does a package cost below the line to fulfill, that's money that we don't have to spend and that will be, that's flow-through. The magnitude, it's just too soon to tell quite honestly. We've looked at analogs across other industry segments where they've turned on BOPS. And you can see penetration in ranges from 20% of your online business going that way to 50%. It depends on the category. I'm just not good, and it's even hazard to guess right now. We are very early days; we only turned on the marketing for BOPS, which you'll see if you engage on the Old Navy Web site. We only turned it on in the last couple of weeks. I would say all indicators are that this is something that she loves. But in no way, shape or form, have we really found out what the level of the lake is going to settle out at the end of the day.","The other thing that's exciting here is the opportunity to build a basket when she comes into the stores. And again, in early days, we are finding that 20% of our customers on average are buying incrementally when they come into the stores.","And so, if you think about the quality of that traffic, the opportunity to build the basket, the incremental profitability, it's something I think that has a long-term big potential for us, but it's again it's just very early days.","Chethan Mallela","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you so much. My question is on Gap brand, Art, and I wanted to just ask if you and Neil have any sort of initial diagnosis of what's wrong and what's the likely fix here at Gap brand? And just looking over the last decade, it looks like Gap division has had more years of negative comps and positive comps. So, is there something more endemic there that you think is making that path a little bit more choppy?","And then just a clarification, Teri, on the gross margin, I think you said that the 70 basis points of merchandise margin decline was driven by Gap, but then you talked earlier about trading comps for margin dollars with Gap brand. So I guess I'm not really sure how I can reconcile those comments that seem to be slightly contradictory, anything you could help us would be great. Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","And Kimberly, maybe I'll just close that out quickly. So I mean I think it implies what you're probably presuming, which is that the fact that we've worked to optimize margin doesn't mean we have made it positive, right, we continue to have pressure. Without those choices it could have been worse than it is.","Art Peck","And then on the deeper question, I don't think I'm slow and I don't think I'm stupid, and so I've been asking this question very much, because I'm pretty relentlessly objective and I want to love Gap brand, but I also want to be objective around whether there is something more wrong there than execution. And so, actually to that effect, I felt like it was super important to understand what the health of the brand was with this transition with Neil coming in. And we worked with an outside firm, bought apparel there with about 13,000 consumers, where we did a quantitative evaluation of the functional and the emotional equities of the brand. And we found that the emotional equities are actually quite strong that we have some issues on functional equities, where in one case, we might have customer perception of quality issue or fit consistency issue or that kind of thing. That actually was encouraging to me because I believe that functional equities are easier to address than the emotional equities of the brand.","And so again, I'm not saying this is easy at the end of the day, but I just want to communicate here that Teri and I, along with the Board quite honestly are relentlessly objective around this business, both what we need to do and what its role in the portfolio is as we look at the performance of the business relative to creating shareholder value. And so there's no dilutions, no emotional attachment. We do believe we have an opportunity to claw back some of the profits that were deserved here, but we're also objective about the business and about the potential of the business.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. Art, regarding Gap brand and the operating discipline, it is out there and I know you do some innovative technology in terms of test read and react to customer trends. How can those principles be applied to Gap? And as you think about a lot of the tools you have with data science and customer lifetime value, what do you see happening with those products in the back-half? Any areas you could highlight? Has that seems like a very powerful and differentiated competitive advantage just to understand existing versus new customer and lifetime value and analysis? Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes. I mean let me take the customer one first, and I'll be sort of little simple about because I can go way deep on this one. But again, I've highlighted our data assets, it's a data asset that we just -- we're really just scratching the surface, we're just starting to explore. Individual leads or data sciences team we're building that team up pretty aggressively. But really for the first time in the history of the company, we do have a 360 longitudinal view of the customer. And we know that customer's psychographics and demographics. We know how they do or don't crush off our brands. We know the -- and are learning the sort of gateway product purchases for our brands that result in continued engagement.","And the exciting part of that is more than interesting facts, it's -- and then we're able to target through digital channels pretty surgically look-alike customer segments that may not be engaged with the brand that show the characteristics of our best customers. And that is a very different approach to marketing, and I suspect most people in this industry have followed and certainly that's been our history at the end of the day. It is very aligned with what you would think about new economy company doing with respect to separating marketing out into performance marketing versus brand marketing. And that's very much how we're thinking about it going forward. So it is behind, the continued building of our file and the continued positive traffic that we're looking at.","And then, Oliver, I know you had asked the first question, why don't you repeat it again, because I'm not quite sure I understood it, and I want to make sure I'm getting my answer right.","Oliver Chen","The framework around the operating discipline opportunities at the Gap division and what principles at Old Navy are important going forward in terms of those being kind of the framework for thinking about recovery opportunity for improvement at Gap? And I imagine\u2026","Art Peck","Yes, and I'm\u2026","Oliver Chen","- aspects of test [indiscernible] are important.","Art Peck","Yes, and we are very much using that, and I think again, Mark and the work of the team at BR have been largely built on the Old Navy framework, and it's why I think we are seeing a nice balance, and why I have a lot of confidence in terms of what they can continue to deliver. First and foremost, we noted at the beginning of the year we had receipt timing issues. And we are on that. Again, we said that's going to get better quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, as unacceptable and it's not going to continue. That is really just operating discipline, and it had to do with a new tool that we have been introducing. We have largely worked our way through that.","Customer respond is super important. I just had my Board of Directors with Old Navy last week, and we showed them some of the test and response and capabilities we have and how much of the assortment is being tested. And there is a clear line of sight between testing and product performance, margin performance, sell-throughs and APS. And we are bringing those tools into back into Gap as quickly as we possibly can.","The other good thing I would say is that this is not we hired Neil and then we threw him in and come tell us when you are turning the business around. Neil is tightly integrated with the other three brand Presidents to make sure that we are leveraging the work that's working in the other brands as quickly as we possibly can, and we have transferred some on a short-term basis and some on a long-term basis talent into that business from other parts of the company. It's one of the most effective ways to cross-ref capabilities is to bring in some key players and to see them into the organization.","So I can go a lot more, and we don't have time for it right now, but there are clear principles here, and it's brought the business some problems at the moment, because we did not adhere to those, we let the assortment architectures slip, et cetera, but the path forward in terms of what we need to do and how we need to do it I think is very clear.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our conference.

My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Inc. Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Katrina O'Connell","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we're required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's press release as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 27, 2014, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Before we begin, I also want to mention that Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investor Relations section at gapinc.com. Joining us on the call today are Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. The February call is traditionally one that is pretty heavily skewed towards financial information, so Sabrina will be coming on in a minute to talk about Q4 '13 results, full year results and to give guidance for 2014. So with that as our backdrop, what I want to do is 2 things: I want to take you through what I believe were the accomplishments that Gap Inc. had in 2013 and then speak to our 4 global strategic priorities for this current fiscal year.","In 2013, we had a number of accomplishments that contributed to our performance of an increase of 18% in earnings per share, and some are more culturally based. The fact that we comped in every quarter, we felt good about. It was a very consistent year. The numbers had a little bit of variability into them, but we comped every single quarter. While the market numbers are not available just yet, we're pretty confident we can say we gained share again for the second year in a row. We gained share, especially in our domestic market of North America.","One of the things I feel good about when I think back on 2013 is, culturally, the business pivoted towards digital. This business is building a bridge between its physical stores and the digital world in which we operate. We know that's the winning strategy for us. I've been in retail 25 years. I grew up with the bricks and mortar side of the business. We have 3,600 stores, if you include our Franchise business.","It takes a company like ours a long time to make that mindset shift, but in 2013, we made it. We made it through some of the exciting investments we've made in the digital side of the business. We've made it through the new team we put into place, and that was something so important to the future of our business to get the right balance between our digital and physical messaging to consumers and offerings in those 2 channels. We launched Reserve in Store and \"find in store\" in 2013. Now in 2014, we have to market that strongly and make sure that all customers, especially millennials, are really aware of this service that we have that nobody else has.","We also demonstrated in 2013 that we continue to have a very flexible economic model. We saw that in the fourth quarter, where when the gross margin dollars in our business are not to the level we'd like them, we have the ability through multiple levers in the business to reduce cost and still achieve a very strong performance on operating margin and on earnings per share. I would actually say in 2013, we found new avenues of cost reduction. It was a combination between the flexibility in the model and constantly pushing ourselves to find new savings and new ways to get efficiency and productivity in our business.","Our International online business had another very strong year, and I mention this for a strategic reason. We continue to look at what the right balance is of our bricks-and-mortar business to our growing digital business internationally to have this growth. In Europe, in Japan, in China, there's always going to be a need for a customer to go into a store. Philosophically and strategically, Gap Inc. believes that. But finding the balance in our international markets is going to be important where the fleet is not as large as here domestically.","In the China market, we opened over 30 stores or more importantly, we opened at 4 new cities. We ended the year in 21 cities, which is good coverage for us. I'm sure everybody knows this stat but it's always worth repeating because it's so striking. There are 50 cities in China with more than 5 million people, so we're not even halfway there yet. What's important, because most people know we've been making a big investment in marketing and brand awareness long term, that's how you're going to win in China by having a real brand that people know what it stands for and what it represents. Our awareness in 2013 hit 70%, and that's equal to or above a lot of our international competitors who've been there many years before us.","2013 will be remembered as the year that Old Navy went international. While we tested a single store in Tokyo in 2012, we now have almost 20 stores in Japan. And that's opening the door because what happens now as we build the structure and we put the processes in place to have an International business, now you just got to layer on countries. And that's a big part of what Stefan put in place, but we are really prepared now in 2014 to take our biggest brand outside of its traditional 2 markets of the United States and Canada.","We opened up our 500th global outlet store in 2013. I actually finished at 525 plus, but we opened our 500th store. And this is a key tenet to the company strategy, multiple channels, strong in specialty, branded business, complemented by this derivative of our specialty business, which is our value outlet business and our online business, but that 500 stores globally really speaks to the opportunity for us and more international markets to come.","And finally, 2013, from the company's perspective as well as my own, was the breakout year for Athleta. It opened 30 stores. We have 65 stores now. But by every metric we look at, whether that's comp, traffic, penetration in key markets, what the brand stands for, the new customer acquisitions, it was really a breakout year for Athleta. That's something to celebrate in a business that has 6 brands, 3 that are iconic. It looks like Athleta is on its path to becoming the fourth iconic brand within Gap Inc.'s portfolio.","As we look at 2014 at Gap Inc., we're very focused on our 4 global strategic priorities. Let me talk about our global growth, and that starts with our International markets. And our International markets start with China. We'll have 30 new stores in the Chinese market, 4 new cities in 2014. That's made up of both specialty stores and outlet stores. We're looking at making some real investments beyond what we've done the last couple of years in our online business. We're lining ourselves up with some strategic partners. We do see the online market and mobile business, everything we're doing here domestically is we've seen it in spades in China, which lines up so nicely with how we see our business and winning both in digital and physical.","Old Navy opens up in China. The first store opens on March 1, which is next week. And we will do another 5 stores on top of -- that store opens in Shanghai next week in 2014. Then you have Old Navy International outside of China. We'll open about 25 stores in Japan, and we will go to our first franchise market this year in the Philippines. Our online business will deliver growth to us because day 1 when Old Navy China opens, we will open an Old Navy site on that exact same day on March 1. Same goes for Taiwan, the Gap Taiwan online will open up the first day our store opens. From a growth perspective, we'll open up 60 global outlets in 2014. And lastly, we will open somewhere around 30 Athleta stores and get just close to the 100-store mark by the end of the year.","Second big priority for us is on omni-channel, and it starts with -- from my perspective, it starts with marketing and driving awareness of Reserve in Store and \"find in store.\" As a matter of fact, Reserve in Store will be in all Gap stores. It was only in half the Gap stores at the end of Q4.","Domestically, one of the investments we're making -- we're making lots of investments. It's always about our site. How could our images look better? How could it be faster? Everything is important to us in online. But one area we're focusing on is on responsive design and making sure regardless of the device you're on, because not all devices are the same, how does the messaging and the images to get to the highest level of engagement possible based on how personalized each person's device is. That's a big investment we're making.","One new investment we're making as part of our omni-channel roadmap is to get into order in store, and we'll be doing some pilots in the first half of this year, whether that's on a self-service kiosk in our stores or a service component inside, which fits to the announcement we made last week about wages. More and more, our store associates, full-time, part-time, managers are being asked to do so much more. Lots of opportunity on the omni-channel. Some of the ideas in the U.S. will migrate to Canada. We're looking at click and collect in U.K., which is something that's more appropriate in that market than Reserve in Store is in North America.","And lastly, you'll see a lot more personalization in our business. We're going to operationalize it in this current fiscal year. That just starts with serving up homepages that matter to people based on their buying decisions historically or trying to make sure that if somebody is more interested in certain categories, certain messaging, that, that personalized homepage happens. This business is all about engagement. You're not getting put through, you're not maximizing engagement, and that's what personalization is about.","Third strategic priority is to build a responsive supply chain model. 2013, that started with a consolidation of our fabrics, eliminating lots of fabrics we didn't need. Now that we have a fabric library that's a lot less than it was the previous year, now you can platform those fabrics, and we're making huge progress on that. We went from almost having no fabrics platformed, and it's going to be a big difference in our business -- how much product by the end of the year came off a fabric that was platformed in the business. It's sitting at a vendor, ready to go. It introduces flexibility and speed to an operating model which we didn't have before, VMI or vendor-managed inventory.","We made big strides in '13. We're doing a lot more testing of products. Test and respond. You'll see a lot of that. That's happening right now in our business for fall. And in the back half, we're going to finally introduce rapid response. That's just having a model, which you can react in season. All of those will come together, and we're feeling pretty good about the progress we made.","And lastly, we are working to develop a seamless inventory model at Gap Inc. Responsive supply chain is a change in our supply chain model. This is the change in how we manage inventory, and one example is both in China and Athleta. In 2014, we will have inventories sitting on the same shelf that can be shipped to a direct customer to their home or to a store. To me, that's the holy grail of seamless inventory, and that's where we really can maximize our gross margin dollars.","So we'll be hearing a lot more updates about our vision of this for 2015. But I do want to inform everybody that we accomplished what we said we're going to accomplish last year. We have a global label now in all of our businesses. We have global assortment for each one of our brands, and we'll have a global fit by fall. And that's the foundational tenets of any seamless inventory model. We're getting those 3 components in place.","Before I hand the call over to Sabrina to take you through the numbers, the team here in San Francisco and New York and our offices around the world feel good about our performance in 2013. It was a good year on top of our performance in 2012. We are very focused at the beginning of this year on winning, on building this bridge between digital and physical, on executing these 4 global priorities flawlessly and retaining and attracting the best talent in the industry.","With all that said, Sabrina, over to you.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. Overall, we're pleased with our performance in 2013. We achieved our stated objectives, namely growing sales, delivering operating margin expansion, growing earnings per share and returning excess cash to shareholders. And we met our goals despite facing significant headwinds from foreign exchange and a shorter fiscal year.","Here are some for full year highlights. Net sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis, as we continued to gain momentum in growing globally through all of our channels, especially online, which grew 21% for the year. In line with our strategy, our revenue mix shifted to our higher-return channels, with online penetration growing 2 percentage points to 14%. Full year comp sales were positive 2%, driven by Gap at positive 3% and Old Navy at positive 2%. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 13.3%. Earnings per share grew 18% to $2.74 on top of last year's strong 49% growth. And finally, we distributed $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Moving to fourth quarter and full year financial results. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year results are negatively impacted by the loss of the 53rd week. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.6 billion, with comp sales up 1%. For the full year, reported sales were up 3% to $16.1 billion despite the negative translation impact from foreign exchange of about $240 million.","Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was down 280 basis points to 34.8%. Merchandise margins were down 220 basis points for the quarter, driven by the unusually promotional holiday season. And as we expected, rent and occupancy deleveraged 60 basis points, driven by the lack of the 53rd week.","For the full year, gross profit dollars grew by 2% to $6.3 billion, and gross margin was down 40 basis points to 39%. Our merchandise margins were down 50 basis points, and rent and occupancy leveraged by 10 basis points.","Regarding SG&A. Our discipline around expense management resulted in fourth quarter total operating expenses of $1.1 billion, a reduction of $103 million from the prior year, driven by savings in store expenses and overhead, as well as the positive impact to expenses from foreign exchange translation and the lack of the 53rd week. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses leveraged by 140 basis points.","For the full year, total operating expenses were $4.1 billion, down $85 million from last year, with the majority of the decline driven by translation of foreign currency. As a rate to sales, SG&A leveraged 130 basis points.","Marketing expenses for the full year were $637 million, down $16 million to last year. The result, we're pleased that we grew full year operating income by $207 million and net income by $145 million to nearly $1.3 billion.","Supporting our long-term growth strategies, we opened 190 new company-operated stores in 2013, with store growth focused primarily in Asia. In North America, store growth was driven by Athleta. Our square footage grew by 1%. Store count and square footage by division are listed in the press release.","Capital expenditures for the full year were $670 million. Though over half of our capital expenditures was on stores, importantly, we also continue to invest significantly in strategic areas like omni-channel and supply chain.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars per store were up 7% at the end of the fourth quarter, in line with our guidance. And we expect a similar increase in inventory dollars per store at the end of Q1.","For the full year, free cash flow was an inflow of over $1 billion, and we ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash. We distributed $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $134 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with 446 million shares outstanding.","And now, I'd like to share our outlook for 2014. This year, we'll continue to pursue a balanced approach to deliver on our goals. Specifically, we'll focus on growing sales with healthy merchandise margins, managing our expenses, delivering earnings per share growth and, as always, returning excess cash to shareholders. However, it's important to discuss the impact foreign exchange will have in 2014. Let's begin with the impact to our goal of growing sales with healthy merchandise margins.","Our objective overall is to deliver modest positive comps on a full year basis. In addition to our comp base, we plan to drive increased revenue through our multiple channels, newer brands and geographies. While comp is reported on a currency-neutral basis, our revenues and margins are subject to currency fluctuations. As a reminder, our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan, with combined sales in these 2 countries of over $2 billion. With a continuing depreciation of both those currencies, our reported results will be negatively impacted.","There are really 2 separate impacts of foreign exchange: the first is translation and the second is the economic impact to our merchandise margins. Because we hedge inventory purchases for our foreign subsidiaries 12 to 18 months in advance, we were largely shielded from the merchandise margin impact of the depreciating yen in 2013. However, as the old hedge rates lapse and new less favorable hedge rates come on, the cost of goods in local currencies will increase for our largest foreign subsidiaries. As a result, though we expect merchandise margins to remain healthy on a constant currency basis, on an actual basis, merchandise margin expansion will be challenging. Further, based on today's spot rates, translation will likely continue to impact us as well.","Having now explained this important dynamic to our merchandise margins and revenues, I would now like to turn to earnings per share growth. We expect reported earnings per share for fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of $2.90 to $2.95. Our guidance contemplates some of the foreign currency headwinds I just discussed. At today's spot rates, we estimate that the impact from foreign currencies reduces our reported EPS growth rate by 5 full percentage points. So to be clear, at its midpoint, our guidance of $2.90 to $2.95 represents EPS growth of 7% on a reported basis, which on a constant-currency basis would be 5 percentage points higher than that or a solid double-digit growth rate. Driven primarily by the foreign currency impact to our merchandise margin, we expect operating margins to remain flattish on a reported basis.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we remain very committed to our principle of returning excess cash to shareholders. Since the inception of our buyback program in 2004, we have repurchased about 630 million shares, representing over half of our shares outstanding at an average price of under $21. Over that same period, our free cash flow generation has averaged over $1.1 billion per year, and we very consistently distributed that free cash flow to shareholders, with distributions averaging over $1.5 billion per year over the same period. As a reminder, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization in November, and we have $966 million remaining on that authorization.","Finally, today we announced our intention to increase our dividend by 10% to $0.88 per share. This represents an increase to our annual dividend per share of more than 75% in just 2 years.","Here's some additional full year guidance metrics. Regarding company-operated stores, we plan to open about 185 and close about 70. We expect to increase net square footage in 2014 by about 2.5%, our largest increase since 2007. We expect capital expenditures to be about $750 million, reflecting continued investment in our strategic goals; and we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $520 million. And finally, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38.5%.","In conclusion, we're pleased that we continue to deliver strong financial performance while also making progress against our strategic objectives. As we enter 2014, we remain focused on a balanced approach to achieving our goals and driving further value for our shareholders. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","Thanks, Sabrina. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Oliver Chen with Citi.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the guidance going forward and the look forward to the healthy merchandise margin rate, what are the main drivers for you to achieve that in your view, given that we've come off of a mixed and challenging kind of holiday environment and you guys sailed through it with flying colors? And if you could spend a little just time talking about your assortment planning and your biggest opportunities there in terms of what you see in the marketplace and how you're executing by banner.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Okay, great. I'll start off, Oliver. I would say that our goal as the year progresses is certainly to bring our inventories even more in line with our total sales growth. So that's number one. Number two is, in the back half, we should begin to realize some benefits, albeit modest. But we definitely should begin to realize some benefits from our supply chain initiatives that we've been talking about for some time, like fabric platforming, as well as vendor-managed inventory. So that, together with what we believe will be solid assortments, is why we feel that delivering underlying healthy merchandise margins is certainly realistic for us. And I'll turn it over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","On the assortment planning, I'd say there's 2 -- I will not go in brand by brand. There's 2 changes, one that applies to Gap and Banana Republic, you'll see our assortment become much more global. So this is the balance that the business has to strike. If you're going to have a global label and a global fit, then what follows that is more global assortment. So the change there is that our local teams will be more involved in buying depth of differentiation as opposed to breadth of assortment. That's a pretty big change for us. And actually, from my perspective, it simplifies the business. It makes it faster. It provides more continuity across all of our stores of Gap in our 50-odd countries; and Banana Republic, in close to 30 countries. And the reason I don't mention Old Navy is that Old Navy just added Japan just about 18 months ago and Old Navy started off with a global assortment, global label and a global fit. And the second thing I'd add is that in order to really get the full value that a responsive supply chain, the assortment mix has to shift somewhat when we do our assortment mix, what's right for customers and how do we make sure it supports the brand and what the brand stands for and how do we gain share, but also the mix can change a little bit towards longer-living styles. So more styles that last 52 weeks. Now within that style, you can have a change in color. You can have a change in print. You can even have a small change in the style itself. But in general, using the fabric platforming, more longer-living styles, 52-week styles, more styles will last 24 weeks and then you'd have a few, percentage-wise, a little less on the 12 week or less. And these are nuances. We're not talking about 10 full percentage point changes but nuances that fit with the response in supply chain needs the company has.","Operator","Our next question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Paul Alexander - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Paul Alexander for Lorraine. Guys, can you just tell us a little bit about how you're thinking about the environment in 2014? As Oliver just said, we're coming off of a very promotional holiday and fall. But do you feel like things are getting better in that regard? And you do you think recent weakness in the mall is temporary like that or perhaps, something more secular? And how does that impact how you're planning inventory and promotions for 2014?","Glenn K. Murphy","I'd definitely say the mall traffic, for a number of years, if that -- has been slowing down. If that's the definition of secular, then we're definitely preparing for mall traffic to not robustly turn back upwards all of a sudden. So whether it continues to decline somewhat over time, I think that's realistic to assume. But that's part of our thinking of the omni-channel work we're doing. And the question for us we don't have just yet -- was early indications but they're not worth commenting on until we have more and more evidence. But we're -- as I said in my opening comments, this notion of getting people's eyeballs, which is greater than 50% of the engagement in our brands right now, start on a smartphone or an iPad or a desktop, how do you get that customer, getting them into the physical store and that's that bridge between digital and physical. And Reserve in Store is one of the tools to make that happen. Now we're only one player in the mall. So one set of brands or portfolio of brands with one tool called Reserve in Store is not necessarily strong enough to change the overall shift that's going on in frequency of visits or mall traffic. But for us personally, we're doing it because we have a category that people, at the end of the day, they want to buy it in the store. And absolutely, people buy our category and our brands online, but the vast majority of that number really hasn't changed in 5 years, would prefer to get engaged online and even bring their smartphone into the store so they can get into social media while shopping our store. But they want to buy the product, they want to have the shopping experience inside the store that involves fitting room service, looking at different choices so there's digital bridge of the digital environment in which we continue to invest in, and our physical stores is critical for us. The promotional environment, I think I kind of answered this the same time for the last 5 or 6 years, I mean, the environment has been promotional since 2008. There was promotions in 2007 but it picked up in 2008. Our way of dealing with that is we have a very strong outlet business. We have a very strong brand in Old Navy that are really are value brands. And we got to continue as a business to be innovative and creative and bring reasons for people to engage in our brands, either online or in our stores, that are not rooted in promotions and discounts with the frequency in which they're rooted in today. And sometimes we do that very well but, in general, I think that's a huge opportunity for us and one that our brand presidents are very focused on in 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering, Sabrina, you mentioned that you found some, let's say, an unlock and additional SG&A savings opportunities in the back half of the year. Can you just help us understand where those came from? And I'm not expecting the same challenges necessarily to persist in the second half of the year here in 2014. But if they did, do you have incremental opportunities beyond the SG&A savings you secured last year?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, sure. Kimberly, for the most part, I think you've seen us pretty consistently show a lot of discipline and flexibility around our expense structure. And that's because over 50% of our expenses are store-related, and then over 50% of that is variable. So we know how to sort of flex our expense structure quite nimbly, I'm proud to say. With regard to the end of this year, I mean, for the back half, in total, of course, we benefited from the lack of the 53rd week. So expenses would naturally, some portion of them will just be down. We also benefited from the translation of expenses from foreign currencies coming in less. But we did, in fact, for sure, have old-fashioned discipline around store expenses were a big lever in that. Because again, they're largely variable. And then secondly, our overheads, in total, we also experienced quite a bit of good discipline around that. Looking forward into 2014, it is always our goal to remain disciplined and try and leverage expenses. If we achieve our goal, of course, of increasing revenues and delivering modest positive comps, we would expect our expenses to increase on a nominal basis but always leveraged. And we'll use many levers within that large expense area in order to deliver that. What I will say is it's likely -- given that we just delivered 130 basis points of leverage in 2013, it's likely that our 2014 leverage won't be quite as large. We guided to reported operating margins being about flattish, and so that's why you probably wouldn't expect quite as much leverage. And but yet, we will still be very, very focused on it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Adrienne Tennant with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Glenn, I was wondering if you can give us some more color on the analysis that went behind the decision to raise minimum wage to $9 this year and then $10 in the out-year. And is that, in effect, right as of -- as we speak? Or is that going to be in effect? And if so, at what point in time? And along with that, are -- is there additional training or responsibilities that accompany those higher wages?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, the analysis was -- it was fairly extensive. It was more -- what we said in our releases on Wednesday was a strategic decision that we were looking at for a period of time, and that was a little bit grounded in the launch of Reserve in Store back in November of last year. And staring at our roadmap, and I just mentioned on the call that we're looking at order in store, we're looking at other initiatives that are going to support the omni-channel roadmap for the company. So as we look at all those initiatives, start off with \"ship from store,\" \"find in store\" is really dependent on store associates explaining that to customers, selling that, comments [ph] that benefit that Reserve in Store is step-up above that. Order in store is another step. So the management team, we sat back, talked to the brand presidents, and we just came to realize that, in spite of what other people may be thinking about stores and their future, we're actually looking at the role of store is going to incrementally increase as more and more of these initiatives and these ideas and these convenient services get provided to customers. In terms of the economics, we have always changed our rate of pay in June of every year. So the $9 for 2014 is going to start in June of 2014, and the $10 will be effective in June of 2015.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could parse out the strength of the online business. Were there particular areas of strength there by geography or concept? And then just out of curiosity, when you report the online sales, does that include the omni-channel purchases?","Glenn K. Murphy","I'll answer the -- well, I know the answer to both, but yes to the second one. But the first part, I mentioned in the opening comments, we've been very pleased with our International growth when it comes to online. And now that we're into multiple years, it's really -- it's not only the growth but it's the penetration to our total store sales. And so good -- very good numbers in the U.K. Although we have the service in France and Italy, as well for our other European stores. But very strong in the U.K., continue to be strong in Canada -- it's been strong in Canada for 3.5 years now since we've launched it. We're in Japan just about a year now, which is a \"ship from store\" model, which we're going to move to ship from distribution center but penetration is really beyond what we thought it was going to be. And we've opened in China, day 1 in November of 2010, with our stores. We did a test. Now which I'd like to see us roll out, but I'll be talking to our Head of Franchise for Gap this weekend. But we did a test in our Turkey franchise market, where, again, that was a ship from their distribution center. It's a turnkey online that we brought to them, and we feel very good about the results so far. So -- I'm sure all of our franchisees, knowing that the corporate market strategy for us is this multi-channel, multi-brand approach. And I've talked to a lot of our franchisees and they're also interested in the specialty stores, which they all have now moving quickly. If this Turkey test continues to go where it's going right now, moving that to the other franchise markets and looking at outlet stores. So International market is very strong and no real need to report anything by brand. I think we've been pleased with all business performance by brand, except for maybe a little bit stronger than we thought it was going to be in 2013 with Athleta. And the reason behind that is when you take a fleet from 35 to 65, even though our strategy is to not have a level of cannibalization in our online business, we've been pleased about how strong their online business continues to be with Athleta as we add the physical presence to that brand.","Sabrina L. Simmons","And just to underscore what Glenn said, the revenue is booked where the transaction takes place. So our \"ship from store\" sales, because they're made online, they're all booked as part of the online sales. And those have been robust, especially as we brought more of our fleet on to \"ship from store\" and has certainly helped our growth rate online this year as well.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. And then just quickly, Glenn, to your points about the opportunity to improve the promotional dependence, do you see opportunity on the AUR front this year? Or to your point of about the healthy merch margin, is that much more sourcing, I guess, Sabrina?","Glenn K. Murphy","I think we look at it this way. We look at -- there's a number of initiatives that I talked about in the opening call. One of the ones worth highlighting was responsive supply chain. And the purpose behind that is customer first. So when we talk about AURs, it's really about top line growth. And that could be driven by AUR. But what we're really looking for is through a responsive supply chain, and I covered it off at the beginning and Sabrina added some color behind in her comments. I think that is a path to get better top line growth, which is then better market share growth. And we believe that one of the metrics that will drive that top line in the back half when responsive supply chain starts to kick in should be some improvement in AUR. And that's what our brand presidents are accountable for and that's what they're executing towards for the back half of '14.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Glenn, I was wondering if you could focus a little bit more on your earlier comments on personalization. It seems like that has been an idea that's been talked about in the industry for several years now but always seemed longer term in nature. I was just wondering if now with -- 2014 might be the year that we start to see meaningful impact on your business from personalization. And how should we think about the growth in the development of that capability relative to other omni-channel capabilities that you have, such as \"ship from store,\" Reserve in Store, which you rolled out pretty quickly?","Glenn K. Murphy","Let's say, Matt, that it's on the roadmap that we have. 2012 was really the beginning of \"ship from store.\" And I said, we're now looking at, in Q2, to start to put into our stores the capability of order from store and that could be -- that can be a do it on your own. That could be a self-order from store, whether that's through some kind of kiosk we're going to put in. But we've been testing a lot of different tools or whether that's actually with the aid of the service. That's the reason why the wage strategy is so important. Personalization, we've really only been working on for the last 3 months, and there isn't a day that goes by that we're not testing a personalization idea on the web. Now it's -- we've been big fans for a long, long time, getting away from this macro approach to consumer communication and getting into person casting, and we have the data and we've been fortunate, given our geographical location, to really put investments that are -- were in our P&L in 2012, were in our P&L in 2013 to build the big data environment we need in order for personalization to begin on the web, first and foremost, that's serving up web pages with the goal of getting a higher click-through. And that could be by category. That could be by certain promotions. Customers, historically, have reacted better than other customers. And I think it's the -- not to use the bridge analogy again -- I think it's a stepping stone to loyalty. And that's what everybody wants. Again, it's our definition of loyalty. This is not -- loyalty is sometimes seen in different sectors where for you, you pay $0.99, you have a card, you pay $0.79. I think that's a historical loyalty program. But it's really looking at how personalization could then help unlock how we truly get to a loyalty play by customers and to this goal of person casting. Testing's been going well. We've been impressed with numbers. I mean, it's -- when you think about it, how many eyeballs we see per week on our homepages and we're serving up, excluding the test we do on a daily basis, it's the same homepage to completely different people. So different -- I mean, we have to look at it differently for new customers versus lapsed customers versus existing customers versus people with high frequency, low frequency. We have all that information. So we've an amazing team downstairs. I've been very impressed with the results I see every month on the testing they've been doing. I'm not looking for much in the first half, but I think as the testing continues to grow, we can figure out exactly what the driver is click-through, which gets the conversion, which gets to higher sales, which, therefore, leads to market share. I think in the second half, it's something we're not talking about right now, maybe a little bit more at our Analyst Meeting, hearing it from Art Peck and members of his team. And I think that there's something there in the back half that can provide some real value to the company.","Operator","And our next question will come from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Glenn, as you think about all the ways that you're growing the business these days, what are your current hurdle rates that you set for the company from a returns perspective? And then I'm just wondering, can you rank which projects you believe will be generating the highest returns? Will they be Gap China, Old Navy Japan or China, Athleta in the U.S.? Just wondering how you're thinking about where the real high-return projects are.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. I'll start, Paul, with that. So Glenn and I, obviously, work very closely and spend a lot of time on capital allocation. Our starting point is to sort of look at our long-term, weighted-average cost of capital, and our hurdle rates are going to be several points above our weighted-average cost of capital. Because projects we approve, we want to make sure, even if they have some variability to their pro formas, that they're going to deliver for us. So we have pretty high bars with regard to returns. And then with regard to our priorities, that's precisely how we set them is we look at the ranking of the various business cases and geographies that come to us. But importantly, we take a long-term view. Or certainly, you would never have launched something like China, which is going to provide us with an enormous runway in the long term, especially in terms of revenue. It already is contributing significantly to revenue but takes a longer time to return because of the uniqueness of the market and the infrastructure needs. So there is a lot of discipline internally around looking at returns and prioritizing our initiatives around them.","Glenn K. Murphy","And I'd say, in some kind of order, and I think this is being repetitive, Paul, from maybe a few calls ago, our Franchise business has the highest return and will continue. And that's why you see Old Navy are going to do 5 to 6 stores in the Philippines in 2014, and that's the beginning of the Old Navy franchise rollout. It takes almost no capital from us, a very small amount. But the returns have been phenomenal, and that -- it's a -- we always try to -- to build on what Sabrina said, we'll try to look at capital holistically, and we try to look at every year as a pool of capital like this year and what are the right decisions for the company strategically, but then how do we make those calls to get a good blended capital? Franchise, global outlet and factory stores, global online. That's why my opening comments, talking about these very strong growth rates in the U.K., in Canada, in Japan, in China with, not a lot of investment, but yes an investment that's returning multiple times over. Then I'd say from a brand perspective, yet to be proven, but if you're just asking me sitting here today, what do I think we're going to feel really good about in the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years to come it's going to be Old Navy International. I think that, that business -- if we go into the right countries as we have in Japan, as we will in China and then the Franchise business, the real estate opportunity in those countries we can get really a percentage rent that's super attractive and get sales per foot better than we get in North America and get an economic model that I really think we can have where the percent of business on promo and the depth of discount is not as large. I think that business has the potential, assuming we execute and that Stefan and his International team stay on that business, and its true potential, I think that really has great return for us. Two other projects I mentioned upfront that are not growth-based, omni-channel, which have a very good return on capital for us; and seamless inventory, when it gets going in the latter part of 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Morris with BMO Capital Markets.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Glenn, can you give us a quick holiday postmortem x weather and mall traffic, what could you have done better so we can set our sights on opportunities for next year? And then also, just a quick follow-up on Athleta, the growth there really meaningful now, approaching 100 stores by the end of the year. So beyond your previous remarks, share with us the performance there. Is it balanced regionally? What are the strengths and challenges?","Glenn K. Murphy","Yes. John, the holiday question, that -- we could be on here for a long time. I mean, there isn't a holiday or actually any month that goes by where I don't think the company's trying to learn what could we have done better. We came out of Thanksgiving and realized that December was not likely going to play out as we'd planned many, many months ahead of time. So it became a little bit more with some traditional ways of communicating and engaging customers and trying to get them either in stores, online and get the conversion in our business to produce the one comp we had. Look, I think holiday has changed, and we need to look at it differently. So we've had -- to say we've had multiple meetings would be an understatement since the 1st of January for all of our businesses. This is the benefit of having a portfolio, is how does Old Navy approach it? How does online, Banana Republic and Gap, in particular, how do they approach the holiday business for the benefit of Gap Inc.? So there's some lessons where it starts earlier. There's been -- there's lots of ways in which we looked at it and said if we could do it again, what we'd do differently? It all starts with product. And I think that I would just say from my perspective, just to give you one lesson, it wasn't at the top of my list but it's probably one I can say on the phone, is that as you move into December and more and more people are looking at gifting as opposed to self-purchasing, that our industry and us, in particular, really don't offer as much gifting choice as we should. And I think that's a design issue. That's a merchant issue. That's a marketing issue. But that was a clear lesson that the whole business looked at as we are all in stores, all looking at our online, whether it's on an iPad every night and putting ourselves in the shoes of customers coming in on December 12. But again, whether you're -- when you're on your smartphone or in our store, what are you looking for? Did we offer that? Did we sell it? Did we market it? And personally, I was disappointed. We had a one comp, and I'm sure that gain share relative to everybody else. We should have done a lot better, and that's one of a number of lessons. We're very happy with Athleta. It's not often we single it out, and maybe it's a little optimistic of us or me, in this case, to call it the fourth iconic brand within our portfolio sooner rather than later. But I've been -- I was very impressed with our performance in 2013. We have some new leadership, and they made some very good decisions. I think the trends in the marketplace when it comes to women and when it comes to performance and fashion and how they're dressing in general and the products in which we offer and the changes in which we are making, they just seem to fit hand in glove. And this is a brand that's resonating for a lot of different reasons. But as you suggest, getting to 100 stores, it starts becoming a more serious business for us. And we haven't had conversions yet about International. This is just -- we have a 100-store plan coming out. It's very strong online. It's gaining in terms of consumer awareness and acceptability, and I think in the profile of the age of our customers has changed in 2013. So very good team, very focused, it's a great brand and the business is, we're -- couldn't be any happier with the acquisition and looking forward to 2014.","Operator","And our next question will come from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You guys talked about, I think, 2.5% square footage growth. I think that you've mentioned the highest rates since '07. I know a lot is coming internationally. What's really giving you the confidence overseas? Is there an inflection in the brand awareness? I know you threw some numbers out on China? Are you going to require greater levels of marketing just to enhance the brand awareness in some of these new markets? It seems like a pretty big inflection.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I would look at it a number of different ways. If you just look at international markets, we'll open at least between 70 and 80 franchise stores in 2014. So that's a little bit of Old Navy coming in but filling into just in countries -- introducing new countries. We understand the franchise market really well and that's leading with Gap, following Banana Republic. And Gap has very strong awareness around the world, and we only put disproportionate amount of capital when the awareness is below a certain threshold we find acceptable. Then I -- if you start in some kind of order, our global outlet business continues to be really strong, a little bit domestically but really filling in, in international markets. It's the only investments we're really making in Europe right now. We're happy with our specialty fleet. We've closed what we needed to close in the U.K. We had the right store fleet in France. We're just on hold in Italy, waiting to make sure we get clarity on the economy and the marketplace. But we continue to fill in with a global outlet. So there, in Japan and China, I think that's sort of the first area where we're putting money. And then here comes China for Gap specialty. And look, what we -- Sabrina said earlier, we have treated China in a different way than we treated any other country, and we continue to make investments in marketing that are appropriate because the long-term benefit to anybody going to China is to really establish a strong brand and a bond with the Chinese consumer. And communication and standing for something, that's important everywhere in the world. But it's particularly important to newer brands. We've only been there 3 years in a country like China. So there's some capital going there and then Old Navy International. And Athleta, I just finished answering John's question about the extra 30 to 35 stores for Athleta in the U.S. So that is an easy decision, Athleta. And Asia is a, for us, at least with our brands and the introduction of Old Navy, also are easy decisions. Now some people we compete against opened 400, 450 stores in countries and that's their decision. We are much more thoughtful, we have a different approach. There's 190 corporate stores plus the 70 to 80 franchise stores, call it 260 to 270 total stores, that's a very good year. It's almost a store a day. So we're really happy with that amount of presence and investment. But don't forget, this a business that has a 2-dimensional strategy and the other part of that is online. So while the store fleet investment, that I just described, makes sense, we're also not going to end up having the number of stores in any of those markets into the -- on a per-capita basis like we have in the U.S. The online day 1 opening it up, and it's a different customer in 2014 in China than it was in 1994 in the U.S. That two-prong approach is so important to us and it allows us to do the number of stores I described, and we don't have the need to do 400 or 450 stores because we can get the volume and the return and be current with our digital strategy.","Sabrina L. Simmons","And then briefly on the marketing side, we haven't said anything explicitly about '14. But I think 2013 is good evidence that we were growing internationally while we held our marketing dollars. We actually brought them down slightly from 2012. So I think that we're holding to the discipline that our marketing levels are very healthy, and we can look to reallocate and reinvest in those areas that are going to support our future growth the most.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, Glenn, we haven't really talked about merchandising at all, and you guys are still an apparel retailer. So just wondering, as you have a cohesive team now, maybe for Gap and Old Navy, can you talk about which categories you see as opportunity to drive the business in 2014? Are there any big businesses out there you're excited about, to rebuild productivity at both Gap and Old Navy? And for Sabrina, 2013, I guess, you ended the real estate cleanup process. So wondering, what kind of store comp you need domestically to get ROD leverage going forward?","Glenn K. Murphy","Thanks, Brian. We -- look, we'll answer any questions if somebody wants to ask about product or merchandising, I mean, we're only as good as the questions we're asked. So from a category perspective on Gap, not a big change. But I would say that the team is focused on a couple of areas. One, we've seen a change and a shift in our Baby business and -- not at the expense of Kids but more powerful Baby business than Kids. And I think you're seeing that team that we have in New York under Rebekka's leadership, putting some investments whether that's in new categories or that's just in the inventory going out. I think the Baby business is going to play a much more prominent role in Gap brand going forward. So that's a merchandising change for sure. And the other one, and this has nothing to do with Athleta, I'm sure the Gap team would have landed there themselves, but as the -- as more and more trends start to push women, in particular, towards street attire, we start looking at the balance between the athletic part of our business and the going-out part of the business and sort of the -- as a lot of people have been talking about, this is the new denim. Well, Gap is very well situated with its Gap Fit product as the foundational product to build into this new trend that's going on in the marketplace. So if you go to any of our stores, you'll see that business being pulled out of Gap Body's traditional space in the store and brought more and more closer to the front of the store. And I think that trend that's going on that fits with Gap and its American casual style and how women are dressing, especially millennials, I think you'll see some merchandising changes in that part of the business when it comes to Gap. At Old Navy, it's tough to sort of choose one over the other. I'd say that they've been a little less pleased with their men's business the last little bit and realizing that they're making some changes in that area, not only in merchandise, and I'd say in marketing, in-store visuals. That's something that our customers should be looking for very clearly, and the other part in that business is they do so well in denim. And the Rockstar was a big launch for them a couple of years ago and really elevated their overall positioning on denim. You'll see something next week, and that's just the start, but you'll see Old Navy getting in and trying to establish their pants business for women's, which is -- we're in the bottoms business as a total company. That's true of all brands: Banana Republic, Gap and Old Navy. But from a merchandising perspective, I think the second complementary investment of marketing and product and inventory and location store and space on the website for pants, casual pants, is going to be a really big play for Old Navy in 2014. There's a bunch of other puts and takes, and I can say the same thing with Banana Republic but all of them come in to every season and every year based on strategically where they want to gain share, where they see an opportunity, does that fit with the position of the brand, and those are just a couple of examples for Gap and Old Navy.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. And then with regard to rent and occupancy, it's a great question, Brian. To leverage rent and occupancy, we definitely need positive comps. And I think for one of the reasons you mentioned, the leverage in our future will probably be more modest than it was in the past. And there's really 2 reasons. One is what you mentioned, that we have a lot of the cleanup of the North America optimization behind us. And that, in past years, really while we were closing a lot of unproductive square footage helped us leverage quite a bit a broad per point of positive comps. Secondly, while we remain focused on leveraging ROD within every country, as we enter some of these International markets, the rent per square foot generally is higher than it is in North America. So when you look at the mix growing that way, all in, it's a little bit of a headwind to leveraging ROD. So we still feel good about leveraging on a positive comp, but the amount of leverage for each positive comp point will likely be more modest in the future.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on, Sabrina, the discussion about underlying x some of the currency issues, some healthy merch margin behavior, can you talk about how much of that is AUC based on some of the fabric platforming and other initiatives versus less markdown focus and where you think that's really come from? And maybe just give us an explicit AUC outlook for the full year.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, it's a good question. I think that the broad answer, Lindsay, is we're looking to get improvement in both areas, AUC and AUR, as the year progresses. So we're not giving any explicit guidance on AUC. It hasn't been a headline either way in 2013, nor do we expect it to be any dramatic swings that would have it be featuring as a headline in 2014. But as I said, as the year progresses and we start to see benefits from tools like fabric platforming, that -- as we consolidate fabrics and continue to negotiate with our vendors, that certainly, it's rational to believe that, that should bring us some costing benefit more in the back half as we implement that to a higher degree than in the front half. And then -- and I think as Glenn explained in an earlier Q&A, because of these supply chain tools, we should actually be able to do better in terms of assorting what we put into the stores and get a higher probability, whether it comes from a true reg [ph] or less of a markdown margin, any of the combination of those will take. But certainly, we believe the tools in place are increasing our probability of getting better yields on the product we assort to.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just to follow up on the seamless inventory comment, Glenn, I think you talked about seamless inventory being in place for fiscal '15, but I know you have \"ship from store\" capability in the U.S. and have already -- or North America and have already started to prosecute that. Where are you in how nimble you are with your inventories in-store and the ability to service adeptly online demand versus in-store demand? How much more of an unlock is there from an inventory turn and efficiency perspective?","Glenn K. Murphy","Lindsay, I'd say that we're \"ship from store\" enabled in every store. And the issue is that -- is how many orders do they -- does each store receive on \"ship from store.\" So we've gone from thinking of it and -- let me just step up for a second. You're right, the \"ship from store\" was the precursor that opened up the thinking in the strategic decision to go with seamless inventory. Now back to where we in \"ship from store.\" Start off as satisfying customer unmet demand online that we thought was at a higher service level but it turned out to be based on the fact we operated only 2 DCs for our online business versus the stores that serve our customers in our stores. That's how it started. And then we got benefit from achieving a higher service level for online customers by exposing all of our store inventory to that unmet demand online. And then it's graduated now to what is the yield management benefit of \"ship from store.\" So right now, when there's demand that comes online, could that be directed -- even if the inventory is available in the distribution center, could that be directed to less productive markets or less productive stores where we have a history or we currently know that, that ultimate AUR is going to be below -- significantly below where we're currently the consumer is demanding and willing to pay on an online order? So the sophistication has changed, and that's a little bit in place in Q1, but more will be rolled out. And it's just our view of going -- let's just expose our inventory in a seamless way, and let it go to the highest AUR we can get. And if that's online and it's in the store net of a shipping cost is that better gross margin for the business. And the reason that this is that markets can perform differently as some people are experiencing in December and January. That can happen. It can also happen that stores, because of their physical size, have an assortment that is a little different for that store, it's not -- even though our stores have been rightsized, they're still not all perfect. And there's a history where that store has a lower gross margin than another store. So that's just turned that demand to where the biggest opportunity is and pull that inventory out. And the second thing we're doing is on seasonal changes, like when you go from outerwear in December to an assortment change in January, the liquidation of inventory in January in certain stores can be very expensive. All of -- people in our business have units below cost. But the demand online is a lot less seasonal. It's amazing how much outerwear we sell online in January, December and March -- sorry, January, February, March, relative to what we sell in the store. So keeping that item alive online at a very attractive price and then using that demand, let's say, in the third week in January, but directed to a store before that inventory goes to a price below cost, which can happen in the apparel business, then you can, as they say, you can pull an arbitrage on the gross margin and sell it for a much higher AUR online. So it's this constant evolution of how we're thinking about \"ship from store.\" And the reason that seamless inventory is such a big priority for us, it is about opening up our perspective of inventory and let it go to the highest gross margin dollar per unit in a country, in a distribution center geographically and in the store. And then when you open that all up, the opportunity for us in 2015, \"ship from store\" is one small component of the eventual strategy on seamless inventory.","Katrina O'Connell","Great.

Joining us on the call today are CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sabrina.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with some highlights for the year and then I will go through Q4 results before turning to the outlook for 2015.","For the full year, EPS grew about 10% excluding the estimated year over year impact from foreign exchange. On a reported basis, our earnings per share for the full year grew 5%. Our largest brand, Old Navy, delivered positive comps in each quarter and finished the year with a strong 11% comp in Q4. We achieved our goal of leveraging expenses. At 25.6% of sales, our SG&A rate was the lowest since 2005. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion and distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders through share purchases and dividends.","Moving to the fourth quarter and full year financial results, regarding earnings, there\u2019s been quite a bit of focus on the recent strengthening of the US dollar and its impact to 2015 earnings, which I\u2019ll address of course in the outlook. But it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ve already absorbed a great deal of foreign exchange headwind 2014.","Full-year net earnings were $1.26 billion and earnings per share were $2.87. This includes about $0.14 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The FX impact was most pronounced in the fourth quarter. Excluding the estimated year over year impact from foreign exchange, Q4 earnings per share grew about 20% versus last year. On a reported basis, net income was $319 million and earnings per share increased 10% to $0.75 per share.","Turning to sales, sales for the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion and increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales were up 2%. For the full year, net sales were up 2% to $16.4 billion and up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by Old Navy\u2019s strength. Comparable sales were flat for the year.","Moving to gross margins, fourth quarter gross profit increased by $65 million to $1.7 billion and gross margin expanded by 40 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were up 60 basis points for the quarter and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $6.3 billion, and gross margin was down 70 basis points to 38.3%. ","At the beginning of 2014, we stated that foreign exchange would likely pressure our merchandise margins. For the year, merchandise margins were down 40 basis points, driven by the FX impact as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand. As anticipated, rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points.","Regarding SG&A, for the fourth quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion with marketing expenses at $178 million, slightly below last year. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion and leveraged 10 basis points despite moving $160 million of credit card income out of SG&A and into merchandise margin. Marketing expenses for the year were $639 million, about flat to last year.","Regarding stores and capital expenditures, we opened 116 new company-operated stores in 2014 net of closures. In line with our strategy, international store growth was focused primarily in Asia and North America store growth was focused on our outlet channel and Athleta. Not surprisingly, closures were focused on Gap specialty North America. Our square footage grew by 2.4% in line with our guidance. Store counts and square footage by division are in our press release.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, as we stated would be the case, we improved inventory levels throughout the year. Inventory dollars per store were down 5.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. This was better than our previous guidance, driven by foreign exchange, favorability and stronger than expected sell through at Old Navy.","We ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash after having distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders. Ending share count was 421 million shares.","And now I\u2019d like to share our outlook for 2015. Regarding earnings per share, on a reported basis, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 and $2.80. Included in this guidance is an estimated unfavorable impact from foreign exchange at current spot rates of about $0.16. And unfavorable impact of about $0.13 due to the West Coast port situation and an expectation for slower turnaround at Gap brand. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the port issues and last year\u2019s gain on sale, our underlying expected EPS growth rate for 2015 would be about 12 percentage points higher or about 9% EPS growth at its midpoint.","Now let me address the port issue. While we\u2019ve been managing the slowdown at the port for some time, it\u2019s the additional weekend closures in February and the resulting additional backlog that are driving the expected negative impact to earnings.","In simple terms, the first quarter is impacted by having fewer units available for sale. It\u2019s important to note that this is particularly impactful to Old Navy, given the importance of the Easter holiday to Old Navy\u2019s business. Additionally, the second quarter is impacted by late units arriving in Q2 and potentially being sold at lower margins given that fall flows come in shortly thereafter.","Regarding your inventory guidance, excluding the impact from the port situation, we would have expected inventory dollars per store to be slightly down at the end of the first quarter. Given the fluidity of the situation, we\u2019ll provide an update on inventory later in the quarter.","Moving on to the impact of foreign exchange to the year ahead, at current spot rates, we estimate that foreign exchange will negatively impact our reported EPS growth rate by about 6 percentage points. This equates to about $0.16 or over $100 million of pre-tax earnings.","While comp is reported on a constant currency basis, the remainder of our reported performance is subject to currency fluctuations. As a reminder, our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan with combined sales in these two countries of over $2 billion.","Both the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar have depreciated by about 30% over the past two years. With the continuing depreciation of these and other currencies against the dollar, our reported results have been and are expected to be negatively impacted.","There are two primary impacts of foreign exchange. The first is translation and the second impact is the economic impact to our merchandise margin. We hedge the majority for inventory purchases for our foreign subsidiaries 12 to 18 months in advance. Effectively, this delays the impact of depreciating foreign currencies on most of our cost of goods.","However, as the old hedge rates lapse and new less favorable hedge rates come on, the cost of goods in local currencies will increase. In addition, unhedged inventory purchases will be subject to foreign exchange movements.","Moving to expenses and operating margins, we have a strong track record of managing expenses and we intend to continue that. However, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll leverage expenses in 2015. As a reminder, we are lapping the $39 million gain on sale as well less absorbing the increase to our minimum hourly wage that we announced last year.","Given the negative impact from foreign exchange, the port issues and last year\u2019s gain on sale, we expect operating margins to be down about a point to 2014 on a reported basis. However, excluding these three factors we expected operating margin on an underlying basis would modestly expand.","Here are some other guidance metrics. We expect to add 115 net new stores, with our year end store base in China into over 150 stores and Athleta store base growing to 120 total stores. Square footage is expected to increase about 2.5%, we expect capital expenditures to be about $800 million with the increased focus on omnichannel and supply chain capabilities, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $525 million and we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%.","Finally, we remain very committed to our principle of returning excess cash to shareholders, underscoring that commitment we are pleased to have announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and our intent to again increase the dividend to $0.92 per share. As we enter 2015, we remain focused on using all of our levers to further drive value for our shareholders.","Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Art.","Art Peck","Thank you, Sabrina, and good afternoon. It\u2019s really a pleasure to be here addressing all of you.","And before I go into anything concerning the business and looking forward, I would be remiss not to thank Glenn for everything that he has done for the company, his tireless effort over the last eight years, what he brought the company in terms of vision, strategy, discipline, and most importantly results and I have to thank him as well for everything he did as we worked shoulder-shoulder over the last few months during this transition time. We as a team feel that he was incredibly helpful to all of us in effecting a smooth transition, in sharing his perspective on what we need to do going forward and then allowing the team to get settled in to hit the ground running in 2015. So again, I need to thank him on behalf of myself and the team for everything that he has done.","So I\u2019ve been in the job now for officially about three weeks. I am very bullish on the future of this company. We have great brands with tremendous potential, I am extremely pleased with that being that is now in place and equally pleased with the consistent sense of urgency that every member of my team has in making the changes that we need to make to compete successfully and consistently.","Product is critical for us and consistent product season after season appropriate to our brands is nonnegotiable. As I look forward, I first want to talk about where we are today. Let me spend a moment and talk about the guidance that Sabrina gave to you.","To be clear, I fully believe in the economic model that we have articulated and that we have been executing over the last several years. That said, there are three issues that are going to affect our performance in 2015, the two are macro issues with foreign exchange and the port situation and the third is the performance of Gap brand.","I want to double-click for a moment on Gap, none of us are satisfied with the performance that we are seeing at Gap. I made a very quick change with senior leadership there. I did this because we were not seeing the performance improvement in the business that we needed to see and specifically I was not seeing the women\u2019s product back on track the way it needed to be for the brand to perform to its potential.","Jeff and I are together focused on what we need to do in order to get the brand back on track and it starts with riding the women\u2019s business. There\u2019s an aesthetic issue which we\u2019re working on today with urgency, we\u2019re pleased to see that the denim business seems to be showing signs of life, but Gap as a brand is much more than denim and we need to have the women\u2019s business hitting on all cylinders in order for the business to deliver the performance that we expect.","2015 is largely bought, really through fall right now, Jeff and the team are focused on making product changes that they can make, but those will be modest and incremental until we get to the late in the year. Holiday is under significant scrutiny now, I\u2019ve looked at it, Jeff has looked at it, the team is focused on it to make as much improvement as we can before you buy the product. Let me quickly refresh your memory.","In early 2011, I sat in the same seat that Jeff is sitting in right now at Gap brand. I know from my experience and I\u2019m sharing this with Jeff that we can get the brand back on track quickly with a relentless focus on products.","When Jeff got into his role, he moved quickly to make some changes on his team. The obvious hole has been the leader of design and I\u2019m very pleased to announce today that Jeff has hired Wendy Goldman who will be rejoining our company in a new role as Head of Design and Product Development for the brand.","I\u2019ve gotten to know Wendy over the course of the last few months and I feel very confident that she will be a strong creative leader and a significant addition to the team. She knows our company from 8 years here early in her career and more importantly she brings her experience from a very successful 11 year run at Limited Brands. Again, 2015 is going to be a year of hard work in getting the brand back on track. But I am very pleased that we have the team largely in place who will be doing that work.","Now that said, I am bullish on where we are overall as a company. The consistency of performance that we\u2019ve seen with Old Navy really premised on the back of season after season products that is on trend and on brand gives me a deal of confidence and it\u2019s the product work that Stefan and his team have done around how they think about trend, how they build the assortment, and how they line up all elements of the business to express the brand consistently through marketing, product and in-stores.","I\u2019m very happy with what I\u2019m seeing with the team at Banana Republic. Andi has excellent taste, she understands the brand and she has been one of our most consistent operators inside the company having worked directly with me in a number of roles. Andi and I both expect more from the brand.","April is Marissa's first product flow. We saw fall presented last week at fashion week to a very good reception and reaction. And so we\u2019re committed to continuing to move Banana forward, the proof is always in the product that we\u2019re putting in the stores, but we\u2019re excited about what we see and have high expectations.","Let me spend just a moment then on Athleta. We\u2019re excited about what we are seeing there and we are excited about the continued growth both in the active space and in the space where active meet her ready to wear wardrobe. You also have seen, given how excited we are, the fact that we continue to push on fit inside of Gap and on the active expression inside of Old Navy as well. And so this is a space that not only through Athleta, but as a company, we\u2019re very committed to.","Over the course of 2014, we made significant progress in the omnichannel space and we are very excited about the customer response there so far and we are pushing forward to roll out all of the capabilities across our brands in North America as quickly as possible.","On top of omnichannel I just want to spend a moment really more broadly on experience. And if you've been following some of the changes that we've made, you would have noted that we brought together the traditional marketing activities and our digital business inside both Gap and Banana Republic. Why am I excited about that? I am excited about that because today the digital expression of our brand is the primary way that our customers engage in our brands. And if you look at our traffic, the bulk of our traffic is coming into our digital properties and I'm convinced that going forward we will win or lose at our digital leased line.","Historically, our websites needed to be and have been tremendously effective and efficient channels that our customer bought through. We need to continue to be that going forward, but our digital expression of the brand needs to be more than that. It needs to be aspirational, holistic, emotional, in a way that few people have expressed their brands digitally. And we are focused on doing that across all of our businesses.","I want to spend a minute on global growth. Glenn and I worked shoulder to shoulder to create this strategy and growth that we have been pursuing at consistently over the last several years. It is my intent to continue to pursue growth and obviously through all of our brands and most importantly through Old Navy's expansion into China and Japan. We continue to open stores in China with the plan for this year being about 40 stores, which is consistent with our store opening over the last year or so as well.","Let me close just by coming back to a little bit to where I started. I'm very excited to be sitting in this role. I'm very optimistic about the prospects that the company has in front of it, I'm also very asked and objective and have a great deal of urgency about some of the work that we need to do to get parts of the business back on track. I can give you my strong assurance that I and my team are resolutely committed to doing what's necessary in order to make that happen that as quickly as possible.","Thank you. Katrina, I will pass it back to you.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now open the open up the call to questions and we\u2019d appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Barbara Wyckoff with CSLA.","Barbara Wyckoff","When will Gap and Old Navy be in a place where they can react in season to accelerate the flow of bestsellers through the fabric platforming initiatives? And if it's not happening yet, when will this start to occur? Thanks.","Art Peck","So here is the reality, we are actually set up to do that today and we are continuing to grow that capability not just in Gap and Old Navy, but across all three of our big brands. It logically connects to the question obviously of the port situation and I\u2019ll address that proactively here which is that with Gap in particular, the port situation for one thing, that is something that is very short-term and really outside what we've built in terms of our responsive supply chain, we've reacted to that through logistics and I'll let Sabrina talk more about that, I'm sure that will come up.","With Gap and the aesthetic corrections that we need to do, what I'd like to be able to tell you is we can correct it with the response in supply chain capabilities that we've built. The reality is that we're more rebooting some of the aesthetic elements with brand, those are capabilities that are set up to help us more in season with chase and open to buy and those types of things. So it's really the little bit disconnected from the palm that we have in Gap right now. But I'm working very closely with Sonia Syngal, who is our Head of Supply Chain and Product Operations, as well as the brand presidents and these are capabilities that we've talked about before, we are continuing to build them and we are very bullish about their ability to impact the business.","Operator","And we will go next to John Morris of BMO Capital Markets.","John Morris","I guess kind of a big picture question for you, Art. You touched on a number of the initiatives. I think we can get a pretty clear sense of the priorities you've got mapped out, clearly likely beginning with Gap women's. But beyond that, maybe first of all, if you can talk a little bit more about how you would rank those other priorities? What you really want to address in the coming year, but also an eye towards any initiatives this year that might be different from the course that was charted most recently in the past under Glenn. Thanks.","Art Peck","So clearly, Gap is at the top of my priority list. As I said a few minutes ago none of us are happy with the performance, not me, not Jeff, not the team, and so we're , very focused on fixing that as quickly as possible. If I look back and step back from that a little bit, as Gap is doing that work to itself right now, there are the broader strategic priorities and we will talk more about those obviously over the course of next several months. I would remind everybody that I think I'm day 26 or something like that, so still bringing the team together.","That all said, and I said this before when we spoke a quarter ago, I don't want to communicate at all that there is going to be a big shift at the end of our priorities. Product is absolutely critical to us and underneath product as a priority, our responsive supply chain capabilities, our seamless inventory capabilities, fabric platforming, obviously design and design talent, all supercritical. And when I'm talking product inside and outside the company, it\u2019s on brand, on trend product, but consistently. And that consistency issue is one of the things that I'm really focused on.","And in the second issue is really for me its experience and on the experience it's the omnichannel, the physical and the digital experience and how all of that comes together. So it's really about, in my words, powering up our focus on those as much as anything rather than deviating from them. And then, of course, global growth which I referenced and I just want to come back to which is we are committed to continuing to build out our global structure and to put consistent product appropriate to our brands and on trend season after season, not a lot deviation at all from those as our priorities.","Operator","And we will go next to Adrianne Neve with Janney Capital Markets","Adrianne Neve","I was wondering if you could \u2013 obviously it goes without saying that product is paramount, but if you could address where you see further opportunities to incorporate technology into the business to either drive sales or improve and enhance the operational aspects of the business? Thank you.","Art Peck","Some of what we \u2013 and I appreciate the question, that was a good one for me, since I'm passionate about this as well as a number of other things. I think as we said, we are really continuing to push these omnichannel capabilities which have been for us more, what I would call, spot capabilities, so reserve in store, shipping from store, finding store, and now we are testing mobile POS which we talked about before, knowing now how the customer is reacting to those, having learned a lot about how it comes together to form a customer value proposition and now starting to integrate them into a more holistic offer, that's really the focus and it's going to be the focus over 2015.","We are testing mobile POS right now, which is really, as we've been talking about, as we push our POS to really a cloud-based POS that brings all of our web services in, we've been testing that on a small device in stores and both the sales associates and the customers have been reacting incredibly positively for that. And so it starts to open up a number of things for us, different ways of interacting with our customers, giving the sales associates those tools, different ways of engaging with those customers in a sitting room where we can actually get a transaction done. Of course, you pivot back to what does that mean to the real estate that we currently have committed, the church that we've built for Easter Sunday, if you will, with all of the registers at the front of the store, can we start thinking about putting some of that real estate to more efficient use and underutilized registers for much of the year. And so those are all things that we're absolutely focused on, it's well past proof of concept both in terms of technology as well as how customers engage and you will see us continue to push those out over the course of this year.","Operator","And we will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities.","Simeon Siegel","What's the right way to think about the other segment sales and profitability line as you guys close Piperlime and any update on the intermix business and the opportunities there? Thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","So the others primarily going to be Athleta, Intermix and Piperlime. It is being impacted your point by the fact that we are winding down Piperlime. So that's one of the primary impacts. Athleta continues to be on a very good path, so we are very pleased with the year and how it's all gone.","Operator","And we will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Lorraine Hutchinson","As you think about product purchases for the back half, what are you seeing in terms of average unit cost and does that have an impact on how you plan on pricing your product in the back half?","Sabrina Simmons","I'll start with that and then if Art want to chime in that would be great. With regard to average unit cost, we've talked about the fact that spring didn't really have a lot of change, because when we placed spring there wasn't a lot of difference in the cotton prices, we started seeing benefits in summer and certainly in the back half. So that's all good news. Directionally when you do the math on what component cotton is to our total AUC and I'll just do something high level illustrative for. If you have the 20% improvement in cotton it equates to roughly about 2% improvement in AUC and that's before we make any mixed decisions or any other changes to our assortment. So it's super helpful, it's a positive thing, but it's not an enormous lever even into the back of. Again, but it's helpful.","With regard to pricing, I would say given the promotional environment we've been living in, that is not really a great case in my view for changing pricing and giving that back to the customer. Of course what we will be looking to do is trying to return to help the margins in 2015, so that could be a lever, some of it offset by foreign exchange. But the cotton tailwind could be a lever and then we will be managing our promotional cadence to try and also support healthier margins in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","I was wondering if we could focus on Athleta for a minute. Plans to only open 20 stores this year seems like a slowdown from growth over the past several years, so just wanted to think about how you're thinking about growth for that specific brand? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Art Peck","I'm actually very glad you asked that question, so let me just step back for a second and talk a little bit about the journey that Athleta is on. Obviously, started as a catalog and then an online retailer, we only opened store a few years ago, and as we've opened these stores, the number one store in the market and then the follow on stores in that market, we are really learning a lot about kind of building a retailer from the digital world, if you will, into the physical world and how the two channels interact with each other.","And what they've learned is very positive, which is that we can build stores and we can continue to get the growth out of the direct channel at the same time, which is obviously great growth, accretive growth and really attractive from that standpoint without having to put physical assets in the ground and so I have no modification in my mind in any way shape or form about the growth rate and the growth prospects of the business just as we are learning about how we get that between the two different channels, we are trying to be really responsible obviously and optimize the overall returns of that business by the differential growth rate in the two channels. So if you or anyone is interpreting this as somehow we are losing a little bit of for optimism for the business, that's absolutely the wrong interpretation.","Operator","And we will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you. Art, I wanted to ask you about the supply chain and I'm trying to reconcile two comments that seem a little bit contradictory. You indicated that you've got current capabilities to be able to respond in season to bestsellers and adjust your merchandise flows. But I think during your prepared remarks, you said that you're basically in 2015 already bought through fall here at the end of February. So I'm just trying to understand how those two things happened simultaneously? And is there a point in future years where you think we'll be sitting at the end of February, not bought out for the next six to eight months?","Art Peck","So I think I can resolve the potential inconsistency that you see there. And part of the issue is that, just being very straightforward on this, with everything that's been going on at Gap, they are probably on the lagging side of having implemented some of the supply chain capabilities. And so even now with Jeff coming in, Kimberly, we are actually taking a pause and we will be shortening our product calendar, number one at Gap.","And then number two, pushing much more aggressively on some of those things that in season or close to being in season allow us to be very responsive like an aggressive push on fabric platforming and those kinds of things. And so while I am bullish on this, I see this working in our other businesses, I wish Gap to push further forward because it would give us the ability to be a little bit more responsive right now. They are not as far as they will be very quickly.","And then the other issue is, if you look at it, let's rewind from fall, fall is sometime probably in early August, so it's actually not that far away right now if you consider the production cycle on motion times et cetera et cetera. And so I don't think it's contradictory at all and will definitely pushing forward on this. I wish Gap was in a different place, but they are the laggard as it comes to implementing this and that is something we are correcting right now.","Operator","And we will go next to Susan Anderson with FBR Capital Markets.","Susan Anderson","I was wondering if you could maybe expand just on your vision for the Gap segment, what needs to transform there? Do you think it's all product or is there any other structural pressures going on, given the entrance of new competitors? And then do you feel comfortable with its store base, given the focus on e-commerce and omnichannel? Thank you.","Art Peck","That's funny because I remember sitting in our design center in 55 Thomas in October of 2011, and the question was asked it was similar to that when I was in Jeff's seat. And as of February 2012, when we really had on brand and appropriate products that was really aligned with the trend of the season that was the new bright marketing campaign that the product to market and then we saw very, very good numbers come out of the brand almost instantaneously with getting the product back on track. And so I'll be honest with you, right now, Susan, I'm really much more focused on the establishing the aesthetic direction in the women's business and getting product in our stores that reflects what our customers expect with this product that is feminine, product that has an optimism associated with the, obviously casual product with an American aesthetic and I know there is upside associated with doing that.","And then we do that and that gives us the time to then look at any other issues. I would also just refresh the memory that while I was sitting in that seat, we closed a couple of hundred stores and had made very good progress there from the standpoint of really rationalizing the fleet to be in the kind of real estate that we felt a brand like Gap should be exposed. And so right now I want to stay focused with Jeff and the team he has put together on getting the products to aesthetic right. The other thing I will say here again is that and as we talked about, we have a very good men's business, the kids and baby business remains healthy for us and the fit and Gap body business is a good business also. And so for me largely this is a women's business right now and it's what our focus is on.","Operator","And we will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Regarding your focus on your feature here, regarding the aesthetic direction, are you thinking that the women's tops \u2013 which classifications might have the most opportunity? And then how do you think you can attempt to marry the great efforts for consistency versus creative and balancing the art and the science of retail? I'm most curious about the Gap division and what kind of observations we should look for as we check the stores.","Art Peck","I can see you thinking about the business in the right way, not surprising. Right now as I mentioned, we are seeing a little bit of life in denim and the resolution denim has gotten a pretty good reception from customers. They are really finding that the like the whole notion of it, the fit, the fabric, obviously denim has been, I characterize as this, customer has taken a bit of a pause in women over the course in the last several quarters, and I would say as much from our business but also having just been in New York during fashion week and seeing what was being talked about, what was on the showrooms, what the news was in denim, I'm not going to call it a turn in denim, but I'm feeling for the most part \u2013 I feeling now differently than I felt for a while which is probably coming back to denim in a way that we haven't seen her be for several quarters. So encouraged there, but it's early days.","Tops is tough right now, and it's wovens and knits, it's a fit issue, it's a fit intent issue, it's an aesthetic issue and so we are very much focused on that and with much focused on fixing that as quickly as possible. And so if I had to go to one category, I would definitely say it's in the top's business and obviously both knits and wovens for Gap brand are very material categories and the product is just not \u2013 she is just not responding to the product there right now at all. So we just stop there, I mean that is the work that we need to do.","On the issue of the tension of consistency and creativity, I actually think that's [indiscernible] let me just give you an example. Fit, so fit in bottoms, fit for us which is a huge issue with respect to a women's loyalty towards her pants. We should be the experts of fit, we have been experts at fit and shame on us when we lose consistency on it, because when she can't count on us. It also as you might imagine has an impact on the business to business, because if she counts on fit and the fit has changed then we obviously have an issue with returns right now. And so fit consistency is a science, it's a discipline, in no way does it impede what we need in terms of the great creativity of design teams.","And so I guess I worked in other creative businesses during my career and I've always calm that rather than being a trade off between consistency and discipline and creativity on the other side, consistently and discipline enables creativity and frankly it takes a lot of the work away from what the team has done, has to do at the end of the day. So and this is really the reaction I see from our design teams as well, they want to win and they want to have a foundation that they can build on every season.","Operator","And we will go next to Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner","Just going back to Gap brand again, for a second, Art, I just wondered, you've described what you're going to be doing, but what should we look for? What should we see in the stores as we move through this year of transition, I guess?","Art Peck","So the words that use when I describe Gap which I think are very relevant are casual optimistic and American. And if you haven't been in our stores and looked at our assortment, I would suggest you need to, but I suspect that you have. And I would challenge you to find that we are consistently expressing casual American optimism through the product expression that we have in our stores. And so those are the words that we were using and now, what does that mean tangibly? So in summer what you will see as there is some more \u2013 it was a very neutral summer that we had last year, you will see more color, brand appropriate color coming back into the business by the time we get to summer. So that's a change that has been made.","Print and pattern obviously as we get into late spring and summer, not so much in spring, but you will see a bit more of that when we get into summer as well and then as we move into fall, there is little bit more and then the work that's going on right now on holiday, it's holiday for Gap is really a time we are very optimistic expression of the brand, it's a time when a lot of the industry tends to go to a very dark and neutral place, we have done very good business over many years with the more optimistic expression of the brand during that time frame.","It doesn't mean going nuts on crazy type again, go nuts on [indiscernible] some of the other sort of trends perhaps that you see during holiday, but we have an opportunity to express the brand in a very optimistic and colorful way there. It's also obviously in a feminine way, which is the other piece that's missing from the women's business. And so I'm not going to call a turn on the business right now, being very honest with you about the work that's going on and when you will start to see some change and I'm not promising anything that we will get later the year, but I think even as we get to summer and the fall, you will start to see the brand shift a little bit more to the express \u2013 through the appropriateness of the brand.","Operator","And we will go next to Thomas Calandra with Susquehanna International Group","Thomas Calandra","Question about the marketing. I think the overall spend was only up slightly, so I was hoping you could remind us what the incremental spend was for the Gap Brand in 2014. And, Art, given your digital expression comments, how should we think about dollar spend in 2015 and any adjustments to the mix in the spending? Thank you.","Art Peck","I\u2019ll let Sabrina grab the specific number if she wants to talk about that. I would rather go to a slightly different place, which is to really talk about the change that we made in the structure of digital marketing and it\u2019s something that I did very intentionally and I did it very intentionally in the two brands that we did it in, under two leaders who I know very well and I think are enlightened and very capable leaders. You\u2019re going to want to know what is that mean at the end of the day and that we just give you a couple of things that would probably tell you that talk about.","Our brands are being engaged digitally much more so than two traditional marketing vehicles and the good news about digital engagement is we have a much better line of sight to the return of our spend in digital engagement versus some of the traditional marketing vehicles like a billboard or a transit or those kinds of things. And so part of what I am trying to do by bringing those two things together is to really get our arms holistically around how the customer is engaging our brand and then start managing that for the highest returns in our overall spend.","And I\u2019m not going to say that we are going to spend less marketing but I am honestly pretty confident that we\u2019re going to be able to see a path towards evolve into higher returns on the marketing spend that we have across a number of different vehicles.","The second thing which I have highlighted that I want to highlight again is that we have had the luxury of living with our digital expressions of our brands, our websites, as being very efficient transactional channels. Today to me it becomes a hand, which is those digital properties also have to carry the aspiration and the emotion of the brand as well as being very efficient channels.","And by bringing those two things together, we really now have leaders in an organization that\u2019s going to be thinking digitally first in everything they do and [indiscernible] which is if you\u2019re shooting marketing assets for traditional marketing vehicles, often times those assets don\u2019t manifest themselves in the best way possible for digital use. And we just need to pivot to a digital first mindset. I do believe we will get some efficiency out of doing that, I am much more excited about the effectiveness of our overall spend that we\u2019re going to see.","Operator","And we will go next to Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez","As you think about the issues facing Gap Brand, Art, I'm just wondering if Gap internationally is facing similar issues, or have they out-comped the North American business? And also specifically, if you could comment on how Gap China has performed both for the full year and in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Art Peck","It\u2019s kind of a mixed bag quite honestly and really depends as a function of couple of things. Obviously how the assortment was bought and how the team in a given part of the world would pressure on different parts of the business. In some places in the world, like in China as an example, our kids and baby business index was much higher into the overall business than the adult business and that business has been pretty consistent and pretty strong and so she is what I would say.","As we\u2019ve had the same product issues, the product issues in North America, product issues everywhere, in that we have brought the business different and the customer engagement, the business is different, we\u2019ve seen level of strength in China as an example that have been better than what we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world, I don\u2019t know if Sabrina if you want to talk at all about specifics in China business?","Sabrina Simmons","We don\u2019t break out very much, but I think directionally that\u2019s appropriate. I think we had more success in China certainly then we saw in North America with the assortment and a lot of that is how it was bought in China and the favorable mix in kids and baby, which continues to be more of a relative strength.","Art Peck","The other thing I would say just to put a period at the end of the sentence, we\u2019re confident that as we make progress in the women\u2019s business it will have an impact around the world.","Operator","And we will go next to Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Chen","I was wondering if we can shift gears for a moment, Art, and talk about Old Navy? Just had a great quarter to wrap up a nice year. As you look at the brand, what are some potential opportunities for the brand going forward and when we may see that play out to 2015?","Art Peck","So if I just step back and look at the opportunities for the brand, opportunity number one is consistency, season after season and that\u2019s what gives me probably more excitement than anything about the fact now that we\u2019ve had a little bit of a run there with consistent product, which the customer has consistently responded to. I would also really point you to the expression of the brand in no marketing.","I follow them \u2013 probably the best place that I go to honestly to see it is on Instagram, I follow Old Navy and a number of our other brands as well as a number of other brands and there are times when I look at Old Navy's inventory on Instagram and it's hard for me to distinguish between a premium or premier contemporary brand in terms of the aspiration of the fashion that we are presenting. And so Stefan uses the word aspirational, I think it's a great express and that you see \u2013 when you see those brands against each other, how Old Navy is really communicating the fact that it's got current trend that is right where it needs to be right now and clearly that's what she and the overall family was responding to.","Still bullish obviously for the Old Navy, so that's in the domestic business. Given the consistency, there is a long runway in front of us there in terms of opportunity. Very bullish on the international business and the expansion that we have in both Japan and in China, and then a couple of places worth highlighting inside the assortment. I touched on the fact that Old Navy has a family wide active expression, we've had tremendous customer reaction to that, she is really engaged, and she is engaged on behalf of the family, kids, the men's business, the active expression, and that's a place where \u2013 if that's a trend, that's a trend that's got a long runway in front of it.","And so we're excited about being able to build out that business. And it's a business that is essentially purely incremental for us inside of Old Navy. That is a real estate to house the business, we are not having to trade off other key categories, so it's a very nice incremental business for us, it allows us to build the business, productivity in the real estate and give another reason to come inside the store.","Operator","And we will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Sabrina, I wanted to follow up on currency. The guidance that you have for the translational and transactional headwind in this year's earnings guide, does that also include some of the cushion or the protection you got from hedges that have been in place? And as a result, as we're thinking about our 2016 model, I know you haven't given any specific guidance, but as we're looking at out-years, should we also be thinking about a currency headwind to factor in? And then as part of that question, this isn't your first moment dealing with currency, do you guys have an approach, a plan of attack, on how to defend margins, whether it's through pricing or cost savings? Have you considered, maybe in Europe, diversifying your sourcing capabilities to include some local manufacturing or any other initiatives you're taking to protect margins from this? Thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","On the first question, it definitely, Lindsay, includes the hedge rates embedded, so the guidance includes the hedge rates for 2015. And as I mentioned, we hedged about 18 months in advance, so the hedge rates tend to lag by about 12 to 18 months. So they worsened again that they didn\u2019t worsen to the degree that they did coming out of 2013 to 2014, but that is all embedded.","With regard to how we look at the spending margin that, I would say we look country by country certainly and we don\u2019t feel like in a lot of other countries, given the competitive landscape and the orientation towards value of the customer, that there is a lot of room to just full sale increase prices given the increase in AUC driven by the stronger dollar. What we look at more is how do we affect and address the issue through our promotional cadence through our sales and mark downs, I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been trying to do overall for the last year and a half as we\u2019ve been facing the pressure already, and we\u2019ll continue to look at sourcing mechanisms as well. As we move forward, since we\u2019re probably be in the dollar strong environment for a little while here.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva","Happy to have made it. I guess the question to Art, as you think about reinvigorating the Gap Brand, how do you think the target customer demographic has changed here over the last couple years? And how do you segment the market between Gap and Old Navy, just to make sure the brands are different enough to coexist in the marketplace? And to Sabrina, just to follow up on the guidance, are you embedding any of the buyback activity for 2015? Thanks","Art Peck","So I will take a quick pass at this and then I\u2019ll hand it off to Sabrina. So let\u2019s be clear. We participate in almost $2 trillion global marketplace for apparel and accessories. And so as a company that has $16 billion roughly in revenue, there\u2019s a lot of space out there. As to the target customer for Gap, I think I am less focused on the target customer than I am on the fact that Gap at its best has historically been a pretty democratic brand.","And what gives me the greatest pleasure is to see a woman with her daughter, either a young daughter or her adult daughter, shopping in the brand and that is exactly what we saw back in 2012 and in 2013 when we had products well priced, appropriate for the brand that was on trend in our stores. And so I\u2019m a little less in time to embrace sort of the two-dimensional cut out of a target customer rather than great products that\u2019s right for the brand and for the aesthetics for a brand with probably a good business.","And then as to our brands completing with each other, my basic perspective on that is get the best products you can through your brand filters and there is a lot of competition out there to go indeed. And I\u2019m less inclined to think about our brands competing against each other than competing with both fits against our competitors and winning every day.

Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, I do want to talk about the quarter and the performance of Gap Inc. in Q3. I want to talk about the announcement from a month ago of the move of Gap Inc. to global brands. So let me start with that.","A month ago, we announced that our business made a structural change that will be effective in February 2013. In 2008, Gap Inc. was an American-centric channel led business. That was completely the appropriate structure for that time. But we've been on a journey. We have been moving the company at a pace that we're comfortable with, you could never go from an American-centric organization to global brands without having stores in China, without having online that was launched globally, without having outlet stores internationally. As those proof points came together, it made sense, this was the right time to move to a global brand structure.","This was driven by the customer. Customers clearly are becoming more and more global. As we go around the world and all of us travel, there's more in common than I've ever seen between a customer in New York, in London, in Tokyo and Toronto and Istanbul. So from our perspective, looking at our business globally is very important, to have one lens, one management team looking at the brand across all different channels in all different international countries. What we're expecting to get out of this change is speed, for sure, with one team deciding across every touch point we have to the customer. We're going to get more efficiency, which is critical. This change definitely puts the brand ahead of channels. Channels are important. And the corporate strategy has been clearly identified as multiple channels. But this is putting the brand first. And secondarily, it's about global over local. Local is important. We need to understand the local needs of our customers, in Gap brand in particular that operates in over 40 countries. But this is the global approach to the business first. And this structure from my perspective has definitely been put in place to fuel long-term growth. We've had a good year so far on growth. We want to have strong growth every single year looking forward, and this structure is going to be an enabler to that kind of performance.","Now let me talk about the quarter, and I'll look at it a couple of ways, one domestically, internationally, and also give you a little bit of commentary on our growth initiatives.","Domestically, the business had an 8% comp, that was a very good performance for our domestic brands. Now what is encouraging as I talk to you about in the second quarter, this was product-led. Our product teams delivered the product to our online business, to our stores that allowed us to get to this kind of comp, and it's key categories. Everyone of our brands has been strategically saying, what's the category? This comp is an outcome. You have to have a plan across the categories where you want to differentiate yourself, how can you get a competitive advantage? Where do you want to put your inventory, your marketing? Drive those categories to get to a comp, and that's what we saw in this quarter. The other thing I want to talk to you about is we've been working on more of a wear now approach. There's been a couple of transition seasons between summer and fall, and winter and spring. I think as a business, we've lost market share. So this quarter more than anyone I've seen in our past was much better executed in that transition of product. And that's why our comps were strong in August and September.","And lastly, we had very good reg price selling. Selling more products online and in our stores at regular price is a metric we're watching closely and does talk about long-term health of the brand. On the International business, we had a minus 3% comp. Now our total sales were on par with our domestic business, and that speaks to Old Navy Japan, our China business, our franchise business, but our comp of minus 3% is something the team is focused on. We would like to see the International business improve that trajectory through the corrective measures they are taking. Let me give an update on the company's growth plans.","Our franchise team has opened in 8 countries already, with 1 more to go. So a very big year for that team in terms of number of new countries. We opened up in Japan online. So now Gap Inc. has an online presence that we control. In Europe, in Canada, in the U.S., in China and now finally, in Japan. And if our strategy, which we are so committed to multiple channels and to multiple geographies continues to produce the results we hope, this was a critical step in that direction. In China, we're very comfortable with the performance of our business. We're on track to open the number of stores we've committed ourselves to. The milestone in the third quarter was we opened 4 outlet stores in China. So in November 2010, we opened up 4 specialty stores with our online business day 1, and here we are, less than 2 years later, opening up our outlet centers in China, which we believe will be a nice opportunity in that country.","And lastly, Athleta continues to perform very well. And most encouraging in this quarter is now we've opened up stores in all different kinds of real estate. We have street stores, we have mall stores, we have lifestyle stores, we have strip centers. And what's been impressive is how well Athleta performs in everyone of them. That opens up lots of opportunities for that brand if it can perform at this level going forward in all different types of real estate, that makes the brand very flexible.","Let me close by mentioning we know it's been a very difficult time for people on the East Coast, dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Gap Inc. has 28,000 employees that were in the path of the hurricane, and what was primary to us was the safety of our employees, nothing is more important to us than that, and we're so happy that by all accounts, our employees are safe and sound. They've been impacted like so many other people. That's why I want to encourage you on the phone, if you haven't given, please give money to any cause, give to the Red Cross, give to the Salvation Army. People are in need even 3 weeks after this horrible event. We're in the fourth quarter. We've been preparing for this for many, many weeks. We know how important this quarter is. We're 2 weeks in, but this quarter now is all about execution. How we're going to execute in the stores? How we're going to execute online? How we're going to execute in our outlet channels versus our specialty channels? This is what it comes down to. I think our team has shown to continue to be even better at execution, committed to it. And this is a quarter where you want to go out, you want to have the right product, the right marketing, you want to gain share, and you want to win. And that's our goal.","So with that said, let me turn it over to Sabrina to take you through the financial performance of the third quarter.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our third quarter performance as we continue to make meaningful progress against our stated 2012 priorities including: driving increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently investing in our business and growing earnings per share.","Here are some highlights for the quarter. Net sales were up 8% and comparable sales were up 6%, with all North American divisions continuing to post positive comps. Operating margin expanded by 380 basis points to 13.5%, and earnings per share grew 66% to $0.63.","Please turn to Slide 4 for our earnings recap. In the third quarter, operating income was $520 million, up $174 million and net income was $308 million, up $115 million.","Turning to Slide 5, sales performance. As customers continue to respond favorably to our product, third quarter total sales were $3.9 billion, up 8%, with comp sales up 6%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Turning to Slide 6, gross profit. Gross profit dollars grew by 21% to $1.6 billion. Third quarter gross margin was up 450 basis points to 41.2%. Our merchandise margins were up 330 basis points, driven primarily by decreases in average unit costs. Rent and occupancy leveraged 120 basis points.","Turning to inventory on Slide 7. With the benefit of average unit cost coming down during Q3, we were able to sell more units while managing our total inventory dollars tightly. As a result, inventory per store in terms of dollars was down 4% at the end of the third quarter.","Please turn to Slide 8 for operating expenses. We've noted throughout the year that we plan to invest more in our businesses during 2012, and highlighted that it's likely we will de-leverage operating expenses. In line with that framework, third quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up $105 million from the prior year, with an ongoing focus on the areas of marketing and store payroll. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses de-leveraged by 80 basis points. Marketing expenses grew $29 million to $178 million, driven primarily by ongoing investments in Gap brand marketing and CRM.","Please turn to Slide 9 for capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $449 million. With regards to company-operated stores, we've opened 32 stores on a net basis year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,068 stores. Square footage was down 2% compared to Q3 2011. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.","Regarding cash and share count on Slide 10. Year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of $776 million, and we ended the third quarter with about $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Year-to-date, we spent $463 million on share repurchases, including $96 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 480 million shares outstanding.","And now I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Please turn to Slide 11. Given our progress year-to-date, we are raising our estimate for full year earnings per share, which includes the 53rd week to $2.20 to $2.25. In addition, we are increasing our full year operating margin guidance from about 11% to about 12%. As a reminder, it's our objective to continue to drive consistent top line growth while delivering healthy merchandise margins.","As we lapped last year's average unit cost increases, we expect fourth quarter merchandise margins to expand.","In terms of inventory, inventory dollars per store at the end of Q4 are expected to be up in the low single-digits versus last year.","Regarding operating expenses, we plan to continue to invest in areas like marketing and store payroll. Therefore, we expect the increase over last year in operating expenses in Q4 to be at least as large as the 11% increase in Q3. And as a result, we also expect to de-leverage operating expenses in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to cash. We plan to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically, though it's important to note we consistently stated we expect the level of share repurchase to be more modest in 2012. As a reminder, our third quarter weighted average diluted shares were 488 million.","Regarding our effective tax rate, we now expect our full year rate to be about 39%, down from our previous guidance of about 39.5%, driven primarily by tax credits.","The following full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged: Square footage down by about 1%; company-operated stores about 15 net openings; capital expenditures about $675 million; depreciation and amortization about $475 million.","In closing, we're very pleased with how we executed against our strategies in the first 3 quarters. As we enter our most important selling season of the year, we remain committed to executing on our financial goals while continuing to make improvements and investments in our business. Thank you.","And now I'll turn it over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Betty Chen with Wedbush Morgan Securities.","Betty Y. Chen - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Glenn, if you can speak a little bit more in terms of the commentary about each brand successfully pursuing key items or key categories, how -- were there any learnings in terms of how those strategies played out? And what can we expect in terms of Q4?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, the categories that we've been focused on, that's really been for at least the last 15 or 18 months. I think you have a combination of 2 things going on. We talked about this back in the call in February, our sort of refocused design, merchandise and inventory teams, about what are the key businesses that we clearly see us gaining market share on, that are right for the brand, define the customer, can be marketed properly. And as I said in my commentary, really provide either a competitive advantage because you have a product asset and a point of differentiation against our competition. So I think the teams have been very much focused on that. I think there may have been a moment in time where I think we were probably just spreading our focus a little too broadly. Now I've always been a believer that if you have a set of categories that hit all the criteria mentioned earlier, Betty, and then you can bring in new businesses and new categories, because the only way we're going to be at a comp consistently is to focus as I've said on -- about those key categories and product assets that each brand believes in while looking at new business opportunities that one day could become possibly, a product asset. So I think that it's that marriage of those 2 that allows the business to get an outcome of positive comps. Now on Gap, no big surprise. You've got the denim business, which our LA office, working with the New York office and all those teams, I really think that they've delivered since spring, a denim offering that has not only driven and lifted the overall business, but I think has been bringing in the right customer, which is critical to Gap's marketing strategy. And on top of that, another, of course, are the product asset for Gap brand is it's Baby business. I think those 2 just as examples have really helped propel the kind of comps you've seen at Gap brand and domestically. In BR, again no big surprise, suiting has been a very strong business for us. Men's and women's for the last 3 quarters, and we've complemented that with woven tops, which was stronger in men's for a long, long time, but it's nice to see this year a little bit of our investment in products has gone to women's woven tops. And that's also been a very strong business for us. At Old Navy, it's been denim, but really a focus on the Rockstar jean, which is a little bit of a higher AIR. Hopefully, through that you materialize to a higher AUR. But the fit, the colors, the marketing have all come together. That and the Kids business at Old Navy, especially in Q3, where the team I think did an exceptional job on back-to-school. So execution of the plan for the last 15 months has been good, but I think it's that combination, I spoke about earlier, that's important to me being right strategically, right on the execution, looking at new business opportunities and therefore, the goal here is to have momentum on the comp performance in our global business. But in this quarter particularly, our domestic business was very strong.","Operator","Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner with Caris & Company.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wondered, Glenn, if you could talk about regular price selling. Clearly, you're driving more of that business with regular prices. But I just wonder where you are now relative to history and where you think the levels of regular price selling can go from here? What opportunities do you have over the next quarter and the next year?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, Dorothy, I have to say we're just coming off 2008 and 2009, I think that the business probably lost perspective of what a healthy brand, which we have 3 brands, what that looks like and therefore, what one of the measurements of success of a healthy brand, which is how much -- what percent of your units go through at reg price. This has been the best year we've had in a long time. So I've been pleased with the step up. Now that's a -- obviously, it starts with the right decisions being made on product, I was saying to Betty earlier, that all holds true towards reg price selling. I think inventory management had a tough a tough year last year. It was difficult for them with the huge increases in AUC to buy right. That probably didn't help in our goal last year even to try to get to better reg sell price. There's been some really good decisions being made. I think a little bit of that is process changes, some investment in systems, I think that has certainly helped that team. Then you have the marketing investment we're making. And then lastly, I would say that our store team have been much more focused. And I think we've been flowing the product to them that allows them to capture a better opportunity on reg price selling. So we have really been pushing new arrivals. I'm not going to give you the number, but the percentage of weeks now that Old Navy flows new product, it has -- I don't know this for a fact, but my supposition is, it has to be the highest it's ever been. The number of weeks that Old Navy receives fresh, new product. So you put that all in combination, and we've had a good year on that front. Now what I will say to you that we have a long way to go to get to the numbers I think that all 3 brands should be at. I think that's going to -- it's really going to happen through consistent performance on the product side and consistent execution and marketing. But the team's commitment, and I think our customers' response so far -- a big thing I've always believed in that we've done a decent job of, but not as well as I thought we could have, our actual initial pricing is very sharp across the different brands, different customer groups. If you look at the initial pricing at Old Navy, at Gap, at Banana Republic, it's very good. So our goal midterm and long term is to reduce our dependency on having to get off those prices because they are very good. And this is really a global strategy that you're seeing being applied much more focused now in Europe, in Japan and in China. So I think the teams are pleased with the performance so far. But to answer your question, I think this is really early days for how high the bar can be for these 3 brands on reg price selling. Now it helps having Athleta in the business because we realize how high is high, because their reg price selling is very attractive. It's been helpful too that Stefan joined the company because I think he has also been giving us a feeling from his perspective of what healthy looks like when it comes to reg price selling. So I think those are just 2 other sort of data points that have reinvigorated the team to be committed to this metric over the next number of years.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk a bit about the traffic that you've seen? I know in the past you've mentioned that the traffic that you've gotten for your value businesses had exceeded Gap and Banana is -- is that still the case and can you talk a bit about the contribution from AUR as well?","Glenn K. Murphy","I will start with the traffic and then Sabrina can give you some insights on AUR. That trend still holds true. Our value businesses being made up of Banana Republic Factory Stores, Gap Outlet and Old Navy, their traffic is still noticeably stronger than it is at Banana Republic and Gap specialty stores. So I think -- if I just give you one sort of approach we're taking. Gap brand, we've been putting more marketing behind the brand since spring. And I think we've all been clear here that as we try to get more new customers, some lapsed customers into the business and ultimately move that traffic metric, it's going to take a little bit of time. There's a lag effect that's going to take in Gap brand. We're committed to the marketing. We're committed to our messaging. We're committed to the new mediums, in the areas we're investing, but we -- the team knows that there's an expectation, that as we keep giving them more funds in marketing that at some point, we're going to -- at some point, we've explained to them there's a date we want to see the traffic be much -- on a much better trajectory than it's been so far in specialty. It's not a disaster. It's just not what we believe it should be long term. And that's again the health of the business. As I was answering some of the questions earlier, I think when you're talking about better product and you're talking about better inventory management, focused on key categories, that again being consistently done, is the ultimate driver of better traffic. But marketing is something that we've taken very seriously this year, and we've been again, we've been pleased. There's always improvement in our value business. We've been pleased. The third quarter was I think another -- another better performance by our 3 value businesses in terms of traffic. But we'd like to see Banana Republic specialty and Gap specialty start to change the trajectory they've been on, on traffic. And so we'll watch that in Q4, and we'll see how we do.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, and Erika, regarding AUR, the quarter actually played out very similar to how we've framed it up on the Q2 call, which was, we stated that when -- with AUCs coming down overall, we were going to be introducing more units into the system to get Old Navy, especially back to a normalized level of units per store after last year. And with that reintroduction of units, we expected that the growth rate in AUR would not be as high as it was in the first half. So in fact, in Q3, overall, AURs were up just very slightly. And that phenomenon was really driven by Old Navy. So that implies that, of course, Gap and Banana did better on AUR. But overall for the company, up modestly.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can look out to 2013 and beyond and just talk about where you see the opportunities to drive your business to the next level. And what are the strategic priorities internally to drive both sales and margins higher over time?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I think we'll probably have a lot more to say on that front in February in terms of what those levers are. But suffice to say, look, we -- one big one that we've talked about publicly, but it's also part of some of the performance improvement we've seen this year, and something we believe in long term will continue to add value to the business on the operating margin side, is this shift in our mix of our business towards where the customer is. And it just happens to be where we think we have a competitive advantage against our global competitors. So the customer is certainly moving more and more online. That's not a new story. But we have invested properly in that business. We will talk more in February about what our version, which I'd like to think is a little unique to the omni-channel approach that's going to be across our 3 brands, and how we've set ourselves up. And that even though we're making the change to our global structure and making online and outlet and specialty and franchise all part of one leadership team, what I said in my opening comments, I think one of the benefits of making that change is the speed of decision-making and the move on that strategic front at a faster pace than we're going to see. So we put one person in charge of all earnings across the brand, one amount of capital that, that global brand president is going to be. One thing I know about capital, it tends to go to where the biggest opportunity is. So I think the online business will grow -- continue to grow much stronger than our specialty business. But I think that even at that delta can even grow over time as we get to this new structure and start putting the infrastructure in place to execute our version of omni-channel long term. Our value business, defined as Banana Republic Factory Store and the Gap Outlet business, I think again globally, still has a long, long way to go and huge opportunity. So you may have heard us say this before, Kimberly, but I think our strategy against our global competitor is right. I think we have a competitive advantage. I think the customers are moving both aggressively and accepting more and more people going to either power centers, value centers as lifestyle centers get transitioned. Globally, again, power centers, value centers, and we have a channel that appeals to that customer to where that growth is, same with online, and we've obviously been pretty clear about this. The best return on sales and the best return on capital the company has is on those 2 channels. So I think that the new global brand presence, looking at the brand holistically will move much quicker, even though I think we've moved at a decent pace over the last 3 to 4 years. That's to execute on that strategy. I think that's going to give the company -- execute it properly, will give us nice earnings growth going forward as we change the mix of the business.","Operator","Our next question is from Adrienne Tennant with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My question is on the inventory units, particularly at Old Navy. It sounds like the build is weighted toward Old Navy. So I just wanted to know whether there was going to be unit build at Gap and Banana as well? Should we expect the AURs to be down and should we expect a comp acceleration? So are you kind of hitting the AUR so that we would see increased market share gains?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, I think overall, Adrienne, we're trying to ground on trying to get Old Navy and the value channels, but especially Old Navy back to a normalized -- so we're not really changing our model from history. It's really that we're comping a year that was unusual in '11. With that very high average unit cost, we pulled out a lot of units because from a total cost inventory perspective, we didn't want that ballooning too much. So this year, with that coming down, we're actually trying to just reintroduce units to a level which are more comfortable from any historical velocity level that we would see at Old Navy. Now of course, our hope in all of that is to continue as our overall goal is for the company, is to continue to positive comp in a manner that has us gaining some market share. So that is our overall goal. But we want to do that with healthy margins. And we think with this average unit costing providing us some nice tailwind, we don't need a very large increase in AUR to still give us obviously, nice margin expansion. So that's sort of the formula. Delivering a nice, positive comp is the goal that gives us some market share in a way that also provides very healthy merchandise margins.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And AUR should be up, is that what you're implying slightly?","Sabrina L. Simmons","No, no -- I would -- we're not guiding to AUR, but I would say reminders are -- I just said in Q3 that it was only up very slightly, and we're entering probably our most promotional season of the year. So we'll see how it turns out.","Operator","Our next question is from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Sabrina, I was wondering if you could talk -- you just mentioned your AUC tailwind. As I recall, the fourth quarter of last year had the steepest level of input price increases. So I'm wondering if we could look for incrementally higher sourcing reductions here in the fourth quarter, and therefore, some additional opportunity for gross margin gains. And Glenn, I was -- I'm curious about the timing that you might consider for incremental marketing dollars at Old Navy. You spent a lot at Gap. Old Navy has had a nice turnaround, and I'm wondering when we might see the marketing start to pick up for that brand.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, so I'll start with your gross margin question, Janet. So to be helpful, because we don't give explicit guidance on that line, but to be helpful, definitely, it's true that our peak costing last year was at holiday. The differential between fall and holiday though was that not that enormous. So I don't want you to think that, that's some big differential that we're moving into. But for sure, holiday was the peak. In -- across Q4, we'll of course complete selling fall, mostly holiday, and we'll start selling spring. So there's a mix of seasons there. All of that said, it's true that holiday should have nicer tailwinds on the AUC. I think what we'll see how it works out is on the AUR, because again, it's a promotional season. We have great plans, we feel really confident about. We're going to be in there with our -- especially at Old Navy with a great lineup of promotions. But we're selling a lot more units. So that might be a bit of an offset. So yes, on the AUC, and we'll see how the AUR turns out. But margins should be healthy.","Glenn K. Murphy","And on the marketing front, we're actually fairly pleased with the amount of marketing that Old Navy has, and we don't see ourselves making any kind of move above where they are right now on a relative basis until when Stefan gets more settled in his job, because he's been -- this is month one for him. And him and Michael Francis and myself, spend a little more time together probably early in the new year discussing Old Navy and its creative platform that supports its brand positioning. And I think more than anything, as I've talked to Michael quite a bit over the last 45 days, I think Michael what he sees is an opportunity to change the mix of our marketing and maybe get a little more bang for our buck like some other brands out there. Maybe we're a little too married to our television exposure. Television and Old Navy go hand and glove. There's something about that brand, about its customers, about the audience, and how it really resonates. Hopefully, we'll see that as the television kicks in next week for Black Friday, and the weekend after Black Friday. But the creative I think, the work that Michael has done since he's been here, which is really looking not only about the creative positioning of Old Navy and all the tools and mediums available for us, but how do we get more for the money we have. So still to be determined. I think the 2 of them are spending lots of time together. Michael's adding some great value already. I think early in the new year, we'll sit down and figure that out. Obviously, I'm always a big believer that if there's a justification, and we're going to get something from it that in this case, could be whether it's traffic driving or whether we introduce a new category or there's some other reason, I'm sure we're open to it. What I also will say to you is, don't forget Old Navy in 2013 steps up a little bit more globally, and we're going to have to start looking at some marketing in the Japan market to make sure that brand gets off to a strong start. So I'd be more focused on putting some incremental money there than do anything domestically. Because again, worth repeating, I'm pretty comfortable with the amount of money they have right now.","Operator","Our next question is from John Morris with BMO Capital Markets.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So my one question is on International, Glenn, and a little bit relating to the global restructuring that you've talked about. You talked in your prepared remarks about taking some corrective measures for next year. So if you can elaborate a little bit more on what those are and the goals that you're hoping to achieve? What are the yardsticks you'll be measuring and how does that fit in with the global restructuring repositioning? Obviously, that would have some impact on that.","Glenn K. Murphy","I would say that some of corrective measures I referenced -- I'm hoping that some of them will be helpful sooner than 2013. A big area that's changed. The first step we took towards global brands was in the spring summer of 2011, with a number of changes we've made in the company structure. One that gets to the corrective measure comment you just made was to bring one International leader, Stephen Sunnucks, who is now going to be our Global President for Gap brand, and he brought all the International merchant teams together, hired an amazing lead, who's now going to run the global merchandising for him named Liz Meltzer, who has a history at J.Crew and Uniqlo. And what Liz did, and you'll start to see some of that work show up in the market just now, in our franchise business, in Europe, in Japan and in China, was really bringing all of that -- all of those teams together under one strong view on assortment architecture and pricing architecture. Now we weren't so divergent that you wouldn't know it was Gap brand. I actually in my comments at the beginning what I said was, possibly up until this year, we are a little more local at the expense of global. And that's fine. I was -- I was trying with the other executives in the business, we were all sitting back and trying to find out what is that right balance? Clearly, with some of the work we've done, some of the research, some of the customer work we've done around the world, the decision through the new structure was put global first and local second. In keeping with that, the work that Liz under Stephen's leadership have put forward is that, you will see now a much more consistent approach in our assortment around the world, not identical because we are such believers in local opportunities. What I believe is going to happen now is, they will now be able to go, instead of an inch deep and a mile long, they will be able to go an inch wide and a mile deep on what really differentiates Japan from China, from Europe, from some of our key franchise markets. That work is already beginning. Now we're not going to get a huge benefit in the fourth quarter, but I am expecting that some of the changes they've made will be the beginning of some of the course correction action. That, coupled with our pricing, I was talking earlier that we've actually pretty good with our initial pricing. I actually feel in North America, we're highly competitive for the customers we're going after against the competitive sets of each one of our brands. I probably couldn't say that with as much confidence internationally until now. And I do think that again, under the leadership of Stephen and Liz, our International business is much more competitive in this fourth quarter, and therefore, going forward with its pricing architecture. So those 2 of many actions that have been taken while Stephen led the International business, hopefully will start to change the trajectory we've seen in that business for the last, I don't know, 5 or 6 quarters now.","Operator","Our next question is from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the profitability in China in that greater region? And maybe the timeline around how we should expect that profitability to improve?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, we don't segment report that, Evren, but what I will tell you is that, it's a long-term investment. It has been dilutive, but its profile has been improving. And we expect a nice, big step in that improvement for fiscal '12 as we will probably for '13 as well, and as they keep adding stores that are doing nicely. We talked about the fact that doing business in China has its complications and requires more infrastructure than doing business in more developed markets. But we think it has great potential for our long term. So we're definitely invested there for the long term, and we're making good progress against that dilution.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My question, as it relates to your global realignment, are there other functional pieces of the business that needed to be changed now that you've kind of reorganized at the top of the house, and how do we think about expense build as it relates to this infrastructure longer term?","Glenn K. Murphy","Yes, no, I think that clearly, nobody should be making the assumption that the restructuring we made and the repositioning of the brands to a global view is going to add cost to the business. That's not what the intention behind it was. As I said earlier, we're going to get speed. One of the big benefits we're going to get is that and a more common approach as we shift to, as I said earlier to the global local approach to our business, the Gap brand in particular across over 40 countries. We've actually, since 2007, I'd say let's call it to the service functions in the business between finance and HR and real estate and supply chain and IT. I think the business under Sabrina's leadership have done a great job making a very efficient service model to the brands in place. And those services were already global. So the infrastructure on which the brand sits were already global, and we're leveraged, and we've been doing a great job on that front. This was a change related to brand level only. It will sit on the exact same infrastructure we had before of shared services, where we've continued to actually get great benefit and efficiency from that. So this is really a change that I think is customer facing, that will get the benefits I talked about earlier. Now you have 3 significant leaders who run all of our big iconic brands, and I think that it's early days. Those teams don't officially start working together until the new fiscal year, but we're confident that we're going to get the outcomes I talked about earlier.","Operator","Our next question is from Jennifer Davis with Lazard Capital Markets.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess I'll stick with the International theme here and I was just wondering if you could maybe give a little more color, Glenn, around trends in Europe and Japan by brand. I think the Old Navy store is doing very well in Japan. I know it's very early still. I believe that Gap Outlet and Banana Republic are doing better than full price Gap. So I guess could you maybe just give a little more color around, like I said, Europe and Japan and the brands?","Glenn K. Murphy","I think that your assessment is actually pretty much spot on. Both in Europe and in Japan, I'd say our Banana Republic business, our online business, and our factory store value business is doing quite well. And not in that order. Well, obviously, online businesses which are young in both the 27 countries we serve in Europe. And as I said earlier, Japan just opened a month ago. But earlier indications of Japan are very positive. The online business in Europe is very strong. And look, we've been making the same sort of approach that we've had here in the U.S. Making sure the stores are right. Focusing on key cities in Europe. Making sure we're investing and remodeling the stores that make sense, and we're going to hold on to long term. And as the customer starts to return, and I would not say in Europe we're seeing any signs of that just yet. There's some numbers just came out in the U.K. And once again, the customer apparel numbers were soft in the U.K. for October. So there's no -- there's no great sign right now in Europe. You saw H&M's numbers that came out today. So we don't have a large business there. We have an important business. We're keeping it tight. We're investing in our value sector and online, and that's it for now until we see signs of real improvement inside of Europe. In Japan, where the consumer is slightly better, our Old Navy business, as you said, is 1 store only. We'll comment in February about how many stores we're going to open for Old Navy in 2013. But we feel very good about the first store. Online I think will be an amazing add-on to the bricks business we have right now. And there, again, it's Gap specialty. The team is on it. I was answering John's question earlier, I think some of the work that Liz Meltzer has brought to the business, early indications will be in 2013, about how that change -- those corrective measures are going to take place. A little bit in the fourth quarter, but I think we've taken a lot of steps to get our International business performing at a higher level for Gap specialty. That's certainly not been an area we've been pleased about. But I think the team we have confidence in, and they're going to take some of those ideas now. They're going to go into the brands, and I believe the brands will execute that strategy and find even more ways to make sure that our International business performs better in 2013 on a top line basis than we've experienced so far in 2012. But more to come on that front.","Operator","Our next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies & Company.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Glenn, could you just talk about -- you mentioned some of the process changes and systems changes, can you expand upon that a little bit for long-term sustainability of improvement in the business? And then if you could, you said something with regards to Stefan talking about how to be best-in-class or what have you. So can you just, if you could, give us your thoughts on what he said were opportunities in the Old Navy business for us?","Glenn K. Murphy","Look, I think that what I was saying on the inventory management, one, you've got a few new people particularly at Old Navy who've come into the business, and I think they've been instrumental in making some process changes that we wish we probably would've undertaken some of those in 2011. But again, in fairness, 2011 was a very difficult year for our inventory management team with this change in -- of this paradigm shift of average unit cost to inventory units that they bought. Having said that, I really think that the process changes I'm seeing driven at Old Navy, but some of this applies to Gap specialty and Gap Outlet, Banana Republic Factory Store and Banana Republic specialty business, that the inventory teams I think are doing a much better job in 2012, and I'm actually feeling that any system investments -- and look, everybody is always putting some kind of money to their inventory management system. I think that we're just making sure those teams have all the right tools. But as we look, and we'll talk more about this in the new year, as we look at our business because right now, we've been talking about how inventory can be viewed more seamless from a customer perspective between channels. So we've been doing a little bit of that work right now on our ship-from-store strategy, which allows us to take product that is in demand online and ship it from one of our stores. So we've done a lot of work on that front. We'll talk more about that in the new year. But I think one of the next moves even though there's been some small investments that have been helpful in 2012. The big shift for us is how do start treating our inventory that's seamless to a customer across channels of online and specialty, and across geographies most importantly. I think that's going to be critical looking forward for a business like ours. And there's a lot of value to be created by doing that. And Stefan, look, it's 30 days. I just think that, we didn't hire him to come in and just oversee the status quo. We brought him into the business because we believe his experience, which is phenomenal, and his view of retailing, whose knowledge of specialty retail and of fashion in particular. His work he has done on processes and making sure that company's like ours learn to move faster because that's really going to be important going forward. The customer is moving fast, therefore we have to respond by moving equally as fast. I think that early days, but I'm just impressed with some of the observations that he's making, and I'm sure as shareholders and investors on the phone turn to 2013, there'll be an opportunity for everybody to meet him. And I'm sure he'll be happy to share some of his observations, what he thinks is great about Old Navy, which obviously, that includes a lot about the brand and its positioning. But what are some of the opportunities that he thinks he's going to put into place and what speed to create incremental value for shareholders.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Glenn, just curious about your view where we are, I guess, in the real estate portfolio side of the business? Sort of, where are we regarding sort of remodels, store closings, footage reduction and sort of which brand or 2, do you still think has the best opportunity for productivity, recapture as you start -- try to think about getting beyond last year or 2's, operating margins?","Glenn K. Murphy","I just -- with David Zoba today, who runs our global real estate, and he's been pretty consistent about this. We're thinking we'll end this year on our domestic real estate strategy. I'll come back to Europe in a second. But our domestic real estate strategy will end this year in the 7 or 8 inning of the plan we outlined to investors in 2008, so I think -- hats off to our real estate team who have done a phenomenal job. So by the end of '13, I think when you look at square footage reductions at Old Navy, I think we'll pretty much be there. We look at Gap closures, pure closures and then consolidations, I think we'll pretty much be there. Banana Republic was never a big change, but there's some changes that were necessary in Jack Calhoun's fleet. Those are for the most part done. And I think that the move now domestically is to look at these missed opportunities for the Gap Outlet business and the factory store business. We just opened up a store in Fulton Street in New York City, where the specialty business would not get the kind of customer traffic it needs given its value proposition. We put in a Gap Factory Store there, and it's doing phenomenally well. So I think that as we've tightened up the real estate for all the right reasons, there's a few opportunities still available for us domestically. And when Katrina was giving out or maybe when Sabrina was giving out the net number of stores in the quarter, I always think about, this is a year where we're going to open close to 200 stores. But we have a lot of closures this year because this was a very big year for us for closures. We have one more year to go of repositioning in 2013 and meaningful number of closures, probably not as high as '12, but we'll give you that information in February in 2013. And then we'll be able to be in a place where we're not operating like we had the last 4 years, with quite a few closures per year that dragged down the company's total sales. So I think that good performance by the real estate team -- I'll deal with 2 issues that you brought up at the end. Remodels, we're still very happy with the remodel work at Old Navy. I'm sure Stefan will have a point of view on that, but we've been very happy at the work that's been done. We've been very happy with the Gap global model. We just opened on 34 Street in New York, just reopened beautiful store doing very well. So very happy with how that store looks and how it's coming across. I think Jack Calhoun has continued to tweak the remodel prototype for Banana Republic. So I think that it's good, but I think he is tweaking it. So I think we feel good about our models. Athleta, obviously, is very strong. And lastly, if I was to say there was one area where productivity is the hugest -- sorry, is the most significant opportunity for us on productivity, that would be at Gap brand specialty. All our brands have an opportunity on productivity, but Gap brand specialty, with a repositioned fleet now in terms of number of stores and square footage, I got to believe Mark Breitbard is looking at that and going, that's the biggest opportunity for him is to get better productivity in his new fleet.","Operator","Our final question for today will come from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the average unit cost dynamic, fourth quarter sounds like that's the optimal peaking event. How should we think about the evolution of that? And how do you prioritize what's going to be the biggest positives for gross margin after you kind of wind down the average unit cost benefit?","Sabrina L. Simmons","We're going to talk more about '13 on the Q4 call, Oliver. But obviously, we'll start to lap sometime in '13 really good costing. So we still have lots of great sourcing strategies ahead of us. So we're never done looking for opportunities to get optimal costing using fabric platforming, our new category management. So we have lots of tools within sourcing to keep optimizing costing. But certainly, we're not going to have the magnitude of tailwind that we've been experiencing this year. We obviously, are focused on great assortments. So part of the sustainability of moving forward with our positive comps, which is our objective, is going to be to keep making investments in those smart areas, where we think we can get the average unit retail for it. So we keep those healthy margins. But mostly, it's going to be a continuation of healthy product acceptance and modestly introducing more unit sales once we've achieved that healthy merchandise margin, so we're growing our gross margin. So that's going to be the recipe going forward into '13, and we'll give more details as we enter that year.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I may as a follow-up, what is your thoughts around your parameters for making a decision for investment in the future versus harvesting returns on the fixed cost side?","Sabrina L. Simmons","What exactly -- you want to restate that, maybe I'm not sure...","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just how are you thinking about going forward, this year, you're deleveraging in terms of the infrastructure investments...","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes, got it, I think. Absolutely next year, I mean, this year was an important year for us to take some steps in reinvesting, and I think we we're prudent about where we took those measures, especially with regard to the pockets of product we reinvested in and the marketing investments. Now that we'll be anniversary-ing those, and we're definitely looking for return on those investments, we will be looking in '13 to go back to a more traditional economic model where we should be leveraging our expenses. So that doesn't mean that nominally, the expenses would go down as we grow our sales. You might expect us to go up obviously, but we would look to return to a more balanced economic model, where the expenses are leveraging.","Katrina O'Connell","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder, our earnings press release, which is available on gapinc.com contains a full recap of our third quarter results, as well as the forward-looking guidance included in Sabrina's remarks.

I would now like to introduce your host, Jen Fall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Fall","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements as well as descriptions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, as noted on Page 2 of the slides supplementing Teri's remarks, please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filing with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 17, 2017, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining me on the call today are President and CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Teri List-Stoll. As mentioned, we will be using slides to supplement our remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Arthur Peck","Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I will turn the call over to Teri in a few moments, and she'll share more details on our Q2 results. But before we do that, I really want to zoom out for a moment and talk pretty specifically about what separates Gap Inc. from the retail apparel pack.","I often see us referred to as a \"mall-based apparel retailer\". And I think that's one dimensional probably at best, but really, it's just flat out wrong. We have clear points of advantage that are intrinsic to our business and set us apart, first, our portfolio of iconic and I would underline, profitable brands; We're using our product capabilities to lead in loyalty driving categories to drive our business; We have a very robust, very profitable online and mobile business that meet our customers exactly where they are; and we have scale, and we're using that scale to drive advantage growth and profitability.","Let me spend a moment on each of these. First, our brands. Again, we'll talk more about each brand's Q2 performance later in the call, but no other apparel retailer has a better, more diversified collection of profitable brands. Individually, they have unique strengths and unique opportunities for value creation. In Athleta and Old Navy, we have 2 growth brands, both have significant runway in front of them. Gap and Banana, they're more mature but also profitable and where we're focused on driving improved performance and cash flow generation and at the same time, responsibly and aggressively managing our exposure to struggling mall real estate.","We also have a very strong value position in our portfolio. Over 60% of our total business is in the value segment across Old Navy and our outlet and factory expressions. I think people sometimes miss the fact that value for Gap Inc. isn't limited to Old Navy. It extends to Gap Outlet and Gap Factory store and Banana Republic Factory store, and we are in many non-outlet mall locations with profitable stores in both of those businesses.","Underpinning our strong profitable portfolio brands is a financially healthy company with ample capacity for investment in growth. Teri will spend more time on this. But just to reiterate, we remain conservative on our leverage levels, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, all while maintaining a healthy level of investment in the business and returning cash to our shareholders.","Last thing here I want to point out is that, yes, we operate a lot of stores. The bulk of our business is in stores. But we have taken an aggressive and strategic approach to our real estate footprint and have proactively shed more than 5 million square feet in North America over the last 10 years. It's also important to point out that our real estate portfolio is very diversified. We have stores in strip centers, lifestyle centers, street locations, et cetera, and our stores are in places largely where customers are living their lives today. Our approach to real estate is disciplined and it's balanced. We also see opportunities to responsibly invest here particularly in the value space.","Second, because we're not a single brand company, we are able to leverage multiple capabilities, including product creation, innovation, vendor relationships and others across the portfolio to take the lead in key categories that drive loyalty. I'll talk about loyal categories -- loyalty categories as we continue to talk going forward. But these are categories that drive repeat customer visits and a long-term relationship, categories like denim and bottoms, active and kids and baby. And we can build the best, most innovative and differentiated products in these categories because of our scale and our portfolio.","Let me give you one small but important example. Stretch denim is the rage across men's and women's. The issue with stretch denim is sometimes it doesn't stretch back, and so recovery is just as important as stretch. Acknowledging this -- that this is a consumer satisfaction, we work with our vendors to develop several fabrics across all of our brands that offer excellent stretch, excellent compression and excellent recovery. And almost simultaneously, we expressed a new jean inside of our business from $108 price point inside of Athleta to a $50 price point in our value expressions. It's a product that customers have responded to, and it's a product that meets a real consumer need that has been enabled by our scale and by our portfolio. And we're also seeing it move the needle. We closed the quarter with an almost 8% market share in denim and 40 bps increase over the past 6 months in the denim space. ","Active is another key area. The U.S. active market is $40 billion with an 8% annual growth rate, 1 of the highest growing segments in the industry. We have a business in this space, over $1 billion across the enterprise, and at the end of the quarter, we ended with a 3.5% market share and a 20 bps increase in our market share. So again, bringing innovation, scale in our portfolio to bear, we are seeing the needle move in these loyalty categories from a market share standpoint. We've established a center for innovation in our headquarters in San Francisco and is focused on technical and sustainable innovation across the portfolio, where we're bringing technical fabrications as well as embedding new and differentiating performance attributes into our ready-to-wear collections across our portfolio brands. ","Another simple example, we introduced Rapid Movement Chino in Banana Republic a few weeks ago. It delivers everything you want in a work-appropriate, classic, clean chino pant. It also has amazing stretch for comfort. It has stain resistance and is out of the box, we believe, this is a winner, that we have a winner on our hands here, again, by driving innovation across the portfolio.","Kids and baby, another category where we have unique credibility with parents. Between Gap and Old Navy, we have almost 10% market share in the $30 billion U.S. kids and baby market, and we see significant incremental opportunity to drive loyalty with parents. To date, we've made great progress in Old Navy, growing to almost 6% share in the category. Honestly, we still have work to do in Gap, but we know we have very strong equity in that brand as well.","Third, we're meeting our customers exactly where they are, which today means having a robust, easy-to-use, fast, online and mobile business and a multi-channel, multi-brand presence. We were early movers in the digital space, launching e-commerce more than 2 decades ago. More than a decade ago, we saw the power of our brands together and quickly migrated to one platform where our customers could cross shop all of our brands with one easy checkout. This scaled platform allows us to add innovation easily and also brands as we did with Athleta, as we continue to grow the company. I'm not aware of, maybe you can point out, any company -- any of our competitive companies that have multiple brands that offer a single cart shopping experience, and we know that this matters for our customers.","Today, we're one of the largest retail apparel e-commerce businesses in the world, and this year, we expect double-digit online growth with strong performance from Intermix to outlet. As we've grown the business to its current size, the economics also have remained very attractive. And we take a world-class e-commerce approach to this business. We iterate, we A\/B test. We run dozens of tests each month, things like new online product recommendations where we have just inserted a world-class product engine into our -- into the mix of our capabilities. We've also expanded mobile POS functionality. We've added new capabilities with our native mobile apps.","On the mobile POS, we've deployed mobile point-of-sale devices in more than 900 North American stores so far, and we've accelerated the mobile point of sale. We're seeing higher conversion rates, larger basket sizes and higher overall satisfaction scores and loyalty increases. This is because it offers both convenience as well as a different way of engaging our sales associates on the floor of our stores. And most importantly, a cross-brand, cross-channel customer is extraordinarily valuable to us as a company.","Underneath all of this is data, and this is another place where the scale of our business comes to bear. We're in the early days of turning this data into dollars, which allows us to build meaningful experiences with our customers. The highest portion of our revenue is driven by customers who shop with us across multiple channels and multiple brands. We're focused on testing new capabilities that will encourage repeat visits across all channels and all brands. And to grow our known customer base and build more meaningful relationships, we are piloting as we speak in multi-tender loyalty program in Old Navy, which will provide customers with benefits to shop with us, a more personalized experience even if they're not currently a credit card holder with one of our credit cards, which is where our current loyalty program resides.","Continuing to power our omni transformation, we've added capabilities such as Reserve in Store, Find in Store, Ship from Store, Order in Store, some as much as 5 years ago, and we'll be testing a new buy online, pick up in store program this next quarter. We aren't behind. We're ahead, and we are accelerating.","Finally, our portfolio allows us to play at scale in a way that we are taking advantage of we have a lot of runway in front of us. You've heard me talk about this before. Our scale drives efficiency. Our scale drives speed, and our scale drives profitability. For example, scale has been a critical advantage as we continue to leverage our responsive capabilities. We aren't asking suppliers to change processes for one small brand. And as we built these responsive capabilities, it is important for our suppliers to be deeply integrated into our own processes. We're doing this on behalf of a broad portfolio. And this is showing up in our numbers. For example, Athleta now has more than half of its bottoms business on responsive. And by responsive, I mean back in the styles in 8 weeks or less. And with that capability, they're driving double-digit growth year-to-date on top of double-digit growth in 2016.","Another example is vendor-managed inventory, which is a capability that we have had for several years. We've reduced the time to get back in the goods that are managed by our vendors. When we first moved to VMI, it took 12 weeks to get back in stock. Now the average is 7, and we will continue to get this number down even further.","And of course, as it does in most businesses, our scale gives us cost advantages. With strategic relationships with mills, we're able to platform more than half of our fabrics which enables higher-quality fabrications with significant cost savings and has also helped us dramatically reduce our product lead times. Our multi-year commitments in our production capacity, we also achieved significant savings based on our scale and volume purchases.","The remaining opportunity in front of us is to ensure that we fully leverage our portfolio scale to yield even more efficiency, modifying processes to be better and faster and cheaper.","These strengths I just talked about, our portfolio brands, our online and mobile business, winning categories and scale differentiate us. Teri will go over the numbers in detail. But let's talk about what's working for us and driving our results, and I'll start with Athleta.","We continue to go from strength to strength in Athleta, outpacing overall industry growth, and through the strength of brand positioning, unique product offering and a compelling storytelling, we are very confident about the future runway in front of this business. We continue to drive growth in our customer base. We're responding to customer demand for our Athleta Girl business, which just launched in spring of 2016, and we'll now have an expression of the Girl collection in every store this fall just as our competition is closing all of their girl stores. I could say a lot more about Athleta. Let me end on Athleta by saying I'm very pleased with the results and very confident and bullish about their long-term potential.","Next, Old Navy. Old Navy's pillars are consistently fashion, fun, family and value, and they continue to work. Among major retailers, Old Navy is now the fastest growing apparel brand in the U.S. In addition to strengthening our loyalty categories that I mentioned, we've seen exceptional performance in dresses, pants, knit tops and shorts, which have helped fuel the Old Navy business. And innovation matters here as well. Our phrase forward in Old Navy is frugal innovation. It matters to our valued customers, and we're constantly improving product quality at accessible price points across the assortment.","We're also continuing to feed the funnel and engage new customers. The Hi, Fashion platform, which was our brand voice pivot from celebrity content, combined with the Say Hi social campaign has brought the brand personality to life across all customer touch points and has driven higher engagement, content sharing as well as a 3 point beat to industry traffic pretty consistently during the quarter. We're going to continue to focus on unleashing the potential of this brand, and we also believe that it has a long runway for growth in front of it.","Turning to Gap and Banana Republic. They are, of course, our more mature but also profitable brands where we're focused on performance, cash flow generation and growing the value expression of Gap Outlet and Gap Factory store and Banana Republic Factory store. At the same time, as we have demonstrated for years, we will continue to responsibly manage our exposure to real estate in the specialty channel. Banana Republic specifically, as a reminder, I just put a new leader in place in May. We continue to see challenges but overall, feel that the brand is well positioned and is servicing a customer base with desirable demographics. For the back half, the team is entirely focused on stabilizing the business, fixing fashion misses, improving storytelling and continuing to focus on execution.","On Gap, Gap continues to improve its performance quarter-over-quarter versus last year with stable and steady, but I will not say yet, satisfying results. Q2 is an improvement over Q1 in both 1- and 2-year sales comps as well as excellent traffic trends compared to the industry. And I would underline that, excellent traffic trends compared to the industry. Gap's strong emotive global brand awareness continues to come alive, and the response we're seeing against our customer engagement efforts, our newest campaign, Meet me in the Gap, which builds through the course of the year, is resonating with the brand's core customer base as well as a new generation of customers.","There is still work to do. As you know, we've been prudent in rebalancing our fleet according to where our customers shop, and online continues to grow at rates faster than the market.","And quickly, Intermix, which we don't talk about very much. As I mentioned before, while small, Intermix has had an exceptional quarter with respect to the growth in digital sales year-to-date.","I want to turn the conversation over to Teri in just a moment, but before I do, I want to tie a bow around my comments today. The work that we've been doing over the past few years has been critically important to position us to where we are today, which is to deliver consistent balanced growth. When I say balanced growth, it's a very straightforward construct, number one, to continue to gain market share in key loyalty categories that drive the business; number two, to continue to invest in what is already a large, fast growing and profitable online and mobile business; and number three, to appropriately, responsibly and selectively add stores, starting with Athleta, following with Old Navy and selectively in the factory and outlet expressions of Gap and Banana Republic while at the same time continuing our decade-long track record of responsibly and aggressively managing our exposure to mall-based real estate.","Below the top line, we've demonstrated our ability to expand margins and we will continue to be aggressive and disciplined cost managers. Do the math. It's a very compelling value creation story that we are confident we can deliver.","Over to you, Teri.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks, Art, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of positive results. And as we entered the second half of the year, I'd just like to take a minute and reiterate our financial priorities for 2017, first, to capitalize on our initiative to improve product quality in order to grow sales with healthy merchandise margins; also, investing strategically in the business to strengthen our brand equity and our customer experience and to support growth; maintaining operating discipline to drive efficiencies and leverage scale; and of course, returning excess cash to shareholders.","So let's turn to the second quarter results. Continuing the trend of solid first quarter performance, we're pleased to have delivered another quarter of positive comps and to end the first half ahead of our original expectations. I'll walk you through the quarterly results and then talk about our expectations for the remainder of the year. As we noted in our press release, our second quarter reported results include a $64 million benefit from insurance proceeds primarily related to a gain on fixed assets destroyed in the fire at our Fishkill DC. We're excluding that impact in our comparisons to provide a better assessment of the base business.","So starting with sales. Our comp sales were up 1%, and we're pleased to have delivered our third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. Net sales for the quarter were $3.8 billion, a slight decrease from last year. The spread between net sales and comp sales is largely due to our international closures last year. Our Old Navy delivered a record net sales quarter with positive 5% comp. This is against a flat comp last year and is driven by positive AUR and conversion. In addition, the brand traffic trends meaningfully outpaced industry metrics throughout the quarter.","Improving sequentially from first quarter, Gap comp was negative 1% against the negative 3% last year, largely driven by improved product acceptance resulting in positive AUR. Banana Republic remained challenged as it's still too early to see the benefits of the leadership change Art mentioned. Comp sales were down 5% against the negative 9% last year.","Moving to gross margin. As we continue to capitalize on our initiative to improve product quality, we are pleased to deliver another quarter of gross margin expansion. When excluding the 2016 restructuring costs, our second quarter gross margin was up 120 basis points from last year to 38.9%. Again, excluding 2016 restructuring costs, merchandise margin was up 110 basis points from last year driven by positive AUR at Gap and Old Navy. Similar to Q1, our rents and occupancy leveraged 10 basis points, primarily driven by lower rents and occupancy expenses as a result of our international store closures last year partially offset by the preopening costs associated with our Times Square flagship location scheduled to open in the back half of 2017.","Moving to SG&A. Our second quarter total operating expenses were about $1 billion, which includes $64 million benefit from insurance proceeds. Excluding that benefit, operating expenses were up about $70 million when compared to the 2016 adjusted operating expenses. Similar to last quarter, the increase was primarily driven by an increase in payroll largely due to bonus accruals as well as resources added to support our customer and digital efforts that support our growth. Together, this represents over half of the increase.","Additionally, there was a modest increase in advertising. The increase was lower than in Q1 and lower than our original plan as we decided to shift more of our marketing efforts into Q3 to support the important back-to-school season. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 38.3%, while we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of about 39%.","So turning to earnings. Our second quarter earnings per share were $0.68, including about a $0.10 benefit from insurance proceeds primarily related to fixed assets. The adjusted $0.58 compared to an adjusted $0.60 in the second quarter of 2016. Now you'll recall, our previous guidance for the first half was down mid-single digits. Excluding the insurance proceeds, our first half adjusted earnings per share growth was plus 3% relative to adjusted EPS for the same period last year. So we're very pleased with the earnings progress, which mostly reflects the gross margin expansions we have mentioned and slightly lower SG&A versus our original plan due to strategic decision to shift that advertising into Q3. As expected, FX negatively impacted our second quarter EPS by an estimated $0.02 and the first half by $0.05.","Finally, as we discussed in our last call, we had expected to book about half of the $0.08 to $0.09 of expected business interrupted -- interruption insurance proceeds during the second quarter. We had indicated there was some uncertainty about the timing of the receipt of the recovery. We did not receive those in the second quarter, and our current view is that the full $0.08 to $0.09 recovery will occur in the second half. As a reminder, this expected recovery largely offsets expected elevated full year logistics costs resulting from the fire.","Moving to cash flow. Year-to-date, our free cash flow was $270 million, which includes about $59 million of insurance proceeds related to property and equipment. The lower free cash flow is primarily driven by timing of lease payments and the increase in inventory since the end of last fiscal year. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. Consistent with our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, we completed an additional $100 million of share repurchases in Q2.","So looking to our strength during the first half, we plan to purchase an additional $100 million in shares in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with 392 million shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we paid dividends of $182 million and currently have a dividend yield of about 4%.","Regarding inventory, we ended the second quarter with inventory up 5% to last year. Now to understand why we're comfortable with this level of increase, you have to deconstruct the drivers. About half of the increase was driven by an increase in in-transit inventory. You'll remember, we talked about that variability when we provided guidance on inventory levels.","Another factor of the increased cost is related to increased cost of inventory on relatively flat unit growth. We've increased our investment in higher AUC loyalty categories that I referred to such as denim as well as active and lifestyle. These are categories where we see margin expansion opportunity. On the unit side, the composition has changed with an increase in basics being offset by a reduction in fashional and seasonal basics.","Given the risk level associated with basics is much lower, we feel good about the composition of the inventory overall, and it's worth noting that our liable inventory is down year-over-year. And finally, there is a negative FX impact that's driving inventories up at the end of the quarter.","Regarding capital and store count. Our year-to-date capital expenditures were $275 million, consistent with our expectations. We ended the quarter with 3,179 stores, reflecting the closure of 7 company-operated stores on a net basis.","And with regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, as we've said previously, we believe we're uniquely positioned to turn the challenges the industry is facing into opportunities. Our first half results begin to demonstrate the strength of our brands and the initial benefits of our investments in product capabilities, omni-channel customer experience and brand equity. We feel we have more work to do there, but the proof points are there.","There's market share progress in this environment, and we're focused on providing customers a reason to continue to choose to shop our brands, categories and channels. Based on the strength of the first half, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 should be in the range of $2.02 to $2.10. This is excluding $0.10 of the insurance proceeds that we received in Q2.","Now a few things to note about the assumptions around our EPS guidance. Regarding SG&A, in the current year, we have incremental investments that we're making in the brands, largely marketing but also investments in the store environment and the digital and customer capabilities we mentioned. These have a disproportionate effect on the Q3 compares, and for the quarter, we expect a year-over-year increase in SG&A that will be slightly above the first half trend.","The drivers in the third quarter are as follows. First, we began to increase our investments in the fourth quarter of last year, so we are comparing against a lower base of spend in Q3. And as I said, we've shifted some of our Q2 marketing spend into Q3 to support the important back-to-school season. Beyond this, we will continue to lap minimal incentive-based comp accruals last year that will pressure SG&A in the second half. In addition to these factors, we expect continued investments around omni-channel capabilities and expenses related to the work we are doing around our global inventory assortment tools and our logistics network.","So to conclude, overall, we're very pleased with our first half results. They support our conviction and the priorities we have set and the strategies we continue to follow to differentiate ourselves as a company with a strong portfolio of iconic brands that can deliver balanced growth and create sustainable shareholder value. Thank you, and I'll turn it back over to Jen.","Jennifer Fall","Thanks, Teri. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","As you look to the back half gross margin, how should we think about the impacts that the fire had by taking some of the inventory out of the picture? And what are your expectations for gross margin in 3Q and 4Q based on that?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. So we're not going to provide specific guidance under the gross margin line. But as we said, we did learn something that we worked through the inventory reductions we experienced following Fishkill. And you've see us play that through this year as we've really driven the AUR and the margin expansion. The fundamentals of what we experienced in the first half will stay about the same. So we'll be pursuing the same strategies. And so from there, you can kind of draw your conclusions. But we generally feel good about the way the business has been approaching that margin expansion throughout the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Art, at the Gap brand, I guess, how would you rank assortment opportunities in the back half of the year? And then as you dissect the store, can you just elaborate on trends in some of your more loyal categories that you talked to and just how best to think about your ability to increase the mix towards some of these categories over time?","Arthur Peck","Yes. If I look at the assortment, and thank you, we're pleased with the improvement. We know we have more to do. If I look at the assortment, frankly, across the company but then focusing on Gap versus where we were a couple of years ago with the exception of a couple of categories inside of Banana, we didn't -- we are not experienced product -- we are not experiencing product acceptance issues either because of trend, fit, quality, whatever. And that would absolutely apply to Gap. We've had a little bit of softness in the Gap girls business, which we've been focused on correcting, rebalancing the assortment there. The bigger issue that I see, and I spend a lot of time in stores and talk to stores, is to continue to buy into some of the big ideas with more confidence. And that's where we've probably been leaving some money and some comp on the table.","And you'll see that happen where we will come out with a new flow. And again, these are not seasonal, typically, these will be more monthly in nature. We'll get some cute women's woven top or something like that into the store, and then we sell down very rapidly. Now we're able to get back in oftentimes much more quickly. But we still need to put more confidence and depth behind some of these buys. And I do believe that it represents an opportunity for us for incremental comp.","Matthew Boss","As a follow-up on the expense front, how are you assessing some of the investments that you're making, particularly in marketing? And then just longer term, potential buckets of cost savings over time as we think about just the 4 concepts and the change that's taking place larger picture in retail?","Arthur Peck","Well, let me take the first one, and maybe I can talk the -- toss the second one to Teri. Marketing, obviously, traditionally was pretty traditional with print and TV. We still do some TV. But a lot of it is digital. And when we're doing digital marketing, we have a much more direct line of sight to returns, whether it's customer acquisition or driving conversion or whatever it is. And so I actually feel like we have continued opportunity in front of us given the returns that we're seeing from much of our marketing mix to feel very comfortable that we continue to support the brands. And then you have -- and I'm not signaling a large increase in marketing but to continue to support the brands. And then you have in both Gap and Old Navy very convincing traffic beats that give us confidence that our customers are responding and we're seeing the footsteps into the stores. And so we're very focused on seeing where the returns are. In the same way, that if we're putting any incremental payroll, we're looking for that to show up in the P&L, et cetera. Teri, I don't know if you want to field the second one.","Teri List-Stoll","Sure. So on the productivity front, as you know, we've got a long history of being pretty disciplined in delivering productivity savings year-after-year. We've largely done it at the brand level with each brand optimizing its own operations, and we've started to move toward more scale. But there's a lot more opportunity for us as we think about productivity on a sustaining basis and an enterprise level for us to really continue to tap into that scale, whether it's scaling the actual activities or whether it's really just reapplying best practices faster and creating more standard processes that can be better, faster and cheaper. So as we've started to look at this, we do see a tremendous opportunity, as I said, on a sustaining basis to be able to deliver additional productivity that can help us fund some of the investments that we think will drive growth.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih","Art, I wanted to ask about Gap brand. The second quarter Gap brand comp notably accelerated on a stacked basis. So can you talk about the product improvement, where you are relative to your expectation? And was the negative 1% hampered by lack of inventory units? And then very quickly, Teri, if you can just -- the ROD leverage has been at about a flat comp breakeven for the past 3 quarters. So is that something that we should expect going forward?","Arthur Peck","Yes. Let me talk with the first one, and I'll again hand the second one. I think that was 2 questions over to Teri, proving that I can count through the numbers. I'm not going to quantify the comp that we've left on the table, but my gut tells me in being out and talking to the stores that I've seen enough smoke where the stores feel like they haven't had the inventory to really support the business where I know that we have an opportunity in not so much more inventory but continuing to balance the inventory and get it more behind and confidently behind some of our big ideas. And again, our responsive capabilities allow us to get back in more quickly, but we still have times when we go flat because we've sold through some of the items that are moving the business.","Where we are right now as Teri mentioned, I feel like we're in a very solid inventory position. I think we have very little inventory in Gap brand that we're going to be disappointed about its productivity. We were pretty light in some parts of kids and baby around the world. And we've gotten back in there as well. So again, I've learned my lesson in calling a comp turn, but as you noted, we are getting convincingly better season over season and on a stacked basis. And I'm really pleased with the progress that we're seeing, and I just want more faster. Teri?","Teri List-Stoll","So on the ROD question, we've been pretty consistent and nothing's really fundamentally changed relative to what it takes to leverage ROD. It's kind of likely in the low to mid-single digits, which reflects the fact that some of our store openings are in higher-end markets. We have the Times Square opening, so some of that's putting upward pressure. But in these last couple of periods, what we've had is the benefit of international closures that have offset it and brought us down to a lower leverage point. But on a sustaining basis, nothing fundamentally has changed. So it's still likely low to mid-single-digit comp to drive that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer.","Anna Andreeva","We had a question about the comp metrics during the quarter. I guess, did traffic conversion and AUR all improve sequentially across the portfolio? And I think you mentioned focus on value at outlets. Just curious, could you talk about what kind of trends did you see in outlet versus various mall types?","Arthur Peck","Yes. So on the levers, without going into a lot of detail there, as I mentioned, Gap and Old Navy have seen nice traffic beats relative to the industry. And again, that's validation of what we're doing in product. It's also validation obviously of the marketing and the effectiveness of the marketing. What I can say is that we've seen across all the brands a positive sales less traffic, and so that would tell you we're also seeing excellent execution inside the boxes for the most part. We're monetizing the footsteps that are coming into the stores more effectively. And sales less traffic or sales over traffic has always been an important leading-edge metric to me because what it does is it equalizes for any product differences across the stores and talks about store execution and see that consistently across the portfolio. It's quite encouraging.","As to the differences across outlet versus other types of real estate, I'll be very honest with you. We continue to disaggregate the data. I'm very big about the averages hiding the truth and look at different types of real estate, look at first quartile versus fourth quartile, and we really -- I really can't say and paint a very convincing picture for you that there is a -- there are big differences other than as you get into the C type malls, I think, we and other people pretty consistently see the fact that traffic is tougher there. That all said, those are the types of malls where we have continued to reduce our exposure over time, and we will continue to do that on a going forward basis.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura.","Simeon Siegel","Art, what's your view on the right long-term margin just given your points on the advantages of gaining share and the benefits from scale? And then, Teri, if I can, to follow up, I think it was Lorraine's question. Just to clarify, with the fire impacting last year's comp and margins, is there any shift in 3Q trends that we should keep in mind just versus what's been happening in the first half?","Arthur Peck","Yes. And let me give you a specific non-specific answer to the first question, which is I'm -- I like margin dollars because, at the end of the day, margin dollars is what we put in the bank. So we're very focused in a relatively new way with analytically based functions on understanding elasticity and therefore, where our products points drive share maximization and most importantly, margin dollar maximization. And that's a metric that starts on the first 20 feet of the store with understanding what margin dollar output is per square foot on a table, and it goes all the way up to thinking about our stores and our brands at the end of the day. So this is work in process. But rather than focus on a rate, I would say that we really truly do understand and are thinking about everyday elasticity and yield management and about maximizing margin dollars to the system. Obviously, we've demonstrated our ability to open up some rate expansion, which we're pleased with, but we also don't want to get greedy at the end of the day. We want to make sure that we are focused on market share and margin dollar maximization.","Teri List-Stoll","So on the Q3 specifics, I'll give you a little bit of perspective that you will come to yourself as you do your modeling. If you think about it, on the gross margin line, in the -- in last year with the Fishkill and other things, our gross margin for Q3 '16 was up pretty substantially from Q3 '15. And so if you compare the magnitude of expansion you might see in Q3 versus what we've experienced in Q2 and Q1, it's probably not going to be as great. But we don't have anything that we would say in particular that would change the fundamentals of what we're doing on the business. We're still continuing to be focusing on AUR on these higher loyalty categories that drive higher margins. On the SG&A line, as I said, you're going to get a little bit more increase in Q3 versus what we've seen in Q1 and Q2, same fundamental drivers, just a higher magnitude as we've reallocated some of that advertising expense into the back-to-school season and also to see some of the engagement we want as we head into the holiday season.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark Altschwager","I wanted to follow up on inventory. You talked about more basics versus fashion or seasonal basics in the inventory mix. Maybe just talk about the decision to shift the balance of the assortment. Wondering if that's concentrated in one particular brand or across-the-board. And maybe contrast that trend with the opportunity you mentioned on buying bigger into some of the big ideas with more confidence in depth. And then just also on inventory, with the investments in the loyalty category, just curious how that's impacting your AUR outlook for the back half.","Arthur Peck","Yes. That was a complicated question. So I'll do my best to first remember it and then try to answer it. Yes, if you think about the comments on basics, so again, the traditional way of buying a season, you're buying preseason and you're going to be buying it against your traffic trend. And with traffic overall tending to be negative, although, again, we've seen some positives in our business, you're going to be buying your units very tight, particularly in Banana as an example. We had pivoted more of that open to buy, which is a finite pool of open to buy. It is supporting some of the fashion. Some of that fashion's been working, and some hasn't. So it's less about really adjusting the architecture of the assortment than about rebalancing the buy inside of it and taking some pressure off of those fashion categories and frankly, putting some basics inventory in to just get our service levels back up.","It's an important part of the business. And we have places where we were running service levels that were unacceptably low, and we felt like if we took a little bit of pressure off of some of the fashion in particular that wasn't working and put the inventory back in responsibly to support the basics business, that would be good. The second thing to think about is where our responsive pipeline really kicks in is in supporting trend and fashion, and so that gives us the ability to invest later and put pressure into those categories if we see an opportunity. On the AUR -- or AUC, AUR, et cetera, I would say we're going to continue to look for opportunities from both mix. So I referenced the sculpt denim that we have across. That's our highest price point denim with the exception of selvedge in our business. And as we see that product and customer response to it, we're going to put investment behind it. That's going to pull our AUR up. The other driver of AUR is to continue to manage our yields through less promotional depth and less promotional breadth on an ongoing basis. And appropriately, we've been pleased that some of the notes that had been written have actually noticed the fact that we have been backing off of some of the promotional intensity versus a year or 2 years ago. And that is correct. That's been very intentional, and that will also be a contributor to AUR expansion as well.","Teri List-Stoll","I guess, I would just add, this is -- I mentioned this, but I know there's a lot to deconstruct in inventory and I'm sure the increase strikes you. And we, like you, are very cognizant of the need to remain very disciplined in our inventory levels. And so we are very thoughtful and very controlled at how we execute that growth. But just keep in mind, in addition to the in-transit timing piece, there is an FX piece, which is probably close to 1 point, I think, of negative impact. So when you net those 2 pieces out, you get down to a bit of a build, which is explained by the things we talked about but isn't so far ahead of our comp sales that when we look at the liable percentages being improved that we feel uncomfortable with where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","I was curious if you guys can talk a little more about Old Navy, maybe the second half expectations from a bigger picture perspective. But are there changes that you're making regarding marketing spend at Old Navy in addition to Gap brand? And maybe talk about either categories or processes that you think are the best opportunities as you look at the back half of last year.","Arthur Peck","Yes. Just let me throw a few things at you. We're always tuning our commercial plan and our marketing mix. And a simple example of that would be as we've seen back-to-school become less of a defined moment in time and more of an event that starts somewhere in later July and can oftentimes go through September week 1 or week 2, we've managed and tuned the marketing mix to also put some media in place to support the later back-to-school this year. So as an example, on the East Coast, a lot of the schools aren't starting until after Labor Day versus schools in the South -- in the Southeast that have started 1 week or 2 ago. So we're bouncing that regionally to support that. For the most part, the back half otherwise is, based on our learnings, tuned and tweaked but not necessarily any fundamental changes in terms of what we're doing.","The only other thing I would just talk about is that we saw particular success and continue to, even recently, with key price point item promotions in Old Navy. We did a $3 dollar polo for back-to-school couple of weeks ago, and it was a blowout event. And so customers do respond to that. We find it's a very effective way to generate traffic and then build a basket around that. And we're, of course, looking at anything that works in saying how do we mix it up and how do we build some of that into our commercial plan in the back half. Largely with Old Navy, it has stayed the course with what's working and continue to support with inventory investment in the categories that are driving the business, which goes back to those that I mentioned at the end of the day. Kids and baby business is continuing to pull the train, and bottoms and denim business is continuing to pull. And we mentioned many times that we have an active business that we think has significant runway in front of us in that business as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","We were curious about your prioritization of different digital initiatives in the back half. What would you say are the more versus more significant factors? And any comments on what you want to do with mobile and what kind of opportunities you have? And also, as you have such stellar brands, would you look to partner with Amazon? Like, how would you think about a framework for considering that as an option?","Arthur Peck","On digital, it's -- digital and running a great digital e-commerce business and mobile business is about many things. And the wonderful thing about it is that because it's clean, you can put things into work, whether it's product recommendations, whether it's site speed, et cetera, A\/B test, A\/B placement test, A\/B test video, et cetera, et cetera, and be very rapid and innovate very rapidly. And so it's hard for me to really look at it and say it's any particular thing at the end of the day because there's a whole bunch of things in work right now. I mentioned some of the customer facing capabilities, which have continued to be important for us. But the bulk of it is really about making sure that you've got an easy shopping experience that the customer can click through cleanly, where it's easy to check out, et cetera. If I go to mobile, everybody on mobile needs to continue to figure out how to effectively monetize that traffic, and that's what we continue to work on. ","Getting to a native app experience on our apps has been a big step forward. It's faster. It's easier. It's cleaner. It's more intuitive for our consumer. But there's going to continue to be work as to how do we build big baskets around our mobile shoppers, and we believe that it will continue to be a place where our customers go to at the end of the day. So we're excited about both. We're seeing traffic grow. We're seeing our e-mail acquisitions grow. We're seeing our SMS list grow, et cetera, to be able to feed that business, and then it's about really delivering a low-friction, high-touch experience in the digital world.","Oliver Chen","On Amazon, could you just speak to your thoughts there about a potential partnership? Or what distinguishes you most in terms of being -- having unique core competencies? I think you talked a lot about that in the beginning of your remarks as well.","Arthur Peck","Yes. And that really starts with brands at the end of the day, and we feel like very strongly that expressing our brands and controlling that expression of the brand and delivering an experience around that, whether it's an experience in e-commerce or mobile or experience in our stores, is really important. I've been open in saying that we will always be where our customer is, and so we are not close minded in making sure that because, first and foremost, we are a fashion apparel company, and people come to us to buy clothing. As to something on Amazon, I just really don't want to comment right now. I've commented where we have had effective third-party relationships like Tmall, which has been a wonderful relationship for us in China. We've done business with Zalando. At the moment, we're staying the course, and we're focused on delivering an exceptional brand experience, whether it's digital, in our stores or the combination of the 2.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward Yruma","I know you guys have made significant investments in responsive and in speed. I guess, can you link at all the gross margin performance in the quarter or maybe kind of how we think about gross margin longer term with some of these initiatives and maybe how they're helping to drive gross margin?","Arthur Peck","Yes. So there's a bunch of things that are packed in the gross margin, and what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to assign a coefficient to each of them. I mentioned product acceptance. Start there. We believe that we are largely on trend with appropriate fit and quality and pricing on our products, and that matters. Responsive certainly plays into the equation, and I cited the numbers from Athleta, which is one example but representative of the kinds of things we're seeing in a number of categories right now where Athleta has the great majority of its bottoms complex on responsive, less than 8 weeks, oftentimes faster than that and has been driving double-digit comps now in a 2-year stack. And that has been, in that case, largely enabled by both great product but also able to feed units into the business close to demand.","A third piece is I mentioned that we're focused on yield management, which is really continuing to be as selective as we can about the breadth and the depth of promotions. I'm not going to signal the fact that magically we're going to get back to a right price business. That's not the nature of this business. But there is a lot of money to be had through really being focused on yield management and continuing to back off of the promotional depth and breadth. And so it's a number of things that come together, also including being responsible on our inventories and not over broaden our inventories, which we are quite confident that we're not right now. So it's hard to break all of those out. We feel they all matter and they're all important, and we have to work all of them equally hard everyday.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Given your real estate outlook, Art, how do you envision the pace of store closings? Any change by division in terms of how you're seeing the base? And as you think about the online business and the profitability there, has it been improving? And with the initiatives in omnichannel, will that drive operating margins the same level or higher than physical? How do you think about it?","Arthur Peck","Thanks, Dana. And you are both consistent and persistent I would say. If I think about real estate, so let me just start with Gap. Gap's got the oldest fleet. We've had the greatest number of store closures in Gap, and yet almost by definition, Gap will continue to have the highest level of exposure into older centers. Some of those centers are fantastic, and some of those centers, at some point, are going to go away. So without giving you a store count because I don't want to do that right now but I will reassure you that we are working that everyday. We are, like I said, going to really aggressively and responsibly manage our exposure to real estate that is struggling, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll do that across all the brands, but it really starts with Gap and then Banana Republic.","We had very little of that inside of our portfolio at Old Navy. We have very little of that, to be clear, inside the value businesses of Gap and Banana Republic, whether they're in traditional outlets or in non-traditional value locations. And of course, Athleta's fleet is very fresh. So we'll continue to work it. I'm -- like I said, I'm big about the averages hiding the insight. And so we're always looking at the trailing edge of our fleet and the leading edge of our fleet and understanding what the differences are in performance and really trying to identify places where we just shouldn't be at the end of the day and frankly, identify places where maybe the consumer has moved on and we could reposition the store as well. And you know all those tools have been in our toolkit over the course of the many years that we've taken a lot of square footage out of the space -- or out of the fleets.","Jennifer Fall","All right.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host, Katrina O'Connell, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn K. Murphy","Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I hand the call over to Sabrina, who will take you through the key metrics in our third quarter, I just want to give you a couple of opening comments. This was our seventh quarter of positive comps, and we feel good about that. A very important part of what we've been talking about, mostly internally, is the momentum in our business, gaining market share, and that's been important for us. And this was a 2-year comp of 7. I think it was a good performance for Gap Inc. And the difference between good and great in this quarter was that in Q3 of 2012, we had a very strong quarter in colored denim at Old Navy and Gap. It's kind of the peak of color. It started in February 2012 and kind of peaked in August, September and October. I think the team did a very good job last year. And so it was a good quarter. But I expect great every single quarter, and I have to look at it now and go, in hindsight, could we have built a better assortment commercially that could have allowed us to gain share and growth in other categories besides denim that, when you put it all together, could have produced a performance of better than a plus 1? My answer to that is yes, and the merchant teams and design teams and marketing teams know that our expectations always are, when you're up against that kind of very strong performance in denim last year, then what are we doing strategically on our assortment and how are we building an assortment to be as commercially strong as possible to achieve better growth and better market share than the year before?","Now I've been here 25 quarters, and every quarter has its own unique circumstances. I've been here for 2 quarters, where we we're announcing an acquisition. Whether that was Athleta or Intermix. I've been here in some quarters where we talked about, we're going to go into a new country. An example of that was when we announced that we're going into China for the first time. I've been here where we've talked about the fact that we had to make adjustments to the company's operating model in order to be successful. But in order to get a 14% increase in earnings per share, we did manage the SG&A line without doing, I want to make -- this is very important to me, without doing any long-term or midterm damage to the business, to our prospects, to our brands. This is the model we have. And when we can sense that maybe you see a little bit of a consumer slowdown or, in this case, a combination of the consumer not reacting the same way they did in the first half of the year and us not building the kind of assortment that I hope we could build, we were able to make the adjustments in our economic model to still produce the earnings we produced. And I think that speaks to the experience of the management team, the commitment of us at Gap Inc. to be successful and to win and produce results that we expect of ourselves, that we'll make those adjustments. But I do want to be clear on one point, this is very important to me, we will never make any reductions in an SG&A plan that damages the business short term, midterm or long term. We still had strong investments in the third quarter to deliver our growth plan, to introduce omni-channel, to get the company ready next year for responsive supply chain and just the beginning of what seamless inventory will be for us in 2015. Those don't get touched. That's all part of the company's long-term plan. So this was just one of those quarters.","Now looking forward, we're just in the beginning of this very important quarter. It's not only important because it's Q4 and involves a big holiday season. It's important because it's the last quarter of the year. And in order to maintain the momentum I talked about earlier on the comp side of the business, we like to finish every year strong, and this is what this fourth quarter is about. I think the teams have done a great job getting ready for this holiday season. We're as ready as we've ever been to compete in the marketplace and that's in Europe, in Japan, in China, in our franchise businesses, Athleta, Intermix, our 3 iconic brands. Now it's interesting, there's been a lot of conversation about late Thanksgiving and all the holiday shifts. Our view is there's always been this many holidays within the larger context of the quarter. You've got this run-up before Thanksgiving, which is -- again, this is true of the U.S. marketplace. You have the actual event of Black Friday and the 2 days that follow it. You have these 2 or 3 weeks after Thanksgiving. Then you have the week of Christmas, and then what's become really important is the week after Christmas. So we, more than any year, have really planned and said, \"Well, look, there's really 5 holidays inside the holiday.\"","Let me just leave you with this one thought. Every year, all companies come into the holiday season with a pretty good list of what we're going to do differently to make sure that our business is better than the year before. That's a long list, and none of us have enough time to go through it chapter and verse today, but I just want to mention a couple of them to you. One is on Tuesday this week, we launched Reserve in Store, which we were piloting in Chicago and San Francisco, into every single one of our Banana Republic stores and close to half of the Gap brand fleet. Secondly, we've made gift cards a much bigger part of our business, and there's been some great work done by all of our teams to make that really a driver of success for us from now till the end of the year. And lastly, we are very coordinated between our online and store business. The reason behind that is the structural change we announced last year of them looking at the brand across all channels, you'll notice they're much more coordinated. And I think that's going to be good for us to make sure that we can come together with the marketing power and the promotional and event power behind those 2 channels to win the season.","Thank you for your time, and let me now pass over to Sabrina.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Thank you, Glenn. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased that we continued to meet our goals of growing sales and increasing earnings per share in the third quarter. Our earnings per share were $0.72 versus $0.63 last year. This represents an increase of 14% on top of last year's 66% growth. Here are some additional highlights for the quarter:","Net sales were up 3%, with comparable sales up 1% on last year's 6% comp increase. We leveraged operating expenses by 230 basis points. Operating margin expanded by 100 basis points to 14.5%, and we distributed nearly $900 million of cash in the quarter, including the repurchase of 20 million shares at an average price of $38.77.","Turning to sales performance. Third quarter total sales were $3.98 billion. For the quarter, the translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported sales by $61 million, primarily due to the weakening of the yen. On a constant currency basis, our revenues were up 5%. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Now turning to Slide 6. Gross margins declined 120 basis points to 40%. Merchandise margins were down 140 basis points, driven by our promotional activity in the quarter. This was partially offset by rent and occupancy leverage of 20 basis points. And gross profit for the quarter was about flat to last year at $1.59 billion. Regarding inventory, we're pleased that we finished Q3 with inventory dollars per store up 4%, in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter.","Moving to expenses. We managed our expenses in a disciplined manner and leveraged operating expenses by 230 basis points. Total operating expenses declined by $60 million versus last year to about $1 billion. Marketing expenses were down $16 million to last year at $162 million, primarily due to lower spending at Gap and Old Navy. Delivering on our goals of sales growth and expense leverage resulted in net earnings of $337 million, up 9.4% to last year.","Moving on to cash distribution. True to our commitment to distribute excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased 20 million shares in the quarter. Our ending share count was 449 million. Year-to-date, we've distributed over $1.1 billion, and we're pleased to have announced today a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization.","Year-to-date capital expenditures were $487 million, focused on our growth in China, Old Navy Japan, global outlets and Athleta. We ended the quarter with 3,160 company-operated stores. Square footage was up about 1% versus the third quarter of 2012. Store count and square footage by division are listed in our press release.","And now I'd like to share our outlook for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance of $2.57 to $2.65. The range encompasses a reasonable set of outcomes for a holiday season that we anticipate will remain promotional. As a reminder, at its midpoint, this guidance implies a growth rate of 12% for the full year on top of last year's 49% increase, and this is even after absorbing the impacts of both foreign exchange and the loss of the 53rd week.","The following full year guidance metrics remain unchanged. Operating margin, about 13%; square footage, up about 1%. Regarding company-operated stores, net of repositions, we plan to open about 160 and close about 80. Store openings are weighted toward Asia, while store closures are weighted towards Gap North America. We expect capital expenditures to be about $675 million and depreciation and amortization to be about $475 million.","Full year effective tax rate guidance remains at about 39%. For the fourth quarter specifically, there are a few important call outs. First, it's important to note that Chinese New Year shifts from February 10 last year to January 31 this year. This shift in timing will likely increase our in-transit inventory at the end of the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect our inventories at the end of the quarter to be somewhat higher than the Q3 increase, though certainly still in the single digits.","Second, regarding foreign exchange. Keep in mind that our year-to-date sales have been negatively impacted by $162 million, or an average of $54 million per quarter. We expect this translation impact to continue into the fourth quarter. Naturally, this currency depreciation also negatively impacts our earnings in addition to our sales.","And finally, the 53rd week. As we've noted since the end of the first quarter, just as the first quarter benefited from the calendar shift, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by more than the $0.08 that benefited Q1. This is because the volume of sales for holiday is larger than the volume during spring. As a result of having one less week and the calendar shift, it is unlikely that we will leverage expenses in the fourth quarter, especially rent and occupancy. Additionally, driven by the loss of the 53rd week, we expect the spread between comp and total sales in the fourth quarter to be negative. Having explained the unique considerations around the fourth quarter, let me close by saying that we're pleased with our solid year-to-date performance. We've achieved top line growth of 6%, with comps up 3%, and we've delivered year-to-date earnings per share growth of 29% on top of last year's 43%.","As we look forward, we're focused on delivering solid performance in the fourth quarter across our brands while pursuing our long-term strategies.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Katrina.","Katrina O'Connell","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question will come from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It seemed like you pulled back a little bit on marketing in 3Q, and I know that you were doing television or were going to. How do we think about marketing expense in the fourth quarter? And I guess, how much flexibility do you have based on kind of how the holiday shapes up?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Sure. Most of the marketing was just as planned, Ed. I mean, you're right. In the third quarter, once we decided not to do television in the fourth quarter, the production costs that would have gotten into the third quarter didn't occur. But for the most part, that reduction was as planned. What I'll tell you to be helpful, we expect marketing spend overall for the full year to be probably flat-ish, so implies it might pick up a little bit in the fourth quarter. But overall, no dramatic change. And as a reminder, because marketing is so important, we are holding sort of flat-ish, as I said, on a full year, on top of 2012, very large investment in marketing of over $100 million.","Operator","From Citi, we'll go to Oliver Chen.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Our question is about the assortment and the opportunity for betterment there. Could you just clarify where you may see the most opportunities in? The merchandise margin in the marketplace has been tough on everyone given the promotional nature. Are we to expect a continuation of the down merchandise margin? If you could comment on how you see that proceeding, that'd be great.","Glenn K. Murphy","Let me take the first part of that. What I was trying to say on the assortment in my opening comments was a little bit that there's uniqueness to every quarter. And one of the unique attributes about Q3 for us was it was anniversary-ing some very strong positive performance by us on denim in -- especially in August and September, and the denim was really driven by the color trend that was going on in 2012. So the criticism of myself and of our teams is that we knew that trend was coming. I think we tried to match indigo with treatments on indigo denim up against the colored denim trend when in hindsight, every now and then, you're going to get a trend, especially in a category that's as strong as denim for Old Navy and for Gap, where trying to match that dollar for dollar in our assortment, it's just not possible. I think I've told people before on the phone that over 12 months, indigo denim with any kind of treatments and whatever the trend is on indigo will beat, over 12 months, will beat a color trend. But any given month or any given quarter, when the trend is that strong on color, it's tough to really match that. And in hindsight -- and this is what we get paid to do and I get paid to do, is to make sure that the assortment opportunities outside of dominant categories like that, we make the right investments, put in the right product, market them accordingly so we can gain share across our total business and maybe take a slight pass for one given quarter on such a big category as denim.","Sabrina L. Simmons","And then with regard to the merch margins, we don't guide specifically to that. But to be helpful, as I said in my remarks, we are assuming a continuation of the promotional environment. And then with regard to growth margin, combine that with the fact that it's unlikely that we're going to leverage rent and occupancy due to that lack of the sales in the 53rd week.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And, Sabrina, just as a follow-up, when we think about next year and inventory as a major theme, how should we think about the model -- the modeling in terms of all the opportunities you guys have with untrapping and other more efficient inventory management?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. I mean, we'll have more to say about that when we get into next year. And really, most of that starts to take hold not until the back half of next year and into 2015. But more commentary on that next year, Oliver.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Y. Chen - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Glenn or Sabrina, certainly, I think we all know that it's been very promotional out there. How do you think it's impacted each of the brand differently, if any? And do you feel like, given the learnings we've seen so far, that they have sort of the right tactics going to holiday? Related to that, I was wondering if you can comment on sort of the Gap Cash event and sort of any early learnings you can share with us regarding that?","Glenn K. Murphy","Here's what I'll say about it, I'll say that the promotional environment that -- and I'm sure that there's been a lot of commentary on over the last week as people ahead of us have had their calls and spoken to investors and shareholders. But my view is there's a little bit of fatigue out there when it comes to consumers. So the question is, are we disappointed in the consumer sentiment? Or as we, I'm just being honest, as an industry, have we really not been that innovative in order to give the consumers a value proposition that doesn't look like wallpaper day in day out? Now we've tried to break out of that, and I think we've done a good job at Gap Inc. I think we can do a better job going forward. But if the definition of winning is having a similar promotion on a similar category week in, week out, I think people are going to do that. I think they're going to struggle going forward to the point where the consumer is looking for an event, they're looking for something exciting. At the end of the day, we're in the fashion business. Maybe in my past life, just purely playing a discount or price card might have been effective, but not in this business. So when I think about the fourth quarter -- and again, I think our team every single year since promotions became a little more prominent in the industry, have worked hard to become a little more innovative. And you mentioned, Betty, Gap Cash. Well, there's Gap Cash. Banana Republic are doing the 8 Days of Giving. We've got L'Wren Scott coming out in a couple of weeks, our big launch partnership with Banana Republic. We've got Overnight Millionaire for Old Navy. That's going to start at 7:00 on Thursday. So a little bit of public service announcement here. 7 p.m., Thanksgiving Day, $1 million. So Overnight Millionaire. We have Reserve in Store, which we launched on Tuesday. So we're really working hard, one, and this business is all about product and it's about service. And -- but we're really trying to make sure that we don't become predictable. That's really an acronym you do not want to have stuck on your brand. We are trying to be a little more provocative, find different ways to express value, and I think the team has done a good job. But my belief is they've done a really much better job in the fourth quarter. And it is, at the end of the day, the job of the marketers to speak to customers in a way that doesn't cause them fatigue.","Betty Y. Chen - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Glenn, related to that, can you share with us what your thoughts are so far regarding the Gap Cash event in the...","Glenn K. Murphy","Yes, it's a little early, but it doesn't actually get -- there's the earn period, which takes about 30 days, that we give customers a break, and then there's a redemption period. And the redemption is not starting officially until the day after Cyber Monday. So not that we'd ever comment on it, but I've been pleased with how Super C-A-S-H as a tool has worked for Old Navy. This is a different spin because Old Navy and Gap are different brands, but at least we've learnt how to actually do that the first time around. Made some mistakes with Super C-A-S-H when it first was introduced a couple of years ago, but that's true of any program. That's been incorporated in Gap Cash, and I think their first time out will be of high expectations. But we won't know much for another 4 weeks. And again, we'll never give specifics but I'm hoping it'll be, as I just finished saying, something that's different and something that's provocative and not predictable that can help Gap brand gain market share.","Sabrina L. Simmons","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","From Janney Capital Markets, we'll hear from Adrienne Tennant.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My question is again on the highly promotional nature. Obviously, Target this morning had talked about this new test in the California market, I guess, for this Black Friday, 40% off all apparel and accessories. And it kind of sort of begged the question, as an industry leader -- can you hear me?","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes.","Adrienne Tennant - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","How can you sort of change the nature of the competitive deflationary pressure, generate that customer loyalty back to the brands that is not solely tied to price?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I think I gave a little bit of that earlier when Betty had her question. Look, another part of this, Adrienne, is that one of the advantages we have is that we're not a one-dimensional business. So in the malls, we have to compete for that business, hopefully using some of the tactics I said earlier, to be able to speak to customers in a much more provocative way and not be -- not all relying on a discount -- I don't know about this test, but just being a 40% off on an easel on the outside of your door, I mean, anybody could do that. But we're in malls, we have outlet stores, we have a very strong online business, we're in strip centers with Old Navy, we have an international business. So when it's all said and done, we said this about 5 or 6 years ago, that one of the reasons we entered into the strategy we did on multiple brands through multiple geographies into multiple channels, we didn't want all our eggs in one basket. So is there deflation in the apparel business? Well, if you look at NPD, they'd say no. But is it a business that has heavy inflation? The answer is also no. And we are trying, and the best you can do, when it's all said and done, is have amazing brands. So if you own a store, you -- like the company you mentioned earlier, they own a store. But if you own brands and you put marketing behind them and you create excitement about the brand and ultimately, in our business, you create some passion about what that brand stands for, then that's what's supposed to sustain you, and we're working towards over a period of time where there may be some deflation.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Glenn, you talked about not cutting anything that would damage the long term or short term for the brand on SG&A. What did you cut? And are some of those buckets available to offset the deleverage from the lower sales in the fourth quarter?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, Lorraine, I think you know us well enough, and I may have said in my opening comments that one thing Sabrina [ph] and I did when we started working together about 6 years ago was we committed to ourselves we'd run -- we would put together a new economic model, we'd build an economic model that had flexibility to it. And as I said earlier, every quarter has its own unique circumstances or nuances, and Sabrina and I have really trusted our brand presidents and their structure. We give them a chance to actually be successful in the quarter, put their plan in place and stick to the plan and execute it. But like anything in business, if you can't adjust to that, then you're going to have a failed quarter or a failed success in a full year performance. What we've been doing with them is we give them a chance to really deliver on their plan. And when we see that the plan may not be delivered, like in Q3, to the level we expected, we have a flexible model. We can make adjustments. And I should say that last week, the clock started again. And we now have a plan that we agreed on with them many, many months ago, and they're working their way through that plan right now that has the right balance of sales, gross margin dollars and leveraging expenses to produce the earnings we expect. But at the end of the day, let's look -- let's take this from a glass half full. At the end of the day, the sales -- let's assume the sales were better than we expected, assumption. Therefore, the margin is better than we expected, like it was for 7 quarters before this recent quarter. Then we can let them continue their plan or, even in some cases, maybe make some deeper investments to maintain the momentum. These are choices we have as a business. And what we like about it is we're not stuck, and we can make that all the way through the end of Thanksgiving, into Cyber Monday, then run to Christmas, then run after Christmas. So I think the brand presidents understand that. We trust them, that they're making the right decisions. But if we see a business that looks a little weaker than we expected, then we know how to make the adjustments.","Sabrina L. Simmons","And I would say, Lorraine, the only thing I'd add is for the fourth quarter, you could certainly count on us to continue to be disciplined. But as I mentioned in my remarks, given the sales from that extra week fall-off, it's unlikely we leverage, especially in rent and occupancy. But with regard to expenses, if we do get some leverage, it's likely to be very modest.","Operator","From BMO Capital, we'll hear from John Morris.","John D. Morris - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Glenn, on -- I know you talked about the TV marketing already. I'm curious about the timing of the decision. It's relatively new, right, to pull back on the fourth quarter marketing? And I'm just wondering your thoughts behind that, why, and your thoughts about that as it relates maybe into next year as well.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, John, it really wasn't a pullback. I think that we -- if I did say this in the last quarter, what the intent behind it was that if the third quarter television investment for Gap was outstanding on a number of different metrics, we had the ability, because we have television buy we can always exercise or let go and open up to the market, then Stephen Sunnucks and the team at Gap Global would have chosen to come out this holiday and put the money in place. And I actually thought that television was quite good. We received a lot of positive comments, especially strong on social media. But as we looked at it, we just felt that we had a good plan in place. We had a better media mix. And the need for television, well, a consideration wasn't necessary. But if we look at next year, what I can tell you is that all of our businesses are constantly looking at their media mix. I can't think of a single company you guys are talking to who isn't doing the exact same thing. So what that means with Old Navy is Old Navy is a strong television advertiser, but they're seriously looking going forward about the -- at their media mix. Gap is not a regular user, from a medium perspective, of television, but it's an option for them. I think I've said before, even if Banana Republic had such a great idea, and TV was part of the mix that can make that idea come true and give voice to it and drive traffic and market share in gross margin dollars, we're not against it. It's not part of the repertoire today, but we're not against it. So when it's all said and done, I think that you can count on Old Navy to have the broadest of media mixes. Gap has flexibility to always consider an additional medium, which is television, and we play it sort of -- we have a plan, strategic plan, full year. We look at the media mix and then we make choices as we come into a quarter.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Glenn, so you're expanding Reserve in Store but only to half of the Gaps. I was just wondering if you could provide some of your thoughts on how you think about the opportunity for Reserve in Store between Gap and Banana Republic. And then you earlier talked about gaining market share through innovative ways and methods. I was wondering, how do you think about Reserve in Store as one of those innovative methods as you look to the holiday season?","Glenn K. Murphy","It's a little soon to tell on the second part of your question. I know I've said before that to me, this is -- it could, executed properly, I think it could be a bit of a game changer for us. And we're going to get a really good read. The whole premise behind Reserve in Store was let's test it before the holiday, and let's learn. Because if there ever was a time, the notion of 12:00 at night, somebody's on their tablet or their desktop or their smartphone, going on to the Gap or Banana Republic site, seen something they love, reserving it, getting a confirmation first thing in the morning and then coming in -- because again, it's a reservation. It's not pickup, reservation is, we believe, most appropriate for our business -- and then come in and hopefully our team can expand on their selection by adding different items and products to it, and then completing the purchase. So people are time-starved this time of year. It's a unique service. It's only been broadly available in 650 stores since Tuesday morning. So it's a little early to tell. But I really believe that if we can get a good read, execute it flawlessly and get the marketing that tells customers a story I just told you, which is -- we're open 24 hours. And don't think we're not. You can actually -- it's amazing how many people are actually placing orders after 10 p.m. and before 8 a.m. And that's really the message this time of year. Place the order, we'll reserve it for you. It's sitting there, we'll tell you when we have it. So I think it could be a great foundational component of unique messaging in our category for those 2 brands, maybe even for Old Navy one day, definitely for Athleta, as we look at unique marketing ideas to try to drive our business, as I've said to Betty earlier, that are not dependent on promotional activity that we think is inappropriate when you have brands like we have. Why 200 stores? The Gap team looked at it. They've got great regional coverage. The Banana Republic team were the first to actually test it. They were the ones who were further along, so they were more comfortable going almost chain-wide. I wouldn't be surprised if the Old Navy -- sorry, if the Gap team didn't add more stores in the New Year.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask Glenn, you talked about the fact that you, not to the detriment of your long-term investments when you pulled back on some OpEx this quarter, you still were able to invest in a number of things, including dynamic supply chain. I was just curious, can you give us some specifics on what your investments -- what areas you were investing in and what we should expect from dynamic supply chain for next year?","Glenn K. Murphy","Sure, Lindsay. I think what we were trying to communicate, there's certain investments and certain strategic plans the company has that are, regardless of any given kind of signs of ourselves or consumer weakness, we're just going to continue to stick with them because they're part of the company's long-range plan. So in that bucket, you'd have investments like in China, Old Navy International, Athleta growth, some recent growth with Intermix, global outlet, I mean, there's a list of investments we continue to make. To your point, we went forward, whenever it was, sometime earlier this year and said, besides our growth initiatives, we have seamless inventory. So that's just getting going now but will not be delayed because of one single quarter, and we are just getting ramped up now to make the investments in 2014 to get the benefit of a seamless inventory operating model in 2015, omni-channel that Matt just asked about. It would have been easy for Sabrina and I to cancel, delay Reserve in Store, but we'd never do that because that comes with an investment. It's a very important part. And of all the omni-channel plays we have, and I just met with the omni-channel team the other day, roadmap is in place, really excited about some of the ideas they have for 2014. And the last one is what we call responsive supply chain. And again, those don't come with a lot of investments. That's more of a process change than investments. So from that perspective, we are continuing to push ahead. We've made some good progress. It's never enough for me. I would really like to see us go faster on that front. But the team is moving at a pace they're comparable with. As Sabrina said earlier, maybe a little teeny bit of benefit in the early part of 2014. But the majority of a responsive supply chain model we're going to operate will more be in the back half of 2014. But certainly, you never hear from us or our presidents any reason to delay the company's top 4 strategic initiatives.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But how specifically should we expect the supply chain to be more responsive in the back half then because of these investments?","Glenn K. Murphy","I'd say it's multifaceted, we talked about. So first and foremost, it started with fabric. So we've done fabric consolidations. That for the most part is done, we are now completing fabric platforming. And then we have, without giving too much details, probably other people want to call in, we have 3 other components which we've put out publicly, VMI, test and respond and rapid response, and those are all ways for the supply chain we have today and the decisions and assortment strategy be made much later in the process. So when I was talking earlier about the assortment strategy, missed opportunity as far as I'm concerned when it came to denim in August and September of this year, if we had, had in place an operating model that is based on what I just said, we could have made adjustments to the assortment strategy in early to mid-spring to correct if we -- as we looked at our assortments, you know what, we probably need to maybe adjust it slightly. We could have made those with a responsive supply chain. So there's a long, long list, Lindsay, of all the benefits we're going to get, but #1 is getting closer to the market, secondly is dealing directly with mills as opposed to vendors by having private platforming, and being able to make decisions later in the process and keeping your powder dry. And we are all set up to get some initial benefit from that in the back half of 2014. It's not a onetime win. It's something that just continues to evolve and we continue to get better at.","Operator","And next we'll go to Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","A couple of questions about China. Could you talk about the year-to-date results of Gap in China? How are the stores comping? How many do you have at the end of third quarter? And how many of the 160 new stores will be Gap in China versus Old Navy?","Glenn K. Murphy","I think -- did you say 160?","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","You said 160 new stores and 80 closures.","Glenn K. Murphy","Oh, sorry.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So the 160 would be more International, and the closures would be more Gap.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well [indiscernible] get to that. Here's what I can say about China. I was just there 2 weeks ago. Again, we feel very good, we're going to end this year with 82 stores, which will be, give or take, 10 outlet stores, and the remaining being Gap specialty stores. I was walking -- our first Old Navy, which is going to open on March 1 in Shanghai, that was under construction with the team. We'll be telling you in February how many Old Navys we're going to open in 2014. But what you're looking at now is the expansion of the strategy from 4 specialty stores initially and an online site, to now I'm saying ending the year at 82. Outlet now becomes part of the picture, and here comes Old Navy. We were really excited recently with what is the -- I'm sure it hit all the newswires here, what if the Black Friday of China, which is 11\/11, a big team-all event, and we've been online in China now for over 3 years, and that was just another example to us that the mix in that country of physical stores to online business is going to be much different than it is in the U.S. when the dust settles, say, 5 years from now. So that's why we were so passionate on getting our online site open and making big investments, as we were saying earlier to Lindsay, making investments behind our online site in China, because we do believe the proportionality is going to be different in China and we need to be ready for that. But we feel good about it. The team is great. They're excited, they're making good decisions. We're looking forward to -- we'll announce in February how many stores we're going to have, Gap specialty, but that's going to continue. How many more outlets? That's going to continue, and then give you an update on online and, most importantly, an update on the launch of Old Navy.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. And so within the opening number, Barbara, there's -- 35 of those openings are for Gap China. There's no Old Navy China this year. That's going to happen in 2014, and we'll give you that number. But there's 15 to 20 Old Navy Japan in the opening store counts as well.","Operator","From Wells Fargo, we'll go to Paul Lejuez.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just looking at the fourth quarter, just wondering how you think about the comp drivers for each brand now that it seems like we're probably looking at lower AURs. Just wondering how confident you feel, Glenn, that you could hit 8 quarters in a row.","Sabrina L. Simmons","Yes. I'll just start followed by giving a little bit of color on Q3. So given that gross margin ticked down, clearly, our average unit retails were down. And our traffic, largely driven by that stronger dip in September, especially at the end of September, because traffic improved in October, but traffic was also negative for the quarter. So the 2 levers that supported our positive comp were conversion and unit per transaction. Because we're assuming the promotional environment continues into Q4, I would say that we'd love to see traffic stronger. Of course, we'll be working on that, and we'd love to do -- well, we will be doing everything we can to improve our AUR. But again, with the assumption that the promotional environment continues, I would say the 2 drivers will continue to be conversion and UPT.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And is that across all brands, Sabrina, or can you maybe separate each one?","Sabrina L. Simmons","I would say, in general, yes. In general, yes. I mean, there's obviously going to be some differences. But in general, for the 3 big brands, obviously, Athleta is in an entirely different camp given its size, and it's a very different brand. But the 3 other brands, I'd say generally yes.","Glenn K. Murphy","And part of this, too, Paul, would be when the quarter is done, is what percent of our business did we actually do on Black Friday, and what percent of our business did we do from December 26 to, let's say, January 10? And it's our -- we know we're going to do big business on Black Friday and Black Friday weekend. We know there's big business to be had on post-Christmas. But based on the sort of general theme that's been going on, can our product and branding and marketing messages that are less focused on discount, can they resonate enough to drive the traffic we need in the conversion side of the business, which lessens the dependency on those more discounted times of the quarter. And that's -- we're -- as I'm sure people have figured out maybe a long time ago, maybe people spoke a lot less strategically about retail in general and maybe fashion apparel, but anybody else you're talking to in the last couple of years, you really got to be thoughtful and strategic when it comes to your gross margin management and traffic management. Here we are the weekend before Thanksgiving, that's a very important time to think through this first weekend. Then you have a run from Monday to Wednesday. It's a season within a season. Thursday now is its own day, Friday is its own day. Saturday and Sunday is a unique pairing. Then you have this run of 2 or 3 weeks before the weekend before Christmas. It's its own unique time of year. Then you have December 26. So say that we don't spend I would probably say maybe too much time overthinking and doing our analysis and talking to customers and trying to figure out trends is what we're spending more time than -- 5 years ago, we never spent this kind of time trying to really figure out day by day and weekend by weekend. And if we figure it out right and make the right decisions, then I think Sabrina is right. Then we'll probably have a quarter that has less pressure on AUR. But that's to be determined still. We've got to -- we're in that first weekend of the run I just talked about. So -- but if we planned it right and thought through it properly, hopefully, it'll produce the results -- as Sabrina said it's -- results, as Sabrina said, we're working towards, which is getting improvement in our AUR, and that's what everybody here is trying to accomplish.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess as we try to parse through the prior 6 quarters to this, there's been questions of how much the color bottom cycle in particular has been such a big driver, I guess especially at the Gap division. So just wondering if you guys have any comments you could share from an internal perspective of how sticky you think your market share gains might be going forward? And are we going to expect to see ongoing 30% to 40% off the entire store into next year, if need be, to protect those market share wins?","Glenn K. Murphy","Brian, what I was saying a few calls ago was that I thought we did actually a really good job in the first 8 months of the year when we were up against the anniversary-ing of the trend you just referenced. And I know I've said before that, that trend kind of peaked in September, of October of LY. So we've been through this assortment opportunity multiple times. I just think that's the miss we probably had. As for market share, given the fact that we had the performance we had from February till August, especially in those categories, I think we didn't only hold our market share, we built it. And there have been some people recently that put out their numbers who are pretty dominant in the denim business. So I would say that we've continued to gain share based on the performances we've seen. And our own internal numbers and the external numbers we stare at would indicate that, that while the anniversary has been a challenge, we've not only held our share but gained on top of what we were able to achieve in 2012.","Operator","And moving on, from Topeka Capital Markets, we'll hear from Dorothy Lakner.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just switching gears a minute, just wanted to go back to Athleta. You have opened lots of stores this year, kind of getting up towards that 100-store mark, hopefully sometime next year, and you've also made some adjustments to the assortments there. So I'm just wondering if you could share with us anything you're learning as you've moved some of the assortment towards more, I guess what I'd call, street wear, in addition to the great performance wear that you're offering. How are you thinking about Athleta as you continue to grow the store base?","Glenn K. Murphy","Good for you, Dorothy. That's actually a really good observation. My challenge with this all the time is not to swing it too quickly. But yes, there -- I would say that part of what you've observed, which is absolutely correct, was driven as we opened our first stores in New York and realizing that maybe the Northern California aesthetic Of Athleta was a little too much for New Yorkers and some other urban markets we're into. The challenge for us is not to give up on that. We bought the business, we love Athleta, and part of that is that it has a unique aesthetic. It is what it is. It's in Northern California, and we can't just eradicate that. But finding a better balance is what you're observing right now. I'd say that's really worked out well for us. And I think the team, led by Art Peck and Nancy Green, have done a great job of opening up, let's say, the brand aperture a little bit and get people who maybe the previous aesthetic, which is not for everybody, were willing to accept it and maybe our mix and match that with a wardrobe, but just buying exclusively that aesthetic -- or wasn't something that was attractive to as large a customer base as we'd like. When you expand as many stores as we do also, the observation we had to make is if we want to have -- you referenced 100 stores. If we want to have a business at that level or greater, we're going to have to get a bigger tent for customers. So that's been happening now for about 3 months. I think the marketing has now followed with it, so has the website. There's more changes coming. Nothing dramatic, just to keep broadening the brand's appeal, as you referenced. How do I feel about it? I feel great. I really think the team has done a great -- a really strong -- they've done a really strong job of presenting the brand in a different way without moving too quickly. And so far, the customer response has been very positive.","Operator","From Sterne Agee, we'll hear from Ike Boruchow.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, Glenn, just a high-level question for you on sourcing. When we start to think about 2014 input cost, can you talk about wage inflation in areas like Malaysia and how that could potentially spread to other countries in Asia? And just any high-level thought you have there would be great.","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, it's a little early to tell about one of the larger components of our costing, which is the raw materials. So far, cotton and oil are behaving decently well, so I think -- we feel good about that and the team that's working upstream. So part of it is -- are the raw materials going to be in a place that allow us to hold our current costing or even better it? Too soon to tell, but I like the direction it has been in the last 3 months. As I was answering a question earlier, some of the changes in our supply chain strategies that have been initiated the last 6 months, which is working directly with mills and less with vendors and consolidating fabrics and fabric platforming, that should also give us an opportunity to leverage that change with the vendor community. And you're absolutely right on labor cost. Some increases in Cambodia, in Vietnam, in Indonesia. You referenced Malaysia. We don't do a lot in Malaysia. Bangladesh. So that's a smaller component of our total cost, but it's a component. And that's been going on, and we're making the adjustments. And whether that's by taking more capacity of factories or having fewer vendors, we're doing everything we can to manage around it. But the big win for us is the change in our supply chain. I think that's going to bring some benefits to us. The team is working on that, and that's something we can't control. And we know how to manage one way or the other is if commodity costs behave. And so far, so good.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Glenn, a question for you. As CEO, that is say professionally, what would you ask Santa for this year?","Glenn K. Murphy","Well, I don't -- I'm a very tough person to buy for. I will tell you that on a number of different fronts. But if we could -- if on a personal note, if everybody in the office here can have a very happy holiday and get a chance to relax after all the hard work they've done, I'd feel good about that. And of course, we always want to make sure that -- and I've always had faith in the consumer. I'm just a glass half-full person. I just believe the consumer is more tailwinds than there are headwinds. And I think they're going to come out and buy. And if we execute properly, then I would consider that to be a very positive Christmas.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I was really thinking professionally as a kind thought for your workers and co-workers, and I share that. So happy holidays.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host, Jack Calandra, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Jack Calandra","Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.'s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.","For information factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations or descriptions of measures we are required to reconcile to GAAP financial measures, please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com.","These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 21st, 2015, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining us on the call today are CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Sabrina Simmons. Sabrina will be using slides to supplement her remarks which you can view by going to the Investor Relations section at gapinc.com.","With that I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Art Peck","Thanks, Jack, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to be here speaking to now in my second earnings call as CEO. The most important thing I want to do today is reemphasize our earnings guidance for the year.","You have I'm sure our press release in front of you. You have the details underneath that and after I'm done, I'll hand it over to Sabrina Simmons who will take you through the specific details and obviously, we'll have Q&A at the end of this call.","We'll talk about our first quarter results and I'll go a little bit deeper into what's been going on over the last three months. There are three issues that really impacted the first quarter. Two of those are macro factors which we've spoken to you about before in terms of foreign exchange and the West Coast port situation.","Sabrina will spend a little bit more time on that. I really want to dive in on the underlying results of our three global brands and specifically, the performance of our women's businesses.","As we've said and we continue to see, we've had an exceptionally well performing women's business at Old Navy which has driven great profitable growth. Product acceptance at Gap in the women's business has been tough and we're focused on making it happen. At Banana Republic, it's a work-in-process and we have work to do there as well.","Let me start first by spending a few minutes on Old Navy. Obviously, it's a very good story. A story that we're very pleased with it and a story that we have confidence and that's going to continue to repeat itself on a going forward basis.","Three years of excellent performance and most importantly, underneath the covers, growth that is being driven in a very high quality way with a very nice margin story underneath it.","Q1 comp was a women's story and I'm saying that in particular because as we have struggled with our women's business in Gap, as an example, Old Navy is an excellent example where we continue to get women's right season after season and we're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing with on-brand, on-trend product in our stores.","I need to point out that this is a combination of factors. It is clearly a team working well together, led by Stefan that is delivering this performance. But it's also underlying process changes that we have made in the way that we're running the business and the way that we're bringing product to market that is delivering the consistency that we're seeing.","I mentioned this before, but I need to mention it again, which is we're taking these changes and in some cases, largely transplanting them into our other businesses and that they are proven inside of Old Navy and they have been delivering this kind of performance.","Again, we have a strong women's business there, but it's been followed by a pretty strong business inside the rest of the box as well across men's, kids, and baby. And it's a thing of beauty when Old Navy is firing on all cylinders and has now for several seasons running.","On the flipside, I continue to be disappointed, but not surprised by Gap's performance. We have had a women's business challenge now for several seasons running, I believe we have diagnosed it correctly having to do with being off-brand, in some cases off-trend, and I can promise you that the team is all over it.","In the last call that we had I mentioned the hiring of Wendy Goldman. Wendy has hit the ground running. She is a highly collaborative, skilled leader working with the team and I've been really pleased so far the results the whole team is producing as they are focused on holiday and obviously on spring.","Jeff really has three priorities right now and I want to underline and emphasize those to you. We are in season every day and we're managing the business as aggressively as we can to get every penny out of the business.","In relative terms, kids and baby is performing better, and men's is performing better, but to be clear, I am not happy and Jeff is not happy with the entire performance of the brand and we're committed to turning it around.","On top of managing in season, we're obviously working extremely hard to make every improvement that we can to the outlying seasons including holiday and most importantly, spring.","On top of that, I said I was impatient. We're working very hard to change the product processes all of what we're doing at Old Navy in order to get Gap to a more consistent on-trend, on-brand footing. And I have to say much of the work that the team has done there to realign the team on the aesthetic of the brand is very, very encouraging.","Banana Republic is a mix bag. This was Marissa's first collection showing up later in the quarter. It's had a couple of very positive impacts in terms of reestablishing some fashion credibility for the brand and the relevance of the brand, but we didn't get it a 100% right and this is not to be excused, but perhaps expected as you're bringing a new designer and a new leadership team together.","The color palette was pretty start between black and white, not enough color in print and pattern for the season that we're in and we're still working to buy an assortment that is both commercial and fashion-oriented.","Relatively speaking, the men's business is stronger and it's not that the women's business is weak, but we have not hit the stride nor delivered the commercial results while at the same time, we have established some fashion credibility and that's our job and we're focused on making it happen.","In a moment, I'll turn it over to Sabrina. What I wanted to do is offer a few comments in advance about how Sabrina and I are working together and the commitment that we very much share together.","Obviously, a big part of our story over the last several years has been the fact that we're committed to a responsible capital structure and as this company continues to generate a significant amount of cash, we're committed to distributing that excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. It's important for me to emphasize that Sabrina and I are highly aligned on continuing that going forward while at the same time, responsibly reinvesting in the business.","Sabrina, let me pass it to you.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon everyone. As anticipated, our first quarter results were impacted by foreign exchange headwinds and delayed receipts due to the West Coast port issues. Despite these dynamics, we're pleased that Old Navy delivered another strong quarter on top of three years of growth.","As Art mentioned, we're focused on taking the steps necessary to drive improvements and greater consistency in our other brands while continuing to make progress on our long-term objectives.","Operating income for the first quarter was $386 million versus $443 million last year. Net earnings were $239 million. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.56, down about 3% versus $0.58 last year. It's important to note that our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. We estimate that foreign exchange reduced our reported earnings per share growth rate by about three percentage points.","Sales for the first quarter were also impacted by foreign exchange and the port issues. As reported, first quarter sales were $3.7 billion, down 3% versus last year. The translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $90 million in the first quarter.","On a constant currency basis, net sales were down about 1%. Regarding the port impact there is no meaningful change to our first half estimate of $0.13. As reminder, first quarter sales were impacted by having fewer units available for sale.","We expect that second quarter will be impacted by late units that well likely be sold at lower margins. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.","Moving to gross margin, first quarter gross margin was down 100 basis points to 37.8%. Merchandise margins were about flat driven by strong performance at Old Navy, offset by the impact of foreign exchange as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand.","Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points. In the face of challenging sales performance, we managed SG&A tightly. First quarter total operating expenses were $996 million, down $27 million from the prior year driven by foreign exchange favorability.","Marketing expenses were down about $7 million versus last year to $136 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses were 27.2% and deleveraged about 10 basis points versus last year.","As a reminder, in Q2, we will lap last year's gain on sale of nearly $40 million. Therefore, we expect greater deleverage in Q2 versus Q1.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars per store were up about 4% at the end of the first quarter. As anticipated, delayed receipts due to the West Coast port situation resulted in higher in-transit inventory levels at the end of the first quarter.","We expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store at the end of the second quarter to be up slightly versus last year as we focus on selling through these late receipts while trying to maximize margin. As a reminder, last year\u2019s inventory per store was up only 2% in Q2 versus up 7% at the end of Q1.","For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $61 million. Underscoring our commitment to distribute excess cash to shareholders, we distributed more than five times our free cash flow or $329 million this quarter. This includes $230 million to repurchase 5.6 million shares resulting in a quarter end share count of 419 million. ","Regarding capital expenditures and store count, first quarter capital expenditures were $150 million. We opened 29 company-operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,309 stores. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release.","And now I would like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations at the time we provided our full year guidance in February. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of 2.75 to 2.80. For the full year all other guidance metrics remains substantially unchanged. ","In closing, as we entered the second quarter we will continue to focus on levers that we can control, while we work to deliver compelling product assortments across all of our brands. ","Thank you. And now I will turn it back over to Jack.","Jack Calandra","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to questions. We would appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our firs question from Randy Konik with Jefferies. Again, Mr. Konik your line is open. Please check your mute button at this time. Due to no response we will be moving on -- ","Randy Konik","Hello?","Operator","Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Hello.","Operator","Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Sorry about that. I had little phone issues here.","Art Peck","Hi, Randy.","Randy Konik","Hey guys. How are you?","Sabrina Simmons","Good.","Randy Konik","I guess, just -- Art first on the -- I guess we will just -- let\u2019s dive right into it, right on the Gap. You kind of talked a little bit about the relative better performance around kid and baby and men\u2019s. So relative to the traffic of what you are seeing at, I guess, Banana and the Mall, is it more -- is it truly a traffic issue, conversion issue. Is the mom going in there for the baby, but just saying that these clothes -- I can't buy this? And just trying to a perspective on what is truly the problem there?","And then as it relates to your perspective on the women\u2019s side, is it -- it sounds like a combination of consistent fit, lack of color, bad marketing or not the best marketing, what have you. Just want to your get perspective on which are these things are most important to improve, which can be turned the fastest et cetera? Thanks.","Art Peck","Yeah. I mean, Randy, it\u2019s a same thing. I think we've been and I have been pretty consistent in talking about, which is, we know we have a problems in the women\u2019s business. We've diagnosed it. We've diagnosed it because you can go in there and look at it. I spend time in stores. I talk to customers, I watch what customers buy. We look at our product acceptance. And the issues are clear and have been clear for several seasons.","And it is a combination of all the above, which is we've got -- we are off trend and in some cases, way off the brand. We have some quality and fit issues, where we made some choices. And the issue is the one women\u2019s business which is why I'm focused on women\u2019s business, when the women\u2019s business isn\u2019t working it does in a brand like Gap, which is obviously dual gender and then whole family have a negative halo on the rest of the box.","But we are actually getting very good customer feedback on our kids and baby business. Men\u2019s business continues to be relatively strong. And so it\u2019s why -- when I have been working with Jeff and the team, it\u2019s been prioritize the women\u2019s business, because as it halos negatively when it\u2019s not working it has the same halo effect positively when it is working.","And I'm actually -- I'm pretty encouraged by what I see going forward. I can even look at the holiday assortment which is largely landed now and some of the, sort of, obvious mistakes that we've made, we have -- they are gone from the line. We've actually taken the step of cancelling some styles that we had and we knew were just not saleable, which is an appropriate thing to do as well, and which we've been able to do.","So from that standpoint, again, same thing I was saying before, team heads down working on the women\u2019s assortment and getting it back on track as much as we can do in holiday, acknowledging it was mostly bought and then spring being a no excuses moment. ","Randy Konik","Thanks guys.","Art Peck","Okay.","Operator","We go next to John Morris with BMO Capital Markets.","John Morris","Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Art, maybe if you could give us a little bit about your philosophy on handling marketing, the marketing spend going forward. I mean, I\u2019m sure we will hear from Sabrina as well in terms of the thoughts about the numbers. But I want to get little bit on the philosophy we saw you guys pulled back a little bit in the quarter and what can we expect and where are you thinking about allocating it by brand and your philosophy around that. Thanks.","Art Peck","I mean, the simplest philosophical statement that's easiest to make is that when you are not proud of our product you are not going to out there putting a lot of marketing behind the business and it\u2019s exactly the strategy that I followed back in 2011 when we looked forward down the pipeline, didn\u2019t feel good about the product and consequently pulled back on a lot of the working media spend that we had in place, and we are doing some of that now as well.","The other side of that is, I am feeling like we are really getting our returns in the marketing spend that we have at Old Navy. And well I can see returns and it can help drive the business, I am happy to put money into the business as well. So it\u2019s really about placing smart bets, not just sticking with the marketing plan or anything like that. ","So expect us to be tight and as product gets better, expect us to then start putting a little bit of pressure on the business. But you correctly have seen that we've pulled back and we will continue to do that until we feel like there is an opportunity to really tell the story.","And then the second issue is, and this is a topic broadly separate from the current performance of the business, that both Sabrina and I are very focused on right now. We have, over a long period of time, generally spent more than many of the competitors out there in terms of marketing and I think we should be getting more out of our marketing dollar than we are at the end of the day. Sabrina, do you want to add anything to that?","Sabrina Simmons","Yeah, I was going to add to be helpful which underscores what Art said is, in the quarter, as you might imagine, with Old Navy positive comping, they are not down at all in marketing dollars, in fact they are up. And the improvement comes a little bit from everywhere else where we are not as happy. And it also includes, by the way, I should say, Piperlime, because we closed that in the quarter and so we are not marketing behind that.","And then with regard to the second quarter, I would just say, there is not going to be any radical change, because it\u2019s likely to follow the same pattern as Q1. So I would look at something sort of starting -- last year as a good starting point to the second quarter.","John Morris","Okay, thanks. Good luck.","Art Peck","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. I had a broader question about how you are feeling about supply chain and test, read and react inventory - manage inventories and how this will work in terms of your strategic planning.","And then I do think we are observing some newness on the trend front on the marketplace, from our perspective. I'm just wondering what vehicles might be best for you to try to capitalize upon that newness factor that seems to be happening in some bottoms and tops.","Art Peck","So the story on supply chain is, as we've been telling it that we\u2019re continuing to push on it on a number of the elements, on platform fabric which enables us to get back into season very quickly on some of the test and respond that we've been doing.","Old Navy is farthest ahead in realizing this with the changes that have taken place, obviously and the challenges in the business at Gap, changes in leadership, challenges in the business. Those two businesses lag. Banana is probably in the middle and Gap is farthest behind.","What I can say quite confidently is that as we have implemented it it\u2019s very clear that it\u2019s having a positive impact and it\u2019s the right thing to do. And then the question really is scaling it and continuing to scale it as fast as we can.","And so -- and we are using this in some cases to do exactly what you talked about with respect to a trend out there that we see or something like that. We will put a set of silhouettes in bottoms and we'll see which sells and allows us to go -- cut more aggressively and respond more quickly into the silhouettes that are selling right now.","And obviously in denim, as an example, there is lot of variation out there in terms of rise, in terms of leg silhouette, and the novelty and we can be more responsive there. Knits is an easy one where we've also used that and particularly inside of Old Navy to be more responsive to where the knits business has really shown some real strength and puts some volume behind it.","So, it\u2019s a clear capability. As I've said pretty publicly, we are in the business that we guess a lot and anything that we can do to minimize the guesses and guess better, and inform it with data, has a real positive impact on the business.","Oliver Chen","Okay, Art. And just your -- just for expectations, it's more about spring versus holiday, but you've made some tweaks for holiday. Just I wanted to understand, I mean, how we should think about the catalyst and timing?","Art Peck","So in Gap brands, specifically, you mean?","Oliver Chen","Yes.","Art Peck","Yeah. I mean, kind of, going to stick to my same story there, which is that, I don\u2019t want to make any promises about holiday because as the team got in place holiday had a pretty good team behind it and so much of it was developed. What I can say is that the team did not do anything and they\u2019ve put their shoulder against it and made some changes there. ","I'm certainly hoping it will be better and from what I have seen, I have seen some encouraging elements of the assortment that I think are in a much better place. But I'm really putting my big expectation on spring.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Art Peck","Sure.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Hey, good afternoon guys. So expense control remains pretty impressive over this year and next couple actually. What type of flexibility do you think remains on a go forward basis, and particularly if a top-line turn where not to materialize at the end of this year or even in the spring. And then just what kind of room do you have to continue to cut some expenses?","Sabrina Simmons","Yeah, well this part of our expense phase is related to our stores and that varies in large part that -- half of that varies with sales. So we do have the benefit that if sales do not -- are not realized to the extent we\u2019d like them to be, we have a natural variable component that comes down. So that's one piece that will always be in the work.","With regard to sort of how we deliver the expense savings this quarter to help you think about how we would do it in future quarters. A chunk of it came from foreign exchange, so we call that out. And so we benefited, probably between the translation and balance sheet re-measurement about $30 million of benefit.","Even after that the expenses were pretty close to last year. So very tight. And that comes primarily from this variable component I talked about, as well as we brought that marketing down a little bit by $7 million. And so we would continue to use those levers that are variable or discretionary like marketing. ","Q2, I just want to call out, again, it\u2019s a very different dynamic, because we've leveraged last year on Q2 by 190 basis points. So just, I'm sure, optic perspective that includes the gain on sale of $40 million last year. So we are going to be lapping that. And then we layer on really kicking in June the wage increase.","So the deleverage we would expect to be higher in Q2, just because of what we are anniversarying such high leverage, but we will behind the scenes continue to work all the levers we have at our disposal to manage our expenses very tightly, especially if we are not realizing the sales we would expect.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just quick follow-up, online posted the first year-over-year contraction that I can remember maybe ever. Can you just talk about initiatives in place to stabilize this channel as well?","Sabrina Simmons","Yeah, online number really was driven and impacted by the ports as well. So number one is sort of at a high level, it\u2019s important to remember that they too were impacted by that. The second piece is the Piperlime closure. So, again, we wound down and actually finished closing Piperlime in the first quarter. So that's going to be another chunk of it. And then you just have the effect of Gap product acceptance being fairly weak. ","So you put those three together, and you come up with, we are not happy with the number at all, but we would expect it to improve ones for out of the port situation, certainly and get that to a more normalized level.","Matthew Boss","Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt McClintock from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt McClintock","Yeah. Good afternoon everybody. Art, I was wondering if we could focus on Old Navy for a bit. Three consecutive years of solid comp store sales performance and it would appear that that performance should just be now gaining steam from some of our supply chain initiatives."," Can you talk about the evolution of Old Navy\u2019s comps of the performance there from the beginning. Three years ago we put up a solid 6% increase to the most recent result. And how should we think about this evolution as those supply chain improvements continue to accelerate your ability to deliver fresh fashion to that business. Thanks.","Art Peck","Yeah. I'm glad you are saying that. And you can probably read the article that was in the newspaper earlier this week as well. There is some information in there. I think and I hope what you saying and what you are believing is that you put that much consistency in place, three years, multiple quarters back to back and there is a reason behind that and there is a reason behind it.","And it is -- it starts with, obviously, Stefan and his team, which is a really good team, working together, but the much more important thing behind the scenes is that team living inside of a very disciplined process and as set of process change, it is allowing for the consistency. ","Again, I say this often publicly that it\u2019s relatively easy to have a great quarter. What is superlatively hard in this industry is to put quarter after quarter together and then year after year. And so we have a lot of confidence there in the processes and capabilities that we've built. ","It starts with what we think is a really great process right at the beginning which filters trend, really systemically across a wide variety of sources, filters trend down to the right ones that we feel are brand right and appropriately commercial for Old Navy.","And it\u2019s allowed us to be in trends that are happening, at the same time in the designer and the premium contemporary space, it\u2019s allowed us to be into those trends in Old Navy almost in the simultaneous way which really is the way the world is working right now. So that ability to be right and to respond very quickly is powerful. ","And then if you just go down into the system, there is really -- I think a really disciplined and structured management of the assortment that we are running as well right now, which allows to maintain the proper amount of newness at Arena portfolio, but also have a super solid set of styles that are proven that we can invest in over several seasons to help us really drive the -- really drive the commercial plan of the business.","I guess, the way I think about it is, that a healthy business is a business that\u2019s gaining market share and Old Navy has now demonstrated its ability to hunt and win at market share pretty consistently for a number of quarters running.","So I won't say that this is going to be perfect every time, because it\u2019s tough in this industry with fashion. But I do have a great deal of confidence in the system and process that we've built there. And it\u2019s obviously why we are working very aggressively with Jeff and his team and Andi and her team to almost do turnkey installation of some of these components into the other businesses as well.","And we will see the results on a going forward basis, but I have been really pleased with what we are seeing with Old Navy and really confident with what we see going forward.","Matt McClintock","Thanks a lot Art.","Art Peck","Yeah.","Operator","We'll go next to Susan Anderson with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Susan Anderson","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I was wanting to ask just about expectations for gross margin, kind of, as we go throughout the year. I assume in second quarter it should be worse because of the port situation. But then should we expect it to kind of impact positively in the back half or should we expect continued SG&A to kind of help to offset that to get to your EBIT margin guidance? Thanks.","Sabrina Simmons","That is a tough question, because we do not guide to gross margin season. But to try and be helpful, we do -- we have given a perspective on operating margin. The gross margin, what I will tell you just to keep in mind. And you are absolutely correct with your view that, there is going to be pressure that we expect in the second quarter because of the port for sure.","As a reminder, we are also dealing with this year headwinds within the gross margin line due to foreign exchange, so that's just part of what we laid out as the early part of the year for everyone to understand because we have that very large Japan and Canada business.","Then other than that I will tell you once we're passed the first half poor impact, of course, we'll be heads down on trying to deliver the healthiest margin we can. And we will ultimately continue to use all of our levers to try and put up the best value that we can every quarter. So, we'll see how that works out.","Susan Anderson","Got it, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. Art, you talked about some of the improvements in changes in processes at Old Navy that have been implemented there over the last couple of years, and that you felt like those processes -- and those improvements could be transported I think to Gap and Banana.","Could you just talk to us about what -- just help us understand exactly what those process improvements are if the transportation process from one division to the other has already started to happen or the knowledge sharing already started to happen. When do think we might see the early results of that in terms of the merchandise in-store? Thanks so much.","Art Peck","Yeah. I mean again, I reiterate -- and let me reiterate what I said in my comments. The three lanes of work that Jeff and his team are focused on right now specifically in Gap. Obviously, you have to run the business aggressively in season and we're doing that. The team is heads down on the business on a global basis.","The second issue is fixed as much of the product as we can that is in the pipeline and deliver spring -- spring women's product at a in a brand appropriate, trend appropriate way. And then the third is rebuilding the product processes.","So, there are a lot of plate spinning right now inside of Jeff's world, but he and I both feel very strongly that we can't wait. So, we're working these things simultaneously.","If you think about some of the key elements of the process, one is very simply the length of the pipeline and Old Navy has been running on a shorter pipeline for a while. And Gap is developing on that pipeline now as we speak.","And then there is the trend process, the assortment architecture, the supply chain capabilities, a number of other things as well which we're layering in. Quite honestly Jeff and I are sitting your saying how much can we throw at the organization? And how fast can we push? But we are pushing pretty hard and pretty fast.","Spring will come to market with a shorter pipeline. But it's going to be a hybrid really of the way they have traditionally brought it to market and the new process that we're building. Remember that more and more up to speed on the new platform as we go through product development for 2016 in the outlying seasons.","I can't tell you exactly when there's going to be a lights on moment of this revealing itself, because it was at Old Navy and it is in both at Banana and Gap more of a progressive rebuild, but some of the key elements are ready of lease right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Hi everyone. I wanted to ask about Old Navy and given the brand success whether you think there's opportunity to take a little bit of AUR and how you're thinking about AUR generally in light of the lower AUC environment for the back half? Thanks.","Art Peck","Yeah. I mean to me AUR is one of those things that if you have confidence, you can achieve it. It's a thing of beauty. And our issue with AUR as a company has been our inconsistency in our ability to achieve AUR.","Again inside of Stefan's business, there has been opportunity that they have had and they have demonstrated their ability to mostly out of mix, really not out of make at the end of the day.","I mean one of the things that's really cool about what's going on at Old Navy is that they are able in many cases to achieve cost reductions, an elevated sense of quality, and a mix up all at the same time from AUR. Now, it's in selective category.","So, this is one where Sabrina and I are absolutely in locks-up which is to put AUR and look for AUR on the basis of mix and track record because it's proved to be way too elusive at times, not just for us, but for other people in this industry.","And then the other side of AUR having nothing to do really with the make of the product or AUC is just getting off of the depth of the promotions that we've had in some parts of the company.","And frankly in my view that's probably a much bigger AUR opportunity in the near to medium term than any fundamental changes in product mix or product make. We've been very heavily discounted as you know and in some cases, overbought in areas where the product is not registering, and that's a tough spot to be.","So, a second part of Gap is to really make sure that we're buying holiday and spring in exactly the right way and again, I've said publicly that I have a pretty strong bias towards always modestly under buying a season and looking for upside in AUR versus trying to force a lot of units through the system.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up. Art when we met with you last, you had talked about -- thinking about some different ways you might conceptualize the store format and different things that you were thinking about. Have any of those experimental or new or evolved store formats come into clearer focus? Thank you.","Art Peck","We're still working on it on the inside. Old Navy has something that they will be testing, I'm not quite sure of the timing yet, but certainly within the course of this calendar year. And then I'm focused on our international expansion as well and in particular for both Old Navy and Gap.","The store size is a big opportunity for us in terms of opening up smaller, more productive real estate spaces where we otherwise wouldn't actually necessarily even be able to open a store. So, it's -- not ready to make a pronouncement on this one, but it hasn't lost any of its importance and it certainly is being backed across the company with a high degree of urgency.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We go next to Adrianne Neve with Janney Capital Markets.","Adrianne Neve","Good afternoon. Quick question on the inventory. I know that Old Navy has been in a position of Chase throughout fourth quarter and into the first quarter. You're able to cut some inventory at Gap going into late summer -- late spring summer. So, I'm wondering are you comfortable with your inventory levels now? And then really quickly if you could just talk about AUC opportunity in the back half? Thank you very much.","Sabrina Simmons","Sure. So, the inventory increase, Adrianne, is really mostly due to the in-transit issue related to the port. We told you guys we wanted to goal ourselves at the beginning of the year excluding the port something like slightly down to flattish and I would say we're pretty much there excluding this port issue that puts us up for.","And then you see that we trying get back with the guidance at Q2 of getting back to tighter inventories slightly up. And the reason we're giving ourselves a little bit of wiggle room is with those late inventories coming in, we don't want to do anything unnatural of goods aren\u2019t really liable to just force the sell-through to get to EOQ. But it's still fairly tight when you think about it to be slightly up when last year we're lapping only in EP2 [ph].","So, overall I would say we're comfortable with our inventory levels and will continue to manage them quite tightly. And your second question was --","Adrianne Neve","On AUC opportunity with cotton deflation?","Sabrina Simmons","Right. Yeah. So, that opportunity really begins the summer flows because we told you when we bought our spring flow cotton really wasn't down yet and so yes, we hope to capture -- I mean -- and we feel confident that in the second half, we should get some tailwind.","The magnitude of that we've also talked about isn't -- it's a low single-digit certainly because the simple math that we try to help you all with to be illustrative is that if cotton prices were down 20% when we placed of those orders, broadly you would expect -- with nothing else changing, you would expect AUC down about 2%. But, of course, there's always some mix and a little bit of reinvestment here and there. But that's sort of directionally what we're trying to capture in the back half.","Adrianne Neve","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We will take our last question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Art could you share your updated thoughts on square footage and points of distribution for both the Gap and Banana brands?","Art Peck","Yeah. I mean it's a pretty simple conversation I would say right now, which is that we are always looking at real estate opportunities, whether it's a store that we should be in, because the center has -- is no longer relevant, whether it's an opportunity to downsize or reposition and so that's part of the normal ongoing part of how we can downsize.","And that's really the work that the team is doing all the time. And it's obviously here in North America where we have the most mature business, but we're obviously doing that all around the world across all of our fleets.","So, not really ready to say anything more about it right now in any form other than it\u2019s part of how we would be running the business in a responsible way. Sabrina I don't know if you want to add anything more to that.","Sabrina Simmons","No, that's right. I mean reviews on the fleet are done on an ongoing basis and obviously we look even more deeply when brands are underperforming. Overall, historically Banana Republic has had very high returns and they have a pretty tight fleet size. So, work underway more to come, I would say, but yes, it's always on our radar and it's an ongoing initiative.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","A - Art Peck","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today.

I have a number of things on my mind today that I want to share with you, and really they are reflections about the first half of this year and certainly about Q2.","So, number one on my mind is a consumer environment and let me really tease it apart. There's obviously some strength out there in different parts of retail. In apparel specifically, the environment remains challenging, and quite frankly, it remains most challenging in the higher end of the market. And just to remind everybody, we have a very robust value portfolio with our outlet channels and the Old Navy business.","Number two, the restructuring work that we announced several months ago. I'm very pleased that we've been decisive and we've taken action, and as you know that includes some expense reduction and trimming some parts of the portfolio where we had businesses that we felt did not have the potential for long-term returns.","We're not all the way through this and we've taken action in Japan with the Old Navy fleet there, and as we mentioned are making progress on tuning in to BR international fleet as well.","The third thing on my mind is the product to operate model. And we've obviously been talking to you quite a bit about this over the last several calls that we've had. If you think about the work that we're doing, we've been very aggressively focused now for some time on the back end of our model on really building responsive supply chain capabilities and that's through all the things that we discussed; fabric platforming, more test and respond, shorter lead-times, and shorter calendar.","The front end of that model is demand-driven buying. And so, we're doing work in both of those right now. I want to be clear that this is about continuous improvement, continuously building and speeding up our capabilities. We have work to do still in the front end for demand-driven buying, and both of these things will continue to evolve and advance in parallel.","The last thing that's on my mind is Old Navy. We obviously diagnosed some of the issues that we had in the business in Q4. I think I said at the time that Old Navy would hit a bump in the road, but the bump was going to be less deep and less long.","I think the return to improved performance that we've seen at Old Navy is validation. It's validation that we can, once again, move the brand to a market share gaining position, validation of the operating model that has allowed us to respond quite quickly and improve the business quite quickly, validation in the fact that we have a solid team in place, and frankly validation of the value proposition that our consumer sees in Old Navy. But again, those four things have been on my mind and I wanted to share them with you.","Let me move to a brand-by-brand conversation for Q2, and I want to start with Banana Republic. Clearly, nowhere close to the performance that the brand is capable of, nor what we expect and want to hold it accountable for.","The team and I are relentlessly focused on continuing to make improvement in the business, and under the covers there are some proof points that the work that we're doing is the right work where we've restored quality, and the customers have responded to that. Where we bought deeper into key categories, customers have responded to that. But the results of that obviously are not significant enough to manifest themselves on the topline or the bottom-line. So, we have urgency and we have a lot more work to do.","Now, let me turn to the Gap specialty business, extremely aggressive work that we're doing there, where Gap is following Old Navy's lead on demand-driven buying. And also some pretty aggressive work on the restructuring as well to get the cost structure of that business in line.","The work is deep, and it centers around core processes in the business that is work underway. Again, many points of validation for the work, but nowhere close to the results that we need to see.","We have, and I'm encouraged by this, some very good product acceptance going on inside the Gap women's business as we have reestablished the aesthetic of the brand. We have a great kids and baby business, continues to be a franchise category, and again I'll talk about this a bit later. We have a fifth business which we believe is very well connected to the active lifestyle that we think has significant growth and upside potential.","So, when Gap gets it right and has quality on-trend, on-brand merchandise, we have the authority to price and deliver value in a way that I'm confident the brand has, but we haven't seen the brand be able to do for a while.","I want to turn to Old Navy, very pleased with the recovery of performance from Q4. We diagnosed it. The team has come together around the fix. But again, we started to see the business pull out in Q2 as we made the changes through the product pipeline and the assortment, and I would like to believe and I'm actually pretty confident that we will see Old Navy deliver a very solid back half this year.","The other thing that makes me very confident about it is the opportunity for growth in front of us, and we have opportunities to put Old Navy into markets that are underserved today. We have an opportunity for a small store format and the first one of those that will really test it will be coming online in the next several months. If you can deliver a holistic, fully assorted Old Navy brand experience in a box, 8,000 square feet, it opens up a significant opportunity for us with that brand globally.","Last, it just plays in the sweet spot of where the consumer is. The value sweet spot today, Old Navy is extraordinarily competitive for the price out the door and has incredible quality, which is a killer proposition for the consumer.","And then let me close with Athleta. There's a lot talked about with respect to the active space, the athleisure space. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity, not just for Athleta, but for the company. We are one of the few, if not the only, large apparel company that has a very material enterprise-wide active business, and obviously, a very large ready-to-wear portfolio.","So, first, excited about the growth prospects in Athleta and continue to be very pleased with its performance. Secondly, excited about the opportunity for active growth inside of Gap and Old Navy. It continues to be something that our customer responds to. She has made it part of the way she leads her life and now really the way her family leads their life, and so we have an excellent position in three brands in one of the highest growth segments of the apparel industry that shows continued and very good growth.","Third, excited about the prospect to begin or accelerate technical innovation from the active space into ready-to-wear. One of the things that I was really pleased about this last weekend was, as I looked across our three brands, in men's denim, we now have a compelling and amazing stretch offering in all three brands. That's a direct lift from the active space and we're not stopping at denim. There's applicability of that fabrication, plus other technical features in twill, in shorts.","And those are just the beginning here. We see significant opportunity for accelerating technical innovation in ready-to-wear, whether it's stain-repellent, stretch, moisture management, et cetera, and it's something that we're moving to both embrace in our businesses as well as organizationally put some muscle behind.","So, let me close with where I started. I'm very pleased with the decisiveness and the action on the restructuring work that we've taken on. I'm pleased with the direction and the validation that we're starting to see of our operating model work, again, both the back end of the supply chain and the demand-based buying work that we're doing. And I want to call out Old Navy for quickly returning to improved performance which, again, was absolutely positioned to do. We've seen that show up now in Q2.","This is a company that is incredibly well-positioned for long-term success. You've heard my strong conviction. We've made some very material changes to how we do business and come out the other side as a very strong retailer and very strong apparel company.","Thanks and Sabrina, over to you.","Sabrina Simmons","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. While we have more work to do to deliver the performance we expect of ourselves, it's important to acknowledge there were signs of improvement in the business in Q2.","For example, comp and adjusted earnings trends improved quarter-over-quarter, merchandise margins in the quarter were up versus last year with positive average unit retail, and Old Navy, our largest brand, began to see signs of stabilization with a six-point improvement in comp versus Q1.","Additionally, we maintained our operating discipline. Specifically, we managed inventories tightly, delivered strong free cash flow, and continued to manage expenses prudently.","With regard to second quarter performance, as anticipated, our reported results were negatively impacted by the costs associated with our previously announced restructuring plan. These costs totaled about $0.29 in earnings per share, of which about $0.07 related to a higher effective tax rate.","The non-tax related restructuring costs were about $150 million, with about $15 million hitting gross margin and about $135 million in SG&A. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.31. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.60.","It's important to note that foreign exchange negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.05, or about eight percentage points of EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Excluding restructuring costs in both periods and the impact from foreign exchange, our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year were up slightly.","Regarding other key metrics, sales totaled $3.85 billion, comp sales were down 2% and total sales were down 1%. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. Excluding restructuring cost for from periods, adjusted gross margin rate was about flat.","It's worth noting that our merchandise margins were up 20 basis points year-over-year, or up about 90 basis points excluding foreign exchange. Additionally, both marketing expenses and adjusted total operating expense dollars were about flat year-over-year.","Regarding taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 52.5%. The higher rate was driven by non-cash valuation allowances related to our restructuring. Our adjusted effective tax rate was over 10 points lower.","Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, total inventory was down about 3% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our previous guidance. We expect total inventory dollars at the end of the third quarter to be down low single-digits year-over-year.","Year-to-date free cash flow was an inflow of over $460 million and we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash. As a reminder, we currently intend to replay our $400 million term loan this year.","Regarding capital expenditures and store counts, year-to-date capital expenditures were $270 million. Square footage was down 1% compared with last year. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release.","With regard to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, on our first quarter earnings call, we stated that full year earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs of $1.92, fell within a reasonable range of outcomes assuming trends improved.","While we acknowledge that trends did improve, as we said on our sales call two weeks ago, performance was uneven throughout the quarter. Therefore we think it's prudent to provide a guidance range that incorporates the likelihood of inconsistent traffic.","Excluding restructuring costs we now expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92 and operating margin to be about 8.5%. Regarding tax rate, we expect the rate for the full year will be about 44% or about 40% excluding restructuring costs in line with our guidance last quarter. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.","Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack.","Jack Calandra","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We'll go to John Morris with BMO Capital Markets.","John Morris","Thanks. My congratulations to everybody on the great progress you're making. I think the question would be for Art? You mentioned a couple things that were interesting in your prepared remarks, and I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color around the Gap division? Particularly when you talked about very good product acceptance, where are you seeing that? And in what ways would you look to get that cost structure in line on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Arthur Peck","Yes, let me just -- I'll just skate on this, John, a little bit. And obviously if you have further questions we're happy to process them. We've seen good product acceptance in particular on our key fashion buys that we haven't bought deep enough. So, if you were in our stores in July, you would've seen some really beautiful, well-made, feminine, brand-right tops with eyelet and lace. They were in the stores and gone in a heartbeat. Very much on-trend, off the shoulder as well, some of those things.","We were over-assorted in some of our basics programs, which is why in summer clearance I called it just a sort of an array of color that was left, particularly in Knits where we were over-assorted.","And so it's about rebalancing the buys and having more confidence in some of the fashion places where we're now starting to see some of that validation. And we're also seeing, really, the authority of the brand.","I was in our flagship store in New York a few weeks ago and in San Francisco, here, yesterday. There is a suede program which is a flagship program which has prices from $200 to $450, and it sold down to the piece. And it shows where, when we get it right with the authority, the brand is from a pricing aperture standpoint as well. And again, I'd like a lot more depth behind those buys and so we're learning here to get that confidence.","On the cost structure, Gap has been our most complicated business in terms of geographies and channels and multiple locations. And so as we're rebuilding business processes, we're also further rationalizing some of the complexity and getting some more leverage out of the cost structure as well.","We've had essentially two headquarters locations between San Francisco and New York, and then different teams in different parts of the business and we're just looking for efficiency every place we can in the overall cost structure.","John Morris","Great. Thanks. Good luck for the fall.","Arthur Peck","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So, with traffic at the Gap brand and Banana I know materially down, exiting the quarter, have you seen any signs of improvement in August? And just your comfort with inventory, if traffic did not bounce back from what you saw in July?","Arthur Peck","Yes, I'd rather not talk about August right now because we'll talk about that when we get into sales. And especially with volatility, before we have the whole month in, depending on the day you look at it with traffic patterns right now, you can call any of a number of different directions.","And we're also seeing Gap back-to-school now really kicking in earnest across the country. And so, I think it's a month that's still got to fill itself out before we're really ready to say what it looks like.","With respect to inventories, we are and always have been for a while very, very responsible on inventories and being very careful about how we buy to the traffic trend. And so we were aggressive on our carryover in terms of summer clearance. We wanted to make sure that we moved as quickly as possible to get clean there. I'll let Sabrina jump in here as well, but I don't have acute concerns about our inventory levels right now.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. No, I agree. I think we're trying to strike the right balance of being tight and lean on inventory, but not cutting off the opportunity to positive comps mostly using better average unit retail. So, that's the balance we're trying to strike. And obviously our inventories are in line with our overall total sales right now, which is not a bad place to begin a new quarter.","Arthur Peck","And Matthew, I just had one more thing here. As we\u2019ve talked now again about building responsive supply capabilities, back to those fashion tops that we had in the women's assortments, we blew through them. We felt we had a selling opportunity as we went into August and September. And in working differently with our vendors, we actually executed several new styles in a 24-hour period, including approving samples.","Put the PO out and were able to book several hundred thousand units with just a multi-week, several weeks lead-time to have them back in stores, and so as we continue to scale those very responsive in-season fashion capabilities, it gives us the ability to feed the upside when we see it.","Matthew Boss","Great. Good luck.","Operator","We'll now hear from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good afternoon. Sabrina, could you talk a little bit about which of the brands saw the most dramatic change from the first quarter in terms of gross margin and what the drivers of that were?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. So, I'll start with Gap. We've been saying all year, Lorraine, that Gap has been managing their actual margin rate pretty well, that they've delivered their performance with pretty healthy comps. So, that continued throughout the quarter. I would say they weren't a big driver to the upside, but they certainly continued to deliver healthily.","On the flip side, I will tell you, again, not new news to you, but Banana Republic experienced the most margin pressure, and offsetting all of that, of course, was Old Navy, who we've talked about had quite a strong June. It led with very nice, healthy margins, and that really helped deliver the higher AUR that we mentioned on my remarks.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Sabrina, it sounds like the merch margin had a 70 bps drag from FX from your prepared remarks? I'm just curious, how does that drag look as we move into Q3 and Q4 on the merchant margin line? And then given the lean inventory position, do you think you could continue to see merch margin improvement in the back half, even in a negative comp environment?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. So, starting with the foreign exchange impact, we lock our rates in 12 to 18 months in advance of the year. So, a lot of that headwind we're feeling is really from a while back when we locked in the rates. The year-over-year rates, especially for Canadian dollar and for yen had declined significantly and that's the headwind we're feeling.","So, for the portion of our cost of sales that we have hedged, which is the majority, let's just call it round numbers 80%, we will continue to have that kind of headwind.","Now offsetting that opportunity is, for example, the yen has strengthened a lot, which is great. And so for the piece that's unhedged, you have opportunity and on translation you have opportunity. So, certainly translation is not as big of a headwind in terms of sales. So, that's part one of your question and then part two was -- sorry I didn't write down?","Ike Boruchow","I was basically saying, can you continue to see merch margin improvement like you did in Q2 if you get a negative comp back half? ","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. We haven't guided to merch margins or growth margins. Obviously, what we're striving for is that kind of improvement. A lot of it depends on where the traffic comes out. So, you've seen when we bring traffic into a low single-digit negative, we've done much, much better on both topline and delivering it in a healthy way.","And as tougher is that, if that traffic doesn't show up. So, again, I think a lot of it will turn out -- or will be dependent upon whether we can bring and sustain traffic levels that are not deeply negative, but are reasonable like in the low single-digit range.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon. Art, to your comments about the technical innovation ready-to-wear and I guess the growing Athleta business? Can you talk to your approach around R&D, maybe any thoughts on the cost associated there versus any potential AUR you may expect to recognize from improved product? And then just to the comment about inconsistency traffic, do you guys tend to see any meaningful deviations between e-com and brick-and-mortar when you see that inconsistency? Thanks.","Arthur Peck","Yes, let me talk about this technical thing and see if I can answer your question. It's a very -- it's a deep and large question, so I may not get you all the way to satisfaction. If I just use an example of beginning to build in stretch into men's woven fabrications. That is something that is really partly our vendors and partly a direct port from some of our fabric R&D work and fabric and technical knowledge that we have inside of Athleta.","And some of the work we're doing in our businesses as well, working with our vendors. And so I don't see it as -- I mean we are taking some organizational steps in order to concentrate our strength there and our knowledge in fabric R&D. I don't see this as driving any significant deviations from the standpoint of the cost of our products.","And one of the advantage we have is when we put our businesses together, we do have scale. We're buying very large quantities; we're working with our vendors as a large purchaser.","And so if I look at Old Navy as an example where we built a great deal of stretch into the men's denim complex, it was a modest impact on product cost, but not a huge impact on product cost.","And I'm really pleased that as we continue to feather it into the assortment, the incremental product cost has been overwhelmed by price realization. And so we've seen that he's actually willing to pay for it and willing to pay more for it.","So, to me, this is being careful, but so far, the validation that customers are willing to pay for technical innovation in ready-to-wear is very clear across all of our brands and across the entire family. On traffic, Sabrina unless you want to jump--","Sabrina Simmons","Yes, I would say web traffic is much more consistent than brick-and-mortar traffic. There's some volatility, but overall definitely more consistent.","Simeon Siegel","Yes. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. It seems like AUC maybe wasn't much of a help in the second quarter. If you can confirm whether or not that's true? And I'm curious if you do expect to see some AUC improvement in the back half of this year and even into next year?","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. I would say, Paul, that from a commodity perspective, average unit cost has some tailwind for all of 2016. Now, what we've been saying all along, it's no headline because our brands always make decisions around mix choices and investment choices and once you take that all into account, there's just not any significant change in average unit cost. And we're not talking yet about 2017, so more to come on that.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. And then just one follow-up? We can't really see into your hedging so much, so I'm just curious, if FX rates kind of stay where they are today, what are the P&L impacts for next year? You might be able to shed any light there?","Sabrina Simmons","We're partially hedged already for next year because, again, hedging 12 to 18 months in advance would have us partially hedged. So, for example, a lot of the first half would be done, but we'd have much more opportunity in the second half. And then we have quite a bit open. So, there should be, for the yen for example, there should certainly be some opportunity.","Paul Lejuez","Great. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question will come from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Art, I wanted to ask on Gap brand, now that you have of a lot of the pieces in place that you need for the turnaround what -- with comps still negative, what are some of the indicators you're looking at that give you confidence that it is working? And as we think about over the next two to three quarters, what signs we'll see to show continued progress and ultimately, when do you think we can get back to positive comps?","Arthur Peck","Yes, I mean I sort of worked through a chain in my mind and this is the conversation we've been having, which is first to get the product out back into the aesthetic of the brand and to restore the quality and the fit.","And we have very encouraging metrics on all three of those that we -- our customers see us as expressing the brand appropriately and that they are responding to quality that they understand, recognize and value.","And our fit consistency has continued to improve, but it's been a real focus on bottoms. And that's a big deal for us and when we're at our best, we really kill it on fit. And she really appreciates that. But we've done too much wandering around the landscape over the last couple of years, as we've tuned and tweaked fit and not had a consistent fit.","It also as you probably know, has an economic drag on the company, particularly in the online business because when you're inconsistent on fit, she quickly learns that she's going to order a two, a four, and a six knowing that four is her size, and obviously figuring out which one fits and then sending the other two back or returning them to a store. And that has a drag of cost and devalued merchandise associated with it as well. So, fit has been a big issue for me and we're seeing some progress and response there.","Next really is to bring the voice of the brand back, and start telling the story because we increased marketing a little bit. We really pivoted it towards traffic and digital, but we've not been telling the story about the product and about the quality of the fit, et cetera -- all the elements of the story to the extent that we need to. And so, as we look at the back half, that's something that's very much on my mind, as you can imagine.","I mean that's part of the story at Old Navy is that we've continued to put marketing against the business and we've seen the consumer respond to it, but we've been relatively quiet at both Banana and Gap.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes, and further to Art's point. I stated in my remarks that marketing was flat in the second quarter, but we're planning on investing in marketing in the third quarter. Still working out our plans for the fourth quarter, but we will be investing in marketing in the third quarter.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","So, what would you say -- Art, you talked about you're seeing some encouraging metrics that she is responding? Are you able to share any of those with us? And then maybe when do you think the brand is in a position to comp positively?","Arthur Peck","I came out pretty provocatively on this earlier in the year and it has taken longer with this consumer environment and frankly, rebuilding our trust with the customer. And so this is a period-over-period improvement and we're seeing those.","I don't want to go into a lot of specific metrics right now, but I am very confident we're doing the right work, and I'm very confident that we're seeing the customer respond to it. It just isn't happening as significantly and as fast as it needs to.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on the progress. I guess curious in hindsight, it seemed like July was the strongest month for a lot of companies? So, I was just curious, as you hindsight the quarter or look at maybe there was a calendar shift, but any reason why July was called out as weaker in traffic I think from you guys?","And the second question is it sounds like additional mall anchors are announcing store closings? Can you maybe talk about how you feel about your portfolio between your value channel versus what you see in the mall and how often and what we could hear about an additional store closings' viewpoints? Thank you very much.","Sabrina Simmons","Hey Brian, I'll start with those. So, with regard to July, the difference really between June and July was the traffic dropped off significantly again for Banana and for Gap. We actually held traffic pretty well in July for Old Navy and that's why they have the better results of the three brands.","Why it dropped off, we're still trying to work through that. That's part of the reason that we are investing in marketing in Q3 because we're really focused on trying to change that inconsistency in trajectory. So, that's the July feel.","With regard to the portfolio and the state of the fleet, we're, as you know, have been very proactive in trying to stay ahead and take action on optimizing the fleet with big announcements last year on the Gap fleet and then another announcement in Q1 of this year closing another 75 stores in addition to those 175.","So, we're always open to looking to opportunities to optimize the fleet, but also, I think Art mentioned in his remarks, to look for opportunities to grow the fleet where appropriate.","Now, any growth in our future will certainly be focused around much tighter, smaller boxes. That is something we're very sensitive and hyper-aware about, is we just think we need to get much more productive within smaller boxes in our future.","Arthur Peck","The other thing I'd say, as you mentioned closures right now. We certainly have our eye on -- if we're in a center and there is an anchor tenant that announces a closure, that's going to be something we're going to process and deal with.","So, some of these companies have come out and announced significant closures. We're waiting to know what the specifics are in order to figure out whether we need to do something there.","Brian Tunick","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll continue onto Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Good afternoon. Congrats on the progress at Old Navy. Art, can you talk a little bit about the -- more about the responsive supply chain? And then a part that comes with it, test and reorder? How much to hold back at the beginning of the season, how much can you chase into intra season? And then Sabrina really quickly, just helping us with the timing of the 200 basis points gross op margin opportunity that you announced last quarter? Thank you.","Arthur Peck","Yes, again, very long conversation, so let me try to be quick and maybe not fully satisfy you. But there's really two components to the responsive supply chain, the back end, which is vendor facing, the length of our calendar, our fabric being platform, strategic vendor relationships where they have capacity reserved and they can cut into us on release of a PO. I'm really pleased with the extent to which we've built that capacity out.","The reality right now is that we are constrained and fully utilizing the back end by our front end processes which is why I also threw in the work that we're doing on demand-based buying.","And that's really -- if you really want to think about what that is, it's disaggregating what was a four season grand reveal buy all at once, into a much more disaggregated de-averaged buying process. And so we're working through that one right now. It is the constraint of scaling this at the enterprise level, and Gap brand is doing the heavy lifting on the front end right now on behalf of other parts of the company.","And so we have a ways to go there and it's really step-by-step. We're a long way advanced from where we were a year ago and we have a lot of room in front of us to continue to hold more open, be more in season, et cetera.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes, and with regard to the operating margin opportunity, Adrienne, as a reminder, that opportunity was outlined as going with the restructuring announcement that will provide us with $275 million of annualized savings. So, the way you get the two points is really just take out that annualized cost, holding the other variables.","Now, we said that because the actions we are taking are happening throughout the year, and many of them at the end of the year like a lot of the store closures for Old Navy, Japan, that opportunity will mostly be viewed in 2017.","Adrienne Yih Tennant","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice progress with margin and inventory. Art, I was also intrigued by your comment about the accelerating technical innovation in ready-wear? Beyond stretch denim, what's the timeline for introducing some of these additional innovations into the assortment in a more significant way? And are there areas where you think that Gap Inc. brands will have some differentiated fabrications versus the competition?","And then finally, what would the strategy be to communicate these technical innovations to the consumer? I think marketing has traditionally been focused on style and a value message, not necessarily technical attributes, so curious how you might thinking about that? Thank you.","Arthur Peck","Mark, you really pushed the button -- you really pushed several of my hot buttons on this question. So, congratulations. Again, if you start with, where can we see start to see this roll out. We're really pushing stretch in men's, which we're finding the men's customer really responds to across multiple fabrications and multiple wearing occasions. So, if you're in Old Navy today, there's a stretch Oxford shirt in there that is super comfortable. It's really like this precision fit.","We're pushing stretch across, -- really in men's, our two key bottoms fabrications in terms of denim and twill and both shorts and long bottoms. And really testing where else we can go with it, because we believe that it's actually really revolutionizing in many respects. That's a big word, but how men dress and the comfort and fit that they have in both tops and bottoms. So, that's a step.","We have nanotechnology in pants in Banana that we have basically not marketed at all, which is highly stain-resistant. If you pour a cup of coffee on the pants, it beads up and runs off and we find that he has responded to that.","Right now, to be honest, we are more using pre-existing fiber and fabric innovation from our vendors. We're also reorganizing in order to be able to work with some of our key vendors and be more proactive about driving innovation, which then we believe can unlock potentially some proprietary benefits.","And I don't want to get into that right now. It's a much longer conversation and its early days, but we feel that our scale and our size, working as a $16 billion enterprise for the company, has the potential to not just benefit from pre-existing innovation, but drive innovation. And so that's exciting for us as well.","And it's across a number of different dimensions, whether it's as I said -- whether it's heat management, whether it's stain-resistance, whether it's stretch and comfort. Just to name a few right now that are out there.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks again and best of luck.","Arthur Peck","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now hear from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Art, I was wondering if you could comment on what the outlook is for the fashion -- basic fashion versus basic inventory to get in better balance at Gap? You talked about shortening some of the lead-times and betting bigger on some of the fashion? Maybe could give us a timeline on when that inventory content may balance out?","And I was also wondering about your denim positioning, it feels like we're going through a resurgence of denim right now and Gap has always been very well-known for their denim and I wondered if you were hopeful on that front?","And lastly, Sabrina, on the 8.5% operating margin guide, does that assume a big uptick in operating expenses? Not big, but a step up from where we were in the second quarter? I'd appreciate some help there. Thank you.","Arthur Peck","So, let me try to quickly hit the two. On rebalancing fashion versus basics, it's kind of an old term, but I'll go with it for a second. We needed to reestablish store authority in some of our key item programs because we had moved away from that. And so you saw that happen in spring and summer -- big [Indiscernible] knit programs, et cetera. We were over-assorted there and so we're learning season-over-season and we've made some changes even after we booked in order to tighten some of our programs up.","So, season-over-season, getting rebalanced for, again, key item programs but also making sure that we have depth in some of these fashion buys. That's something that is going to get better every season.","I was just again in stores yesterday, and I saw Gap show up again with the first fall and you'll see that again with more depth in fashion as we get into September. So, it's a season-over-season process, and one where we're actively learning and managing our buys as aggressively as we can.","On denim, I've obviously been tracking and reading all of the comments that have come out across the industry over the last several days and there's a bit of optimism about denim out there.","We're obviously extraordinarily well-positioned in the denim business across all our businesses. Banana has a great denim business now as well and it's front of store. I'm not ready to say -- I'm always hopeful about denim and it's been in a trough for a long time.","We're absolutely positioned to ride the rise of denim, but I don't want to get frothy about talking about the fact that denim is now on a massive upturn and everything else. I'm much more in the mode of under-promising and trying to over-deliver here. And I'm confident denim will come back because it has been in kind of a malaise.","We are well-positioned across all of the bottoms fabrications whether it's from an active fabrication, a Bi-Stretch, a pant for a woman, a twill fabrication or denim; we're well-positioned to play wherever the market goes.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes, and on the operating margin guidance, Janet, we don't guide specifically to expenses as you know. But to try to be helpful, what I'll just remind is that we will continue for certain to be very disciplined with regard to our expense management.","We delivered not only in Q2, but I think for the entire first half on an adjusted basis, flat expenses and that isn't easy to get to because we're on many years now of managing these expenses pretty much flat and it gets harder in the second half.","The other reminder I'll just point to is that I've mentioned a couple times that because we are focused on improving the traffic, we're making some investments in marketing in Q3.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Chen","Thank you and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. I was hoping to maybe shift the conversation a little bit to the international business for a moment? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in each of the major geographies, Canada, Japan, Europe, and especially China? And some of the progress, maybe by brand, if possible? Thanks.","Arthur Peck","Sabrina will jump in and I'll jump in behind her.","Sabrina Simmons","Yes. So, I would say broadly speaking, North America is stronger than international. It was interesting to see the I think the U.K. retail sales come out this morning that were fairly strong. So, maybe that's European tourists going into the U.K.","But broadly speaking there have been more challenges versus North America, and I would say that is probably somewhat attributable to global geopolitical uncertainties. But it does vary by geography and it actually varies quarter-by-quarter.","Arthur Peck","Yes. I just -- we're still bullish on our international business. Obviously, I'm committed to it. But it's -- honestly, you have to look country-by-country at the end of the day. Old Navy, as an example, in North America and Canada, it's continued to be a very strong business.","If you look at what is I think a very interesting environment is in China right now, in the space that we're in. We're seeing the value business there; particularly with our Gap factory stores continue to be very good. But the customer is somewhat standing on the sidelines, which has resulted in a lot of very aggressive and early sale activity across the whole specialty channel. So, it's hard to really generalize overall, but I would agree with Sabrina, North America better and international more challenging.","Betty Chen","Thank you.","Jack Calandra","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder, the press release, which is available on gapinc.com, contains a full recap of our second quarter results as well as the forward-looking guidance included in our prepared remarks. As always, the Investor Relations' team will be available after the call for further questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tina Romani","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap Inc.\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements.","For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as the description and reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures as noted on page two of the slides supplementing Teri\u2019s remarks, please refer to today\u2019s earnings press release as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 28, 2019, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining me on the call today are President and CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Teri List-Stoll. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Art.","Art Peck","Hi everybody, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start by discussing the announcement we made this afternoon to separate Gap Inc. into two independent publicly traded companies, cleverly named NewCo and Old Navy. I'll then get into specifics around the quarterly results.","Our announcement today is an acceleration of our balanced growth strategy and an indication of my commitment to position all of our brands for success. With this plan we will stand up two independent companies creating a unique and differentiated portfolio of specialty brands in NewCo and standalone Old Navy. Both well-positioned to lead in the evolving retail landscape.","NewCo will bring Gap brand Athleta, Banana Republic, Intermix and Hill City into one operating model. I feel strongly that this combination of brands will be powerful. By bringing them together, we can better leverage capabilities and investments across the brands, share best practices and drive efficiencies to create value for all stakeholders.","NewCo will have approximately $9 billion in annual revenue, a strong balance sheet and a significant opportunity to innovate, explore new ways to serve the customer and quite frankly what's on my mind is to write the next chapter for specialty retail. I also believe NewCo will be positioned to take a global leadership role in sustainability. It's the ethos of this company and the ethos of these brands.","In Old Navy, we have one of the fastest-growing apparel retailers in the United States with a winning business model and an impressive runway for future growth, including capitalizing on opportunities like opening new stores and expanding its new product categories. The standalone company will have approximately $8 billion in annual revenue and we'll be able to capitalize in a scale, broad consumer awareness and unique positioning to drive growth.","So why are we doing this? And why now? Our customers' preferences and shopping habits continue to evolve, which is challenging the traditional retail model. We have responded to this with our balanced growth strategy, which has positioned us well with investments in our global supply chain, our digital capabilities and an enhanced and evolving omni-channel customer experience, while at the same time improving operational efficiencies across the company.","But over time, Old Navy's value creation levers, business model and customers have increasingly diverged from our specialty brands. That divergence to me is now clear. And we think the best way for each company to grow and meet the evolving needs of our customers is to allow them to pursue tailored strategies separately.","The separation presents us with a unique and catalyzing moment to simplify what we are doing and how we're doing it. With more focused companies, decision-making can be accelerated. And I'm confident that we will be able to move quickly and with agility to serve our customers.","Let me describe what each of these companies is going to look like in a bit more detail starting with NewCo. Following the separation, I will become the CEO of NewCo. I'm excited to lead and continue to lead these great brands under a different structure that will create clearer focus on what is necessary to deliver improved profitability in our mature brands: Gap Banana and Intermix. We are capitalizing on the momentum and the newly launched Hill City.","With approximately $9 billion in revenue, NewCo will continue to have scale, but will be better positioned to drive sustainable growth, improved profitability by levering a scale of operating platform to deliver distinctive products and experiences to an attractive and loyal customer that significantly overlaps.","In NewCo, we have the advantage of iconic brands. But we also have a business that needs to evolve and change. With our concurrent announcements on restructuring the Gap brand specialty fleet, we have a smaller, healthier base of stores that provide a critical component of the omni experience that our customers demand.","In addition, we will continue to grow with the value trends in the industry in our outlet and factory business across the portfolio. And thoughtfully evolve specialty access through locations and formats that serve our customers shifting shopping patterns.","The NewCo challenge and the NewCo opportunity is to provide truly frictionless access across stores and digital, to continue to harness the power of data from cross brand shoppers and to become what I call radically more responsive to our customers.","As I mentioned earlier, NewCo will be uniquely positioned to grow its leadership also in sustainability and social responsibility. It can build off the B Corp Certification recently earned by Athleta to potentially become the largest publicly traded B Corp, positively impacting the environment, our employees, our vendors and our customers.","Responsibility has been a foundational element of Gap's history and we have the opportunity and obligation to lead the industry going forward.","Turning to Old Navy which I am quite honestly equally excited about. As the number two apparel brand in the U.S. with approximately $8 billion in annual revenue, Old Navy will be able to capitalize on its scale, broad customer awareness and unique positioning to extend its category leadership, maximize revenue growth and deliver the profitable growth as an independent company.","Sonia Syngal who has led Old Navy since 2016 will continue as the CEO of the standalone company. She has a proven track record of results leading Old Navy's most recent transformation and driving product-to-market innovations that serve all of our brands. She also has deep experience managing and optimizing the supply chain and manufacturing both at Gap Inc. and at other industries.","With its U.S. store footprint underpenetrated versus the value peers, Old Navy will have improved focus and operating discipline that will enable it to increase customer access through new stores, including in-fill locations and smaller markets where our tests indicate substantial opportunity.","Old Navy will continue to evolve its omni-channel model and we'll have the opportunity to expand its product categories and market presence to continue to successfully resonate with value, focused consumers.","I look forward to seeing where Sonia and the team take Old Navy. I and all Gap Inc. shareholders have vested interest in that success.","Teri will discuss some specifics of the transaction in more detail. But before I hand it over to her, let me switch gears and hit some highlights of our Q4 and fiscal year results.","Overall, the quarter did not live up to what I know our brands can deliver. And we did not finish the year as strongly as expected. As others have pointed out in the industry, the macro environment played a role. But we know we could do better and we are committed to doing better in the areas of the business that we control.","That said, as we look back on the year, there's many things to be pleased with. We made good progress on our productivity goals and disciplined choices to deliver our guidance. We saw the continued renewal of Banana Republic with positive trends and a stronger foundation. We continue to see market share gains at Athleta and Old Navy, and we made meaningful investments in technology to drive future growth and efficiency.","Before I dig into our fourth quarter performance of Old Navy, I think it's important to put into context the health of the brand, which remains strong and a market leader in the value space. And I just really want to start this conversation by saying; I have a 100% confidence in the Old Navy business and the Old Navy business model.","2018 was a record year for the brand delivering comp growth of 3% or 9% on a two-year stack. And the brand continues to operate at very healthy margin rates leading The Gap Inc. portfolio.","Underlying this success was a large and healthy active file of high-value multi-channel customers that grew double-digits in 2018. The brand also nicely grew its high-value multi-channel shopper base.","Old Navy has successfully introduced new product to the assortment that have quickly become must-have staples, such as fleece, puffers and fashion outerwear. These add to the continued strength in tees and jeans for the entire family. Old Navy continues to play and win across a wide range of merchandise categories, with continued room to grow.","Looking after the quarter, and after -- looking \u2013 sorry, looking at the quarter, after a strong start in November and through the Black Friday weekend, Old Navy, like other concepts experienced deceleration in traffic in the middle of December.","And we quickly began hind-sighting the trend. While there may have been some macro issues at work, we also recognized we could've done more to engage with our customers to drive traffic during this typical low in the season.","We also acknowledge that our assortment did not provide enough newness or excitement and that our investments and products were more heavily skewed to repeated winners leaving less room to flex into better performing items.","While we are generally not satisfied with our execution for the holiday and should've been able to drive a better Q4 result, we know and I know the pants momentum remains solidly positive.","Old Navy is still an incredibly exciting growth story and I remain very confident in the brand health and the leadership team's continued focus on delivering exceptional product, fresh marketing, superior customer experiences and continuously pursuing operational excellence to drive growth.","Turning to Banana, overall 2018 was a year of progress that strengthens our confidence in the relevance and potential for Banana Republic. With the brand achieving a positive comp, coupled with 120 basis points of product margin expansion in 2018.","On the products side, Banana Republic grew market share across pillar categories including; sweaters, suiting and dresses and skirts. On the customer side, our connection with the customers at VR is getting even stronger and our customer base continues to grow as product acceptance ticks up.","Acquisition and reactivation rates improved over the last year reflecting marketing that now has a more consistent and brand-appropriate aesthetic. On the operations front, the team is now working more productively and efficiently from their single headquarters location in San Francisco.","In Q4 BR delivered margin expansion which was a continuation of their trend, underscoring the team's commitment to reducing the intensity of promotions used in the commercial plan.","In line with this strategy the brand pulled back on promotional levels during the quarter which was a detriment to traffic and ultimately competitors, during the highly competitive holiday season.","The team is continuing to assess the effectiveness of utilizing varying degrees of promotional messaging, particularly during event-driven periods such as holidays as they continue to focus on providing value and experience our customers expect, while continuing to drive margin expansion.","Overall the BR team is determined to capitalize on the momentum seen throughout this year and will incorporate key learnings from holiday as they continue to focus on building strength through customer reengagement and acquisition all the time, while reducing promotional intensity to drive further margin expansion.","Athleta. Zooming out for the year there's a lot for us to be proud about their performance. Another market share gaining year, we opened 13 stores ending the year with 161 stores. The Girls business remained spectacular, delivering an over 60 comp for the year.","The entire company received B Corp certification which is really resonating with customers and employees. The active customer file grew 20% exceeding their goals. And we launched our men's performance lifestyle business, Hill City.","In Q4 Athleta experienced similar traffic softness in December that we've spoken about. Although sales less traffic, a key indicator of product acceptance remained positive and held to year-to-date trends.","We continue to see tremendous market share opportunity and runway for growth in 2019 and beyond by leveraging the brand's differentiated positioning and purpose-driven mission our unique range of product offering and growing our capabilities in performance, fabric, innovation.","Moving on to Gap, as I committed last quarter we have taken thoughtful and decisive action to radically restructure our fleet to address stores that are underperforming or do not represent the best of Gap brand. Teri will get into more detail.","But looking ahead, we intend to close approximately 50% of our specialty stores. The majority of the closures will be concentrated in North America leaving us with a smaller, but healthier specialty fleet.","While there's work to do on the remaining fleet including continuing to reduce square footage and bringing stores to brand standards we are confident these closures will play an important role in revitalizing the brand.","After the closures, we expect to see significant improvement in channel mix with our profitable online and outlet businesses representing approximately two-thirds of the business and specialty the other one-third down from about half today.","As I mentioned last quarter, our market research strongly supports the view that Gap remains a relevant brand with strong emotional equities. As challenging as 2018 was logo sales which to me are an indication of the equity the brand were up 11% globally. To me this is a clear sign that the relevance of the brand and even more importantly the strong emotional connection with and pride in the brand like Gap.","It's clear the potential for future growth and penetration is there. We just need to give our customers the quality, fit and style they want. And to address those issues, we've been focusing on improving the product engine of the business on three fronts: Process improvement as you know we are adopting best practices from across the company, while driving a culture of continuous improvement; talent and structure, super important and critical to me.","Neil has been in the building now for about six months and he's been investing in the right talent and structure for Gap brand; clear lines of accountability for our channels and regions; dedicated teams to get North America specialty and outlet; we recently announced the appointment of Alegra O'Hare as Chief Marketing Officer formerly with adidas.","Alegra is a marketing innovator with extensive experience leading a major brand through a creative turnaround and frankly a major brand through a revitalization and we are thrilled to have her skills and her perspective on board; and lastly category strategy.","Denim is the core of Gap brand and we are and we will be leading with denim. We recognize the competition in the market for denim, but the market is large and the market is attractive and is the essence of Gap brand.","The world we live in is divisive. This really gets to the core of Gap brand's equities and the heart of the brand. We believe and our customers tell us there's something really special about what Gap brand can do to bridge the Gap.","By leveraging the strengths of our iconic brand to offer products and an experience that celebrates individuality, drives inclusion and brings us together. We have our work cut out for us this we acknowledge. But we know what we need to do to win. And we are committed to restructuring the fleet and revitalizing Gap brand to unlock shareholder value and drive profitable growth.","As we've already outlined in this call there are many opportunities to drive profitable growth in our amazing brands. I intend to continue to pursue those tirelessly and aggressively both strengthen the results of Gap Inc. to 2019 and to set both NewCo and Old Navy up for success as independent companies. This is somewhat of a historic moment for the company one where we begin to chart the course in our 50th year for the next 50 years.","We are creating two compelling companies that will have the ability to drive growth and value for customers, employees, shareholders for many years to come. We have a lot of work to do before the separation.","We are just beginning the detailed planning to support the execution and I will not allow this to distract us from delivering on the current business so that our brands enter their next phase healthy, strong and poised for growth.","With that Teri, I'll turn it over to you.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks Art and good afternoon everyone. In the interest of time I'll be quite brief in my comments to leave time for Q&A which I expect there are a few. Let me start with some additional information on the separation announcement.","We expect that the separation will be effective through a spin off to Gap Inc. shareholders that is intended to generally be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Once the separation is complete, Gap Inc. shareholders will receive a pro rata distribution of the shares of NewCo and Old Navy stock. The ratio of shares that will be distributed will be determined prior to the actual separation.","We currently expect the transaction to be completed in 2020 subject to certain conditions, including final approval by Gap Inc.'s Board of Directors, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and certain other customary conditions.","After the separation, NewCo and Old Navy are expected to be appropriately capitalized with sufficient liquidity to support both planned operating and investment plans as well as capital allocation philosophies. Its early days in the execution planning process. So I'm sure, you'll have a number of questions that we are not prepared to answer definitively at this point.","As we move through the process towards separation, we are committed to full and transparent disclosure to ensure a complete understanding of the transaction and its implications. This is an important and transformational step for Gap Inc. one that affects our employees, our investors, partners, vendors, other stakeholders and one that we certainly haven't taken lightly.","It has become increasingly clear that our balanced growth strategy, while successful in building necessary capabilities in areas like supply chain and digital capability that are important to a scaled operating platform, no longer effectively supports the diverging needs of Old Navy versus our traditional specialty brands. Now is the right time for us to take the next step on our journey to both ensure the competitiveness of our brands and to deliver shareholder value.","Next, let me just share a bit more detail regarding the Gap specialty fleet rationalization we announced today. The Gap brand, as Art mentioned, is an important component of both Gap Inc. and the proposed NewCo portfolio. And this is an important step to improve the profitability of the specialty channel.","So we started the year of 2018 with 725 global specialty stores, excluding China, which continues to be a growth market for us. Between the 68 specialty stores that we closed this year and the 230 additional specialty closures that we announced today, this represents closure of nearly half the fleet and there will be additional natural expirations and closures beyond 2020.","To identify the stores for closure, we focus on those that were not delivering appropriate levels of contribution were in the wrong locations or otherwise were not a strategic fit in the fleet.","Our objective is to ensure the remaining fleet is located and sized appropriately and can generate sufficient returns toward the investment to remain brand appropriate and provide a positive customer experience.","To accomplish these closures, we are balancing the need to move aggressively, but economically. There are approximately 150 closures that will take place as leases naturally expire over the next two years.","In that same timeframe, we also are actively pursuing more rapid closures of about 75 and up to may be 100 stores that do not meet our criteria for retention. We expect the stores with the most significant losses will be closed by the end of fiscal year 2019.","In total, we expect these decisions to result in annualized pre-tax savings of about $90 million. It's important to note that we expect an annualized sales loss of about $625 million from the closure of these stores.","And we estimate restructuring costs of about $250 million to $300 million with the majority expected to be cash expenditures. Through these stores, we will have a smaller healthier base of stores that play an important role in the omni experiences our customers demand.","In addition, we\u2019ll continue to focus on growth in our online channel which we expect to evolve to over 40% of our business as we restructure the specialty fleet. We believe Gap brand will be well-positioned to compete effectively with an omni model that offers locations, formats and experiences that serve our customers' shifting shopping patterns.","Let me now briefly summarize our fourth quarter and full year results. While 2018 present some challenges, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered fiscal year earnings per share within the original guidance we set at the beginning of the year.","As a reminder both fourth quarter and full year results are negatively impacted by the loss of the 53rd week which amounted to about $0.06 of EPS for the year and $0.16 for the fourth quarter. Additionally our reported 2018 results include the presentation changes from the adoption of the new RevRec standards the impact of which is presented on our website.","So, to the details, the net sales for the quarter were $4.6 billion with comp sales down 1%. For the full year net sales were $16.6 billion up slightly over last year when excluding the presentation changes from the adoption of the new RevRec standards. Comp sales for the year were flat compared to the positive 3 last year.","At Old Navy Q4 comp sales were flat against last year's 9%. For the year Old Navy's comp sales were up 3% as we continue to grow share. As Art mentioned, while the Old Navy brand remains fundamentally strong, the fourth quarter was disappointing particularly in stores.","Our online trends remain very strong with double-digit increases in traffic and conversion during the quarter. That said in both channels there certainly were growth [ph] factors at work. But we also missed opportunities around both newness in product and effectiveness of commercial plans.","We've hind-sighted some of the execution misses that are within our control to incorporate learnings into next year's plan. The leadership team is also diving in to better understand and quickly correct some product softness we continue to see around women's, wovens and dresses.","At Gap the Q4 comp sales were down 5% against the flat comp last year. As expected a more balanced assortment helps drive an improvement in margin trends versus last quarter.","At Banana Republic Q4 comp sales were down 1% against a positive 1% comp last year. The Q4 comp results reflect the team's continued focus on reducing promotional levels which delivered margin expansion in the quarter, but negatively impacted traffic during the competitive holiday season.","We continue to be pleased with the brand's progress and look forward to the team continuing to refine and build upon strategy that have driven performance improvement in recent performance.","Athleta delivered another good quarter on top of last year's remarkable trends resulting in a tier comp of nearly 30% positive. While Athleta's performance remained strong, we also have a little room to do better there. Lastly our online channel had another strong year exceeding our goal with over $3.6 billion in sales representing a mid-teens growth rate over last year.","Moving to gross margin, on a reported basis Q4 gross margin was 35.6%, a $123 million or about 140 basis points of expansion was driven by the presentation changes from RevRec adoption.","Excluding that impact the fourth quarter gross margin declined 260 basis points driven by the merchandise margin decline of 150 basis points and 110 basis points of rent and occupancy deleverage resulting from the loss of the 53rd week.","Merch margin deleverage was primarily driven by Old Navy and Gap. With the strength of our online business during the quarter, we did experience some deleverage related to shipping expense.","As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to have opportunities to optimize our shipping cost going forward. Deleverage in rent and occupancy was primarily driven by the loss of the 53rd week.","For the full year on a reported basis, gross margin was 38.1%, $443 million or about 130 basis points of expansion was driven by the presentation changes from RevRec. Excluding that impact, fiscal 2018 gross margin declined 150 basis points driven by a merch margin decline of 140 basis points and 10 basis points of rent and occupancy deleverage.","On SG&A. On a reported basis fourth quarter total operating expenses were $1.3 billion. The presentation changes from RevRec resulted in a $123 million increase in operating expenses and accounted for 170 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Excluding that impact fourth quarter SG& A as a percentage of sales leveraged 270 basis points. This leverage in the quarter was largely driven by a decrease in bonus payments.","In the face of a challenging holiday performance and in line with our priority of driving a performance culture, we made the difficult but appropriate and necessary decision to decrease our bonus payout for the year.","For the full-year, total operating expenses were $5 billion. The presentation changes from RevRec resulted in a $443 million increase in operating expenses and accounted for 160 basis points of operating expense deleverage.","Excluding that impact, full year SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 100 basis points exceeding our previous guidance and underscoring both our commitment to delivering results in a disciplined manner and executing against our productivity initiatives.","I'm very pleased to report that we exceeded our internal productivity goal by identifying and actioning against about $300 million of productivity savings this year. As a reminder, prior to 2018, we had been deleveraging SG&A by about 170 basis points as we ramped up investments. With the help of our productivity efforts, we were able to increase our investment in technology and digital capabilities, while also leveraging SG&A.","During the fourth quarter, we finalized our provisional amounts related to the enactment of the TCJA resulting in a fourth quarter effective rate of 24.4% and a fiscal 2018 effective tax rate of 24.1%.","And turning to earnings, our fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share were $0.72 compared with reported earnings per share of $0.52 last year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 excluding the net impact of tax reform in 2017.","Full year 2018 earnings per share including the benefits of the lower tax rate were $2.59 compared with reported earnings per share of $2.14 last year and adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 excluding the net impact related to tax reform in 2017 and the second quarter gain from insurance proceeds related to fixed assets.","Our fiscal 2018 free cash flow was $676 million compared with $715 million last year which included $66 million of insurance proceeds related to property and equipment. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as well as $288 million of short-term investments.","Regarding capital and store counts, fiscal 2018 capital expenditures were $705 million below our previous guidance of $750 million as we reduced capital expenditures in response to more challenging operating performance. And now, moving to 2019, on a reported basis we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.26.","Excluding costs associated with our restructuring plans we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.55. The guidance range does not incorporate any cost associated with preparing for and executing the separation we announced today. We will provide visibility to those as the plans develop and as the costs are incurred.","As I mentioned we made the difficult but necessary decision to reduce bonus payout. As we look to 2019, we expect reinvestments in our bonus plan that will better reflect the performance culture aligning employee and shareholder interest while enabling us to attract and incent talent that is motivated to fuel our path forward.","As we reset our bonus payout and lap the minimal payout this year this may cause our expense to deleverage next year. With that in mind, let me take you through some expectations for the first half. We do expect the first half to be more challenging.","As it has been widely published February has been unseasonably cool. The historically cold start to the year has impacted all of our businesses particularly Old Navy which tends to be the most weather sensitive.","While we are seeing double-digit comps in seasonal cold weather products such as denim, fleece, sweaters we are also seeing softness across spring seasonal categories.","Secondly, as I previously mentioned the Old Navy leadership team is diagnosing some of the product acceptance softness around women's wovens and dresses which we expect to improve in the back half. Our margin for the first half will be more challenged.","In addition to the reasons just mentioned the Gap brand continues to work through its brand revitalization and fleet restructuring. As a result we expect an improvement in second half comp and margin trends for Gap brand compared to the first half of the year.","Based on this we currently expect adjusted first half earnings per share to decrease relative to EPS for the same period last year. We currently expect a high-teens percentage decrease.","Regarding capital expenditures, we expect fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of about $750 million which includes about $100 million of expansion cost related to one of our headquarters buildings and the build out of our Ohio distribution center.","Additionally, at the start of the year we entered into a transaction to purchase our Old Navy headquarters building in anticipation of deferring the gain on sale of another building. The net cash out flow of the exchange is expected to be approximately $100 million to $150 million.","Regarding company-operated stores including closures related to the Gap brand fleet restructuring we expect to close about 50 company-operated stores, net of openings and repositionings. Openings will continue to be focused on Old Navy and Athleta.","Our cash priorities have not changed. We are maintaining our current dividend rate, which currently provides a 4% yield. However, given the restructuring efforts this year, and the spend related to the purchase of the Old Navy headquarters and expansion of our Ohio DC, we intend to reduce our share repurchase levels in 2019. Our current thinking is to repurchase at least sufficient shares to cover the dilution from our option exercises or approximately $50 million per quarter.","A few other relevant metrics. We currently expect fiscal 2019 comp sales to be flat to up slightly. We currently do not expect a meaningful impact from foreign exchange to EPS in 2019, and we expect a full year effective tax rate of about 26%.","Also in fiscal 2019, we will be adapting the new FASB lease accounting standard. The adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our income statement, but it will result in a substantial gross up on our balance sheet to recognize a lease liability and right of use asset for our leases. We are applying the standard prospectively in Q1 with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings.","So just to close out, this is an exciting time as we position our brands to once again play a leadership role in reinventing the retail experience. For the upcoming year, we have two priorities: To continue to strengthen the performance of our brands with improved execution; and to prepare for the separation that will create two new standalone public companies that are uniquely positioned to win with customers and for shareholders.","So with that, we will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question will come from Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. Hi, guys. Congratulations on the strategic direction. I think it's a great move by the company. I guess Art or Teri, I wanted to ask last time we got disclosure around margins by division Old Navy was around mid-teens marks. Obviously the weather is going to impact that a little bit because of markdowns, et cetera.","But I was just curious, just because people will be interested on the call here to get some sense of how to value Old Navy properly now that it\u2019s being split off. Do you see Old Navy as more of that kind of stable mid-teens type of operating margin business? Just curious on your thoughts there on how we should be thinking about that over time given such a very stable type business model.","And then second, as it relates to Gap division, you gave some great color last quarter that showed the various, almost profit differences, margin differences between Gap Specialty versus Gap Outlet versus Gap Online.","Any kind of update to that, and how we should be thinking about how the store closures of the Gap Specialty side help to get to a normalized profit margin rate for the entire Gap division. Because I think that will be helpful to people as well as to how should we be thinking about what could Gap divisional segment margins kind of look like going forward on a normalized basis once these stores are closed. Thanks guys.","Teri List-Stoll","Sure. Thanks, Randy. So you will over time get a great deal of transparency on both of the questions you asked.","We will of course as we move forward towards separation have audited financial statements for Old Navy that will have a great deal of detail and the same for NewCo. The way we see Old Navy is having tremendous growth prospects both in terms of the top line growth levers that Art mentioned but also in terms of margin expansion over time.","There's no question that in 2018, Old Navy margins did take a bit of a hit particularly from the fourth quarter trends that we talked about today such a big part of the year that is difficult to recover from that.","And as we often do because Old Navy is such a units business the most responsible thing for us to do when traffic flows is to move through that inventory take the necessary markdowns and the margin impact and move forward so that we can continue to start clean.","And so we saw all of the facts. But that is not what we believe is the long-term trajectory of the brand. Very much the Old Navy is having growth opportunity in both the top and the bottom line going forward. ","With respect to Gap, we talked about that magnitude of the impact of the closures in specialty as we look forward in terms of their contributions to total company. So obviously dramatically changing the complexion of the specialty channel and changing the mix of the business across the channels for the Gap brand.","We are not going to get into specific margin rate for the Gap brand or the specific channels other than to say that as we continue to drive forward with not just the fleet restructuring but with the overall brand revitalization we see again opportunity for tremendous margin progress there over time and we will certainly continue to paint that picture with the additional specifics necessary to understand the progress and timeline as we move through and prepare for the separation.","Randy Konik","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon everyone. Congratulations on moving forward to extract greater value. Art and Teri as you think about the puts and takes of separating the businesses we've talked in the past about supply chain, manufacturing systems. How do you think about separate businesses? And they're still big but what expense changes do you envision from having separate businesses? Thank you.","Art Peck","Thanks Dana. It's Art and I'll let obviously Teri chime in on this one as well. And when you put your finger on a big part of the work that we've been doing because the benefit of scale and size is a real benefit, to your point these are still going to be frankly substantially larger than the average apparel company or companies.","And so we feel a number of places are far enough down the scale curve that we can actually hold onto that and continue to move forward. We have done some work on looking at what the potential dis-synergies would be.","We are continuing to work on our technology stack and some opportunities that we have there. We are certainly doing the work back end from a supply chain standpoint.","There is a -- I guess I would point out here and we will talk more about this I'm sure but the -- probably what really got me there frankly and why I want to move with urgency on this and I'm so committed to -- believe this is the path forward is that there has been an accelerating divergence between the businesses with the path for Old Navy and the path for the other businesses.","And that's also true on the back end with our vendors where there is more alignment with Old Navy and less overlap with the other brands. The other brands overlap each other, but overlap Old Navy less.","The other side of it is, I continue to believe and I know Teri feels the same way that we are a long way from done with the productivity opportunity in the company. And we've made progress. In my mind not enough progress and not progress fast enough. And I am very acutely aware and focused on the fact that a catalytic event like this can help us potentially accelerate that. So while I'm not going to give specifics right now. I know you really like those. We will continue to work those.","And I'll just reiterate Teri's commitment in her remarks, which is a lot of questions we can't answer right now. We are quite confident that we have done the work to get us to this point in forming the fact that we believe this is a very significant and important step and it does unlock significant value creation potential.","As we continue to do the work and learn things, we are going to be as transparent as we possibly can to really show you what these two new companies look like, and what the puts and takes are associated with this. But we are confident this is the right thing to do, absolutely confident.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mark Altschwager with Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. Thanks. Art, I don't know if you'll be able to answer this at this point. But what strategies do you have in mind for Gap brand that you think will be better executed as a standalone company versus part of Old Navy? I mean do you see major changes untapped to the makeup of the assortment, the target customer, the pricing architecture? I guess big picture, where do you see Gap's sweet spot in the next chapter of specialty retail?","Art Peck","Well, I mean the first thing we've done obviously is with the step on store closures is to pretty radically remix the channel exposure. And that's important. This is the remixing of the channel exposure is something that every retailer that has been dominant in the higher end of the specialty apparel segment is going to need to do. And I frankly see Gap leading the way in informing some of the things we need to do.","We are going to close some stores inside Banana Republic. Overall Banana has a much healthier fleet. But we are going to take this opportunity to close some stores that we don't think in the same way have attractive economics that are right for the brand. And we've been pretty purposeful and intentional about, frankly not building Athleta as a business of the past, but rather a business of the future.","So it's less about the specifics of Gap brand than the divergence between the needs and opportunities in Old Navy and the needs of the specialty brands. And that divergence is fleet the specialty brands have more like in their fleets than not. They both have outlet businesses, Athleta does not. They have an international footprint, Old Navy less so. And then technology options as well. A simple example would be is that Old Navy's use and need for a mobile POS solution is quite different because of the in-store service model than an Athleta or Banana Republic.","And part of what got me here, and frankly why I really have a lot of energy about this is, I found myself in the process of allocating capital and OpEx for investment decisions, increasingly negotiating compromises in the portfolio that frankly were the least bad solution versus highly optimized for the two different business models.","And so I'm a big believer that least bad solutions aren't the best way to win, and therefore a lot of this is just getting that focus, that focus around investments, that focus around alignment of incentives, the purity of what these two businesses need to do. And it's going to make the work a lot easier and a lot faster as well.","And then there's just a couple of points of alignment which is I am big on the sustainability thing. It's not that Old Navy isn't there as well. But I think we can get there really fast with NewCo and we know that matters to our customers.","And I think we are going to see it matter to our customers at an accelerating rate. That's kind of a gift with purchase if you will but it is an important one for me. I don't know Teri if you want to say anything more. No?","Teri List-Stoll","I think you've tackled the focus point more and more often over the past year or so. In particular we have found ourselves having to debate internally what's right for Old Navy versus what's right for one of the other brands.","And often particularly if you think about the needs of Old Navy versus in Athleta whether that's web investments or data analytics investments or technology tools that as Art mentioned more, more often you're coming with quite different answers for Old Navy versus the other specialty brands.","And then as Art said you're forced with suboptimal choices. So this feels like an absolutely right way to set Old Navy up to continue to exploit its growth opportunity unencumbered by suboptimal compromises with the other brands and vice versa for the NewCo brand to really be able to continue to focus on reinventing retail and being leaders in their spaces.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will take a question from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Good afternoon. Teri this is a question on the store closures. So the $230 million how are they distributed globally and how many are flagships if any?","And then from the perspective of I think you said 150 of them are going to come off of natural lease expirations or lease options. So the $250 million to $300 million of cash is that just for the remaining $80 million? If you can give any color on that that will be very helpful. Thank you.","Teri List-Stoll","Sure, sure. So the 230 stores are global but they are largely located in the U.S. So that is where the majority of them are. And yes there are flags included in that number. We are -- we really -- Art mentioned this in the earlier calls.","We've really challenged the old-fashioned notion of what a flag should be, how big it should be and how much you're willing to invest in negative contribution for our flag. And we have been very selective in retaining a certain number of flags that are we believe have been very selective in retaining a certain number of flags that are we believe in flag.","And we have been very selective in retaining a certain number of flags that are we believe necessary to drive customer engagement customer acquisition in key geographies. But very thoughtful about how we want those to appear and how many of those we need.","So you're right that the 150 that I cited will be the natural expirations which leaves us call it $80 million-ish -- or 80 -- 80 stores not 80 million stores. And those 80 stores are largely what's making up the restructuring costs. There are things beyond closures included. You have some severance and...","Art Peck","Inventory issues yes.","Teri List-Stoll","Inventory and books value write-off. But that is largely related to those 80 or so stores. And part of the reason for the number is they tend to be longer lease terms and they tend to be\u2026","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Yes.","Teri List-Stoll","--the flags. So there is additional expense. But we very much have looked at the projected future losses associated with those leases and come up with what we think is economic way to deal with it.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","And then just in terms of inventory buys for this year for Gap, do they contemplate say half of them are they at the end of this fiscal year or are they weighted toward the Q1 of each of those years?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes enclosures are. Sorry.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","No, go ahead.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, so they are weighted toward the end of 2019 and we are planning our inventory appropriately to minimize the write-off that would come with closure. And obviously we are pretty aggressive. We've -- unfortunately been doing this for a while. We know to close Gap specialty stores and minimize the inventory impact. This is a bit larger scale, but we are planning for it.","Art Peck","We're not going to -- I'm not concerned about inventory overhang that's unplanned here.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant","Perfect, great. Great luck with the new strategy.","Teri List-Stoll","Thank you. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Next your question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks. So at the Gap brand, may be Art, what categories do you see is fixable by -- versus areas you see taking more time? And then similarly should we expect negative same-store sales at the Old Navy concept in the front half of the year? May be just the timeframe you see necessary to restabilize that concept?","Art Peck","Well Teri and I were both kind of looking at each other wondering where that came from.","Teri List-Stoll","Matt. May be we could say I think Art -- we are not going to give you Old Navy comp guidance for the quarters. But certainly, we didn't mean to imply that there is some tremendous overhang in Old Navy, quite the opposite. There are a lot of categories in Old Navy that are doing very well.","We have the weather which is a factor for sure. You've seen that in a lot of companies. It\u2019s something we are dealing with and we will work through. And then somewhat what I would characterize as relatively minor product opportunities that we are going to work through in the first half.","Art Peck","Yes I don't -- in no way shape or form I'll just say it again do I view Old Navy as sick in any way shape or form. Brand health is good. We are retooling our marketing on the right schedule which is what we do every period to refresh that. ","Teri List-Stoll","Still growing share. ","Art Peck","Yes, still growing share, impressive two-year stack. I would love to have done better in the holiday. I think we have a pretty good handle on what we should have done to do better. But I don't even -- I was going to say it's not sick. I'm not even sure it's a little cold quite honestly.","I said for a long time that we are in a business where not every quarter is going to be perfect and this quarter wasn't perfect. But that is way-way different than there being any fundamental issue with the business model, the health of the brand, the product offering, the capabilities of the team, all of that stuff. So I'm quite confident. And quite honestly, I wouldn't have gone down this path if I felt like we had it repair job on our hands right now. I don't feel that way in any way shape or form.","Matthew Boss","That's great. And then just with the Gap brand?","Art Peck","Well you said fix. As we know, fixed is a relative thing. We are -- I'm quite confident with what we are seeing. We are seeing key category improvement period-over-period. You know we brought Pam Wallack in now a few months ago. Pam and I worked together in the last significant successful turnaround of Gap brand.","Denim is at the core of the brand and there's a lot of attention focused there. We've made significant progress on the knits business both on reducing the number of CCs and styles and putting more depth behind the knits as well as improving the quality. And so, to me there's core categories that Gap has to stand for. It has to stand for denim.","And as we are getting into spring and into summer in the fall, we are absolutely on top of the high-rise trend, the super high-rise trend, the change in leg shape silhouette with a straight, with a cigarette, et cetera.","And then bringing it in a place where we haven't, which is a little bit more wash range and some more novelty, which has been working. We've just been modestly invested in those areas.","I am exceedingly pleased with what I've seen in men's, men's development season-over-season. And then kids and baby continues to be a very solid strong business for us. So it's really about women's and those key categories, and denim and knits have been two with fleece on top of that and we are in a fleece moment.","We are investing bigger in fleece as we get into spring, summer and fall. It should be a place where Gap should be able to dominate and really own that. And we are putting the investment behind it to make it happen.","So again I've called the turn before. And I've eaten my words. I'm not calling a turn again. What I'm looking forward is period-over-period improvement, and I'm quite confident and comfortable with what I'm seeing.","Matthew Boss","Great color. Thanks.","Operator","Next we will take a question from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. Hey, guys. Art, can you give us a ballpark, dissynergy range that factors into the equation that help you determine the separation made sense? And also curious about the website. All brands operate on the same platform. Is the plan for Old Navy to no longer be linked to the other brands online? I'm curious what kind of crossover shopping you have between Old Navy and the other brands online. Thanks.","Art Peck","Yes. So I'm not going to give you the dissynergy number right now frankly, because the really relevant number here is going to be what's the net. And as you can imagine and something is material is this, we've been working this with a very able group inside the company, but it's a very small group. We believe we've got the right people inside the tent.","As I said before, to make sure that we were stage gating this, and not going to get hung up on a structure issue or a cost issue or a tax issue or something like that. So we are confident that number one, it's the right thing to do, and number two, we can get it done.","We have a lot of work to do on both really getting into the substance of the dissynergies and then the offset of the dissynergies. And so Teri and I go back and forth on this, but we both have, I would say very aggressive objectives when it comes to minimizing the dissynergies and getting the maximum out of accelerated SG&A productivity. So from that standpoint.","On the website to be determined quite honestly how we shake that all around. We do have some overlap with Gap overlap saw Old Navy the most Banana and Athleta by far the least Hill City and Intermix certainly the least. But I'm not ruling anything out here, and obviously the world is filled with a number of people attempting to stand up third party marketplaces right now, third party digital marketplaces.","I have one right here in this company. And so I'm sure Sonia is going to want to as our the executives in NewCo going to want to preserve as much economic value as possible, and we figured that one out. So that is a to-be-determined also, but I wouldn't jump to conclusions.","Paul Lejuez","How about on the distribution center side? How many distribution centers are shared between Old Navy and the other brands?","Art Peck","Again we are doing the work. We feel like the assets actually has physical units not pretty well to the brands. And so -- and scale really is pretty much inside the four walls. All those facilities are operating at a highly efficient level of productivity. So we don't see really don't see the distribution centers as being shared organs. We think it's going to be pretty clean when it comes to mapping to the brands.","Paul Lejuez","Thank you. Good luck.","Art Peck","Yes.","Operator","Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs has our next question.","Alexandra Walvis","Hey there thank you so much for taking my question here. Two questions for me. The first one was as you went through this process what other structural approaches you considered for this group of businesses.","And I supposed why this one came out on top. And then second question is on Old Navy. You mentioned in the prepared comments you think that this brand has an underpenetrated store base. Where do you think that that store base can get to in the long-term? Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes. On the -- I'm sorry I was just -- Teri and I were talking very quietly. What was -- the first question again was? Sorry?","Alexandra Walvis","Yes. The first question is you laid out this plan for the two businesses. I'm just wondering what other options and...","Art Peck","Yes, yes, right, right.","Alexandra Walvis","For the business.","Art Peck","Yes. So you can have confidence that we definitely boil the ocean in looking at all the combinations and permutations here. We felt we wanted to be exhaustive and we felt we owed it to board and the employees and our shareholders to look at those.","And so we really looked across the whole thing. We settled on this largely due to the business logic at the end of the day.","And then obviously how to manage the di-synergies at the same time and I hope that this indicates without attempting it any way shape or form to preview more is that as we said before we are focused on value creation and have no sort of emotional attachment to a particular combination of these businesses.","We believe this is the best way at this point in time to position both of these companies to create more value and more value consistently. But we did look at whether or not as an example Athleta should be in a different structure or something like that.","And we feel quite confident that these specialty businesses can significantly benefit by being bundled together right now with a much leaner operating model where they can move faster and also have focused investment priorities that really meet their needs the same with Old Navy.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. I will just add to that. You can imagine when you take a significant stuff like this the homework that you do and just to emphasize Art's point the range of options we obviously have looked at what we think we can deliver by staying together and continuing to drive the balanced growth strategy with as much focus and the productivity efforts that are part of that all the way to the other end of the spectrum of just sell off each of the brands for what you can get for the -- from them.","And we wouldn't want anyone to think that we just said well Old Navy is going to be great on a standalone basis which we definitely believe. And therefore by default we have NewCo not that at all.","Art Peck","Not that at all.","Teri List-Stoll","The intentional choice of how to position each of the brands in a way that can create value and we really do believe the combination and the unique portfolio that's created by bringing these brands together...","Art Peck","And minimize the di-synergies and maximize the productivity opportunity. And that on Old Navy stores I'm not going to really put a number out there right now. There's going to be ample opportunity to talk as we pull the essentially the roadshow together for both of these businesses and tell the story.","What we have been doing over the last couple of years because I am a big believer in this is placing stores in what would have traditionally been non-traditional markets or locations for Old Navy to validate the strategy. And these might be in-fill locations where like in the San Francisco Bay Area.","You look for trading patterns and you realize that we are missing stores in key places where consumers are living their lives. We know that there is an opportunity in markets that are smaller than the markets that we've traditionally put stores in.","And especially when you look at those markets and you realize that those are often markets that were served by very traditional legacy retailers often general merchandise retailers when a Kmart closes stores or Sears does or Penny's as was announced today et cetera those markets are often times increasingly underserved and we found great success with Old Navy in some of those smaller markets. The rents are oftentimes deminimis.","The customers are super loyal. Many customers in those markets because remember we have a significant percentage of cash consumers at Old Navy that actually don't have access to the brand through the digital expression of the brand.","And so what's really on our mind is here we have the number two apparel brand in the United States and a significant percentage of the population that doesn't have access to the brand. We think that's a real winning combination.","Alexandra Walvis","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on Old Navy. If you feel like you've fully diagnosed the problem because I think there were a few fashion misses in 3Q as well. So if you think that that is fixed for spring? And how quickly could you get that margin back on track at Old Navy specifically?","Art Peck","Yes there's always going to be a few fashion misses. And if you're going to hold, I don't mean you specifically, but if we're going to be held to the standard of perfection that's a tough standard. There's a reason they call it fashion and a reason they call it trend. And there's always going to be some of those.","We don't -- if I could go back and I compare it to Q4 of 2015 when Old Navy just definitively snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Q4, we had fashion misses. We were over assorted. We had a bow wave of inventory that we are pushing forward from the port backups et cetera and that was a mess and it took us two quarters to get out from that mess. Really Q4 and then we started to see the business turn as we got into Q2. And that was a mess.","I will say this again, I'm not going to predict the business turn. If I look at the business right now and I walked it with the team just a week ago when we looked at our product, I believe a little bit of warm weather would see a significant uptick in the business. And a lot of the categories that are in there right now would start to fly out the door.","So I don't -- this is not a wreck and redo by any stretch of the imagination. I'm beyond super solidly -- super solid about the business and about health of the brand and about the product that we have in the box.","Teri List-Stoll","And as we\u2019ve said there are a number of factors as we've done the hind-sighting to make sure that we are well-positioned and certainly as we start the first quarter where there is probably number one the marketing refresh that Art mentioned is going to be able to help us drive some traffic and then these product fixes in these couple of categories are likely to be more second-half benefit than first half.","But again to get the margin back on track, we actually -- Old Navy has probably industry-leading margin and certainly a portfolio leading margin. So we feel very good about the overall health. But we actually think it can do better.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question will come from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi regarding the separation what are your thoughts in terms of the data piece and the digital side with both speed to the consumer and the data scientists that you're employing across the organization and also supply chain?","Just curious on how that will manifest in the separation because there were benefits that you had and you also kind of had a customer through different parts of his or her life. So I am -- I would love your thoughts there. And I think you helped articulate this but why now in terms of the separation? Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes. The data piece and again I've talked about this. I'm sort of interested in this because I'm not sure we are getting a little bit of benefit. We are getting a lot of benefit as we talked about our strategy so I hope you don't get a lot of penalty as we talk about the fact that we are separating.","That all said, we've look very carefully at the data asset and we believe we have a relevant data life for both organizations that continues down the path of everything we are doing.","Quite honestly the use of the data again this is an element of the divergence of the two businesses, the use of the data we see as having differential benefits in the specialty businesses than in the Old Navy, Navy business whether it's personalization, whether it's marketing, whether it's predictive analytics to inform the buying process.","So, I don't in no way shape or form do I believe that we have anything other than a significant opportunity that was the same as what it was and we continued to pursue it. We do have customer overlap. And that's something that we are going to manage.","The file will be a property we think of both companies. That's something we need to sort out. It's been a healthy and growing file. And again there are different ways of working through this marketplace solutions and that kind of thing. So it's an issue.","We are aware of it. We are focused on it and again as we know more we will certainly come back and talk about what the implications are. There was a second question then. I was focused on the first. Or was there? Was that?","Oliver Chen","The second question was\u2026","Art Peck","Why now. As we've talked in the -- sorry go ahead.","Oliver Chen","That's all. Just that's exactly. Thank you.","Art Peck","Yes. Why now is I think, very straightforward and it may not be the answer that you're expecting. Why now is that we've done this work as I've mentioned several times on an ongoing basis for as long as I've been in the company where we've looked at the portfolio and the parts of the company and where there are other ways of operating the company that we believed led to better business outcomes.","Why now was frankly that we became convinced with the divergence of the business models and the needs of each business the investment requirements of the business and our ability to manage the dissynergy and the productivity that was the right thing to do.","And I believe very strongly that when you come to that point beyond reasonable probability of doubt when you move and you move quickly with urgency and with responsibility. And that's where we are right now. So why now was I believes, absolutely that is the right thing to do.","I'm energized and excited about both of these companies. The most painful thing to me was having, to choose between the two because I love Old Navy and have an incredible affinity for its business model and the purity of what it does in the growth opportunity in front of it.","But I'm also super excited about frankly the gift the opportunity and the imperative to reinvent specialty apparel retail because we all know what needs to happen. And I believe we are and we can continue to lead the way at an accelerating rate to monetize these brands in a different business model and surprise a lot of people.","Oliver Chen","Thank you and best regards.","Tina Romani","Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you and once again that does conclude our conference for today.

My name is Kevin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Gap Incorporated, First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per participant. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host Jenn Fall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations.","Jennifer Fall","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap, Inc.'s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements as well as a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures, as noted on page 2 of the slides supplementing Teri's remarks, please refer to today's earnings press release as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 18, 2017, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.","Joining me on the call today are President and CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Teri List-Stoll. As mentioned, Teri will be using slides to supplement her remarks, which you can view by going to the Investor section at gapinc.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.","Arthur Peck","Thanks, Jenn, and hello to everybody on the call, and thanks for joining us today.","So I'm sure you're all observing what's going on in the sector right now. We are as all. And obviously, we're continuing to see downsizing, bankruptcies, commentary about store traffic being soft and consumer spending really lagging the overall consumer sentiment in the marketplace. We're going to see as we go through the dialogue today that we of course are not immune to any of these challenges that are facing the industry as a sector, but we also believe quite strongly and we feel that the results of Q1 are continuing to validate that belief that we are uniquely positioned to turn these challenges into opportunities.","To pickup market share to grow and to really continue to serve our customers with the iconic brands that we have. To set to face these challenges but underlying that, apparel continues to grow. It is as you know a remarkably constant growth and that's a good thing. Additionally with everything that's happening in the sector, there was an unprecedented amount of market share coming fluidly into play and we're playing not just to survive the changes that's taking place, but to win in that environment.","Our brands are iconic and they are legitimately and objectively loved by our consumers and we continue to invest behind the plan that I've been talking to you about now for many quarters to strengthen our relevance to rebuild and enhance our product capabilities and to deliver an exceptional customer experience to both our stores and our digital assets.","Return to the quarter in a moment and Teri will share more on our financials and the specifics around guidance. But again, we're very pleased that our results in this quarter demonstrate the progress that we're making, the progress against the plan that we have been consistently executing against now for really since the time and somewhat before I stepped into this role.","We know we have important foundational work to continue to do, but the strong results in Old Navy and the strength that we're seeing in athletic confirm our confidence in our strategy and we're taking the right actions to be well-positioned to differentiate starting with product and our brands and our experiences and profitably and continuously capture market share.","Our priorities remained the same, product, foundationally sits on product that our customers love and we're well on the way and well into the journey of enhancing and evolving our product capabilities. Customer experience remained tantamount, brand health talent and importantly leveraging scale and operating discipline. They were our priorities when we spoke several quarters ago, they are priorities today. They will remain at the priorities as the entire organization is executing against.","Just for a moment on products. We have continued to do work to solidify the fit to enhance the quality to improve the value relationship of our products and to use responsive capabilities to ensure that our products are on trend and that we can deliver units into the market share opportunities that we see.","In February, I went into some more details on the work that we're doing and we continue to make progress. In Q1, we tested significantly more products versus a year ago which allows us to then inform larger buys that we're making many times based upon the demand signals that we're seeing in those tests.","We also use responsive capabilities in our product process and almost 60% more of our assortment and we have some categories now where they are 100% on responses and demand base buying and we're seeing the results that we expected to see associated with that.","We're also leveraging fabric platforming and importantly, we are working with fewer vendors more deeply. Just a couple of weeks ago, we held our global supplier summit where we hosted our top vendors and really continued to push into relationships with those vendors and again far few of them where we work much more deeply push into relationships where we are strategically connected, where we're leveraging their capabilities, where we're working together a season-over-season to enhance our cost and to drive innovation. These partnerships have been key to enabling us to work faster to change faster and to also respond to demand.","On the customer side, we see a continuing opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty, really by continuing to be focused on the customer experiences and it's an experience in our stores where we have a responsibility to deliver a compelling experience that our customers can't get any place else and it's the digital experience and it's how those two things are connect together. We are relentlessly focused on mobile as traffic continues to move to a mobile device. We launched our native mobile apps starting with Old Navy very recently to improve the customer experience and we've already seen customers rate those apps as materially better than the experience that we were delivering on a web-based app just several weeks ago.","And I've talked about operating discipline and in particular about what we call our best-in-class, best-in-cost operating model. There was leverage available out of that, some of which we have gotten, some of which remains in front of us, all of which we are committed to going after.","I'm pleased with the progress that we're making, but we have plenty of work to do and I cannot discount the macro environment that we're operating in.","So let me spend a moment and shift to talking about the brands. I'll start with Old Navy, a record quarter. I'm proud of the business and I'm proud of the brands and I'm proud of the team. The 8% comp was up against the tough quarter last year and it compares for the rest of the year due get harder, but an 8% comp is in an 8% comp. Clearly, out in front, the rest of the sector clearly gaining market share.","It's a family brand. We did well in Easter and the team did a great job gaining share in multiple categories. I'm probably most pleased by the fact to strengthen the business is very diversified this wasn't being driven while we had great successful categories like dresses where we remained number one. The success of the business was diversified across gender and across the family and that to me, signifies sustainable strength.","We've also talked for a while about the fact that Old Navy has been leading the company in some of the responsive capabilities and we're using these today to target the competition and importantly to put units into the business to support growth. It's a really good lesson as you look at the sector right now and you look at us. When you're buying responsively in a tough traffic environment, you buy units type and if traffic is negative, you will often buy units negative.","In any given season on a traditional pipeline, this really constrains you to yield improvement to get growth AUR, I will call that way and as we continue to develop responsive capabilities, category-by-category and brand-by-brand, it allows us to feel growth both with AUR and yield improvement and in selectively putting units in the business to chase market share and that 8% comp sits on a platform of both of those things and we're pretty confident about our ability to continue to exploit that to our benefit.","Another thing to characterize is Old Navy success is their story telling, the high fashion campaign is resonating with customers, it's continuing to enhance brand health and we are seeing better traffic trends in the industry, again due to everything, but not insignificantly due to the fact that we have a compelling story to tell about the brand and are telling in a compelling way.","On a side note, we also continue to see real-estate opportunity in front of us and we opened our first holistic small store format for the brand in Walnut Creek at Broadway Plaza just a few weeks ago. It's very early days and we are figuring out how to operationalize 8,000 square feet that really has a holistic expression of the brand, but we're pleased by what we're seeing so far and we really do feel like this is going to open up some interesting opportunities. And importantly, it's a store design that is supported by foundational aspects of operating discipline, fixtures, replenishment, service models, but also by leveraging technology selectively to serve the customer.","I'll turn to Gap. Transformational work continues and we're continuing to see signs under the covers that show progress and in particular how it showing up in margins. They are driving elements of the operating model work that we're going to deploy in the rest of the company particularly as it relates to continuing to define our demand base buying strengths. I'm confident that we'll continue to strengthen Gap and it will position it well for the future, but obviously we continue to have more work to do there.","On marketing which I spoken to you about during this period, we had the 90s archive reissue, which was really a small campaign supported by some product. In terms of showing the relevance of the brand that generated over 2 billion impressions for the brand and it shows you when we use the voice right, without spending a lot of money, how much consumer resonates there is out there for the message and the story that the brand can tell.","Inside the brand, active remains a success story, delivering double-digit comps on the quarter and as you know we are very bullish about the active category across much of the company. We're also continuing to see successful product innovation by launching our [scope] [ph] denim across active and in denim for Gap brand and strong consumer resonates for that innovation. Let me turn then for a moment and talk about Banana. I'm pleased with where Gap is, I'm inpatient for its progress, but I'm confident about what we're going to continue to see.","Moving to Banana, you would have seen that we have a new leader in Banana with Mark's Breitbard returning to the company. As you know, Mark has been a CEO in a multi-brand company over the last four years. I know Mark well and probably the most important thing right now, Mark knows the brand, Mark knows the company and Mark is hitting the ground running. So, I'm not going to promise when we're going to see the progress that will come from Mark's and the team's leadership, but I'm very confident that he got his arms around the key issues in that business and there are tremendous opportunities to make quick progress.","On our marketing and our store environment, I'm particularly passionate. We've been very quiet in our voice and the team knows that I'm not happy with consistency of execution and how we are presenting in our stores much improved product and I expect to see very rapid progress there.","Athleta, which we don't breakout is continuing to be an exceptional performer, one of our key growth brands. It's positioned in a growing segment. It has strength across the vectors of brand equity, product, experience and talent. And it's not just store growth, but growing categories, 60% of their bottoms platform are on responses and they could put units into the business against demand signals very, very quickly and that is part of what is fueling in our growth.","They're also a [reg] [ph] price business and so the bulk of their growth is not going to come out of yield, it is going to come out of feeding units into the business and it's one of the reasons that we are so confident that it's the right place to have pushed aggressively ahead with the responsive capabilities in a significant part of the business. They continue to rollout Athleta goal and we're seeing good signals from that and we're pleased with the incremental business as we've expressed that concept exclusively in existing real estate.","They are also doing something on the side which we're committed to as a company but Athleta models as well, which is a sustainability commitment. It's part of our story telling. It's part of how we do business. And importantly, it's also part of what customers are responding too and a resonant too as we tell the story to them about the brand.","We see an opportunity to continue to build Athleta to continue to build brand awareness to continue to acquire customers and to continue what to run, what is inherently an omni-channel business. And speaking of omni-channel, we have continued to make progress in our backend capabilities as well. We converted one DC in Q1 to a fully omni-DC, it is on our roadmap to convert two of those DCs into the second quarter and the second half of the year and to be clear what that allows us to do was to leverage one pool of inventory and take 999 accuracy for individual direct orders or case lot fulfillment into our stores out of the same pool of inventory.","Now, traffic remains an issue. We all know that you see the industry traffic numbers. As an industry in total, everybody will report conversion numbers somewhere between the mid to low 20s and the high 30s or low 40s depending upon the business. Clearly, the industry has a traffic issue, but I've inclined to turn this around just I'm inclined to say that headwinds are only headwinds if you're facing in the wrong direction. And the way we're really approaching this issue of conversion is turning on its head and saying that we have a conversion opportunity, not a traffic problem. And we're beginning to work right now. Frankly, we're accelerating work to push forward in a subset of our stores and really configure what I'm calling a high touch and frictionless experience and I have a strong philosophy that we need to run our stores to enable 100% conversion and I'll be the first to say that's not going to happen on the back of shoveling mass quantities of inventories into our stores and it starts with the fundamentals, it starts with staffing, it starts with replenishment models, it starts with respectfully displaying our product, but it also means layering in and continuing to layer in digital capabilities and allow our customer to frictionlessly purchase at our stores even if the style, color, combination isn't there on the shelf.","I'm a big believer in stores, but I'm also a big believer in digital. We will continue as we always have to manage square footage to why our customers are to support them on digital, to support them in our stores and to meet them wherever they are. Last, we continue to do what I call foundational work on our digital experience and there was money to be made by improving your page load speeds by modest personalization, by enhancing your search capabilities and as much as we talk about many of those other things we're proud of the experience that we offer our digital, we have an exceptional digital business and everyday we're committed to making it better.","So in summary, our focus on product and working upstream with our vendors is unrelenting. We will never take our eye of it. I've been asked when are you done and the answer is never. We will continue to work on improving fit, improving quality and showing that our product is on trend, we deliver a superior differentiated value proposition. We're focused on meeting our customers where they are on evaluating and involving the experience across our stores and online and we will always be focused on operating discipline and cost control.","This discipline will help us fund the investments in marketing, fund the investments in technology and in turn will strengthen our brands and our business. We view Q1 as continued progress, but to be clear, not as a victory and I have to underline one more time the current macro environment is unpredictable. So progress, validation, same plan we've talked to you about before we're head down focus on that where confidence going to continue to yield results.","And with that, let me turn it over to Teri.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks, Art, and good afternoon, everyone.","As we outlined last quarter, in 2017, we are focused on a few things, capitalizing on our initiatives to improve product quality to grow sales with healthy merchandise margins, investing strategically in the business to strengthen our brand equities and to support growth.","Maintaining operating discipline to drive efficiencies and leverage scale and returning excess cash to shareholders. We are pleased to report progress against each of these in the first quarter.","Starting with sales, comp sales were up 2% compared to a decline of 5% last year. Total company net sales for the quarter were $3.4 billion flat to last year. With respect to global brand comps, Old Navy as we said had a record quarter delivering 8% comps against a negative 6% last year. While showing progress throughout the quarter, Gap did end the quarter down 4% against the negative 3% last year. Banana Republic comp was also down 4% and [base] [ph] down 11%.","As you heard from other retailers, the quarter started out slow with traffic in spending down. Following that, we were pleased to see all of our brands execute well over the important Easter selling season particularly at Old Navy, which tends to realize outside's impact over key holiday period.","Moving to gross margins; our first quarter gross margin was up 270 basis points to 37.9%. Merchandize margin was up 220 basis points with positive AUR at all of our global brands. Despite the pre-opening cost associated with our Times Square flagship locations schedule to open in the back half of 2017, rent and occupancy leveraged 50 basis points just primarily driven by lower rent and occupancy expenses as a result of our international store closures last year.","Regarding SG&A, as anticipated total operating expenses were $1.05 billion up about $60 million from last year, it's driven primarily by an increase in payroll largely due to bonus accruals as well as increased marketing. Marketing represented about a quarter of the overall increase in SG&A.","As we said previously, we consider these marketing investments important to the long-term health of the brands as we seek to leverage the incredible brand awareness we have across our portfolio and transit it into top of mind purchase intent.","Regarding taxes, our first quarter effective tax rate was 39.9%, which includes a negative impact from the adoption of new stock-based compensation guidance. We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of about 39%.","Turning to earnings, first quarter earnings per share were $0.36. FX negatively impacted first quarter EPS by an estimated $0.03. Cash flow, our year-to-date cash flow was negative $5 million driven primarily by timing of lease payments and the increase in inventory from the end of the fiscal year.","As a reminder, we ended the first quarter with inventory about flat to last year. Free cash flow also includes approximately $14 million of insurance proceeds related to the fire at our Fishkill DC.","We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we completed about $100 million of share repurchases. Based on the strength of the current quarter, we now are planning to repurchase an additional $100 million of shares in the second quarter, consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders.","We ended the quarter with 396 million shares outstanding. Additionally, during the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million and currently have a dividend yield approaching 4%.","On inventory, we ended the first quarter with inventory about flat to last year. We now expect inventory to be about flat at the end of the second half recognizing this measure has some volatility given the magnitude of expected in transit particularly at Old Navy. While this is a point in time measure, it is important to note that we look at several metrics internally to ensure we are comfortable with the amount quality and productivity of our inventory.","With the strength of Old Navy, start to set an unit driven business, we are working on signing the right balance to support the business opportunity we see, while continuing to focus on inventory productivity and discipline.","Turning to capital, our year-to-date capital expenditures were $110 million excluding the cost associated with rebuilding of our Fishkill DC and related supply chain, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be about $625 million on the year. This is a reminder about half of this end will go towards store investments within remainder largely related to IT and supply chain to support out omni and digital strategies.","As we said previously, it's our priority to invest adequately while responsibly in the business to support long-term growth. We will continue to be prudent around these investments and adjust as needed depending in our performance and expected returns.","On store count year-to-date, we closed 14 company operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3186 stores. As we continue to refine our store plan, we now expect our store count to be about flat at the end of the year down from previous guidance of about 40 net new stores. We continue to be disciplined around opening new stores with a focus on wide space for Athleta and Old Navy.","Looking forward, as I have noted the current environment is unpredictable, while Q1 was volatile. We are cautiously optimistic given the strength we saw later in the quarter. Based on this we now expect, a mid-single digit decrease of first half earnings per share relative to adjusted EPS for the same period last year an improvement from our previous guidance of a high single-digit decrease.","For the full year, we continue to expect earnings per share for fiscal 2017, which includes the 53rd week to be in the range of 195 to 205. Included in our original and trend guidance is about $0.89 of insurance recovery for the fire at our Fishkill DC. This largely offset elevated logistics cost resulting from the fire. We expect to get about half of that in the second quarter. While we still expect the insurance recovery to fully offset elevated logistics cost, the timing of the recovery could have some variability both in the quarter and for the fiscal year.","For the full year, all of our other guidance metrics remain unchanged.","Thank you. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jen.","Jennifer Fall","Thanks Teri. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to questions. We'd appreciate limiting your questions to one per person.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first quarter from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. On the gross margin, can you speak to merchandise margin performance between the Gap brand the Old Navy in the first quarter? And then, just how best to think about the second quarter and the back half of the year?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. We are not going to get down to margin by brands but just going back to the overall. We were very pleased with the progress we saw in merch margin is, it's not just the numbers, but really when you look at the underlying health.","So, we had positive AUR on all of the brands and the merch margin is actually the highest expense, since I think around 2013 was the last time we were above the levels we are in the first quarter on a first quarter basis.","We had a higher percentage of sales at reg price, which is another healthy indicator and our marked down margin was actually improved as well. So, as we look across, we are very comfortable and pleased with the trends we are seeing in merch margins across the company and even within the brands.","As we look forward, due to a couple of things, one is obviously, that compares easier this quarter than we are going to see over the remainder of the year. And so while we continue to focus on the same basic elements in terms of driving the AUR, remaining disciplined on the AUC, really thinking through our promotional strategies to make sure we can continue the margin expansion. It's just a matter of combination of tougher comps as we move through the year and then the uncertainty of what's the macro environment may bring us.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then, just a follow-up at the GAP brand, can you just elaborate on the underlying signs of improvement by category that you are seeing. I guess what you think is the biggest second half opportunity. And just on large picture, how do you see the Gap concept differentiating itself longer term from the competition?","Arthur Peck","Yes, let me fill the time on that and again I don't want to appeal the whole business apart given the time that we have etcetera. So, let me focus a little bit on the differentiation, but what I'll say on what gives me confidence as you know that I always look at the women's first, business first and the women's first in North America. And I'm really pleased with the progress there. Again not perfect, but that's the hardest business and it often is a dull weather for the business and I'm pleased with what we're seeing there and again it's reflected in financial outcomes as Teri noted. If I think about what differentiates the Gap as a concept, I start with brand. And again we \u2013 I love the brands. I'm completely on objective about it where we do have objective data and the objective data that we measure how brand help to indicate the Gap's view as an iconic brand and a relevant brand.","We have work to do because obviously the business isn't performing up to that standard, but it's not the brand is that in anyway share performed and I go down more to the category level. We've got a fit business inside that business across the family that I think is a real opportunity to continue to drive growth. We have a latent body business and women's where we feel like particularly today with some of the fabrications and silhouettes that we have in the body business, super on trend with what she is looking for. Denim is always important and especially with innovation in denim across the entire family. I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing there and we have some early orders in the water where we bought small quantities of some technical and other innovation denim that are giving us some interesting indications, introduction of scope has been positively received.","And then again across our responsive capabilities, they are continuing to penetrate inside the business and where we have them upon running. We're seeing like graphics as an example where we have a super shot pipeline, it's all on demand buying right now. We're seeing very significant comps coming out of that sector and that's where we're also building approximate manufacturing capacity as well. So that we can put it on about \u2013 make it put on about be back in store and we're seeing excellent product performance there. So, again Gap's brand is relevant. It's always going to be a composite of the underlying categories and we feel like we continue to have differentiated opportunities in those categories.","Matthew Boss","Great. Congrats on a good nice quarter.","Arthur Peck","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the SG&A growth rate this quarter. Is this similar to what we should expect throughout the year as the marketing expense continues to grow?","Teri List-Stoll","Yes, that could be a little variability for the quarter but as I said it's really driven by couple of things, bonus, accruals and marketing and those will fall pretty radically throughout the year.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. Could you just talk a little bit more about the, a profitability on what you're seeing from a trend standpoint on margins for the various banners. And also if you can just give a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in Athleta \u2013 Athleta, it seems you're having a lot of success there.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. So in terms of the profitability, I go back to the gross margin commentary that we saw we are seeing positive AUR across the brands and we're seeing positive sales over traffic trends as well. These are indicators of increasing product acceptance across the brands and that obviously, then gives us the right starting point to be able to drive the growth of the business and the profitability of the business. So, now not going to as I said break it down brand-by-brand, but other than to say that I think we are learning a lot from the experience we had at the end of last year with the Fishkill Fire operating with leaner inventories maintain that discipline and driving the AUR throughout the year. Art, do you have anything to add?","Arthur Peck","No, I'll just jumping on the Athleta question and again I'm not going to go into specifics here but if you just look at the things at the fine Athleta, first of all, the active space and particularly the intersection of performance in lifestyle which is where Athleta is kind of uniquely positioned. It continues to be at above average growth segment for the market. In that space, many of our competitors are largely dependent upon wholesale. The wholesale buying calendar is much longer than we now have in many parts of the business. So especially in performance lifestyle, it allows us to be active \u2013 reactive to fashion trend which matters in that segment. It is an omni business. It has been from the get go and so we are seeing strong store performance and strong online performance and many customers who have in both of those and are most loyal customers. So, it's just the space that we're pleased with and we feel like the team is executing and the last thing is to be the voice that they have \u2013 the storytelling that they are doing, all based on the power of she and a very integrated message that we have there. We're just getting fantastic engagement and seeing fantastic loyalty. So, we're continuing to be bullish about the business and about the sector.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead. Once again, Paul Lejuez of Citi, your line is open. Please check your mute button. We are unable to hear you.","Paul Lejuez","Sorry, thanks. Can you talk about AUC during the quarter, if you could quantify that for us and also curious what sort of benefit you're already seeing from working with few vendors more deeply? How far along are you in that work and how do you expect that to impact where you see over the next couple of quarters and then to '18. Thanks.","Teri List-Stoll","Yes. So, we don't actually get down to the sea level while I did reference and I was talking about kind of what we look at in terms of profitability that we do focus on that and excluding effects of that \u2013 that we try to find that right balance between maintaining AUC, but also taking the right investments and the quality of the product and so it's part of a number of metrics we are constantly looking at to get the right balance of product and customer experience in the store.","Arthur Peck","On the vendor piece, I wouldn't say \u2013 not going to call out a quantified impact next quarter and the next quarter because really is a journey starts with fewer vendors that we do business more deeply with. It will manifest itself overtime in terms of our economics we believe that's the case. It also means that we can leverage vendor capabilities. We had as an example a continuing thing that we're doing is a denim summit when we invite our most important vendors in and we're very focused on making sure that we have sort of proactive engagement with innovation whereas in the past often times we were slow. We're now starting to see innovation that's coming at the fiber yard and fabric level right at the beginning or in fact earlier than others are and that will show up in terms of product innovation. We've pretty radically consolidated our debt vendor footprint over the last couple of years. But again this is a journey I've worked a lot in my past life where people were building a strategic vendor footprint and it's a multiyear journey where you get really tightly integrated with strategic relationships and where I would say really just scratching the surface of the potential impact broadly on business.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. Good luck guys.","Teri List-Stoll","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You talked a lot about obtaining market share, obviously we can all see the disruption that's out there, but are there particular segments of the market where you see the most ripe opportunity near-term and anything you're doing here from a marketing perspective or strategic inventory investments in any areas to really go aggressive after the opportunity. Thank you.","Arthur Peck","Yes, here's what I would say is given the sort of market case if you want to describe at that way and the announcement that seem to be coming out as pretty relentlessly. We feel like we got a pretty broad based opportunity. What I \u2013 so it's less about is it in denim or kids and baby or dresses or something like that. We feel we need to be prepared and it's a department store that's closing a store and a center that we do business in, that's obviously market share that's released across a whole bunch of different categories and so what reflects inside of what we're doing now is just really being very intentional about how we're competing for those customers. Some of that is really blocking and tackling which is being present in a center, making sure the customers are aware whether it's true center marketing, whether it's true putting leaflets under windshield wiper blades, really basic stuff that their customers are invited to come into our stores of course we're looking at things like honoring loyalty programs, outstanding coupon sort of the traditional mechanisms that were used, but that's really a competitor often times of center-by-center sort of situation.","At the higher level from a customer acquisition from a marketing standpoint etcetera, we're also really in the midway right now of what I would describe is being sort of competitively intentional on a way that we haven't done before. As we get an announcement of a block of closures or a whole chain folds itself up, we're doing the analysis kind of real-time to say where do we think we have an opportunity by brand and how we're going to go after that. So, this is \u2013 this isn't the future, but we do feel like there is an unprecedented amount of opportunity being made fluid right now and we want more than our fair share.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks for the color and best of luck.","Arthur Peck","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Once again, Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. We are unable to hear you. Please check the mute button.","Kimberly Greenberger","Sorry about that. I was on mute. Art, you talked about the confidence the foundational work you're doing is right foundational work and correct me if I heard this incorrectly, but it sounds like you're saying that the \u2013 the progress at Old Navy and Athleta are some of the evidence that the foundational work which is the right work. I'm wondering is it possible that the great results coming out of Old Navy and Athleta relate more to being positioned well in a value segment with an off-mall presence in the case of Old Navy and in the case of Athleta being positioned to well in the athletic apparel space which is sort of better space. And I'm just wondering how do you \u2013 how do you come to the conclusion that it's the foundational work that driving the results fair and not rather better positioning with consumers and more in line with consumer want and desire and how do you then draw the conclusion from that \u2013 that the foundational work is going to turnaround the results at Gap and Banana? Thanks so much.","Arthur Peck","Yes, right, I think it's a really good question. Just to be clear, we're fully cognizant in the fact that we may have some incremental tailwind for the reasons that you mentioned and others. That said, the traffic is the same \u2013 pretty much the same across strips and malls that we're seeing right now and so we can see \u2013 and I'm very much about \u2013 not about the averages frankly, but about the averaging those businesses and getting down into the business at the category level looking for consistent patterns across similar real-estate and those kinds of things. And so I will always be pretty relentlessly objective and try to disaggregate the fact that certainly value has some tailwind right now and the active sector has some tailwind. To be clear, bit part of Athleta's business is lifestyle rather than hard proactive and that's the business that we're competing in, in Banana and Gap as well.","So to say that there is probably a little bit of incremental tailwinds from some of that positioning is probably fair inside the business to see where we're winning and how we're winning is based upon capabilities that we haven't had in these businesses historically and \u2013 that in marketing again which to me is distinguishing that, and that's why we're putting our shoulder in those other businesses against storytelling component as well.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thanks, Art.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi, Art. I had a question as we think about millennials and generation Z, there is this movement also towards often to city and acceleration and thinking about on the increasing fragmentation it's happening in the marketplace. What your thoughts about how you'll prepare your company just to be well thought of by the younger generations and as you evolve the brand portfolio and the other thing we were just curious about is could you articulate the \u2013 your framework for thinking about the store base and just a strategic guardrails, as we do observe what's happening and there is lot of things that are going to happen in all of your control, which may affect you, whether that be specialty or department store closings and the rise of Amazon. Thank you.","Arthur Peck","That was a lot, bundled into that one sentence of all of our sales. I'll try to get some of it. Let's \u2013 let me go to your first statement, which is there are a lot of smaller companies to crap up various entry in terms of entering this business a pretty low. You've actually objectively looks fast and look at the doors that are being shattered etcetera. The reality is quantitatively the consolidation is taking place. So, it's perhaps fragmenting from the standpoint of the noise is out there, but consolidating as some of the share comes up and available and we've seen that happen in other geographies as well where the lead apparel companies in those geographies have been consolidating market share over the last several years. It is a big part of our thesis that because of our size and our scale or operating platform, a multiple brands targeted at different parts of the \u2013 different parts of the market that we have an opportunity to accelerate that share consolidation and that's not new news is what we've been executing against.","As to millennials, I might turn again that on its head which is there are lot of brands out there today against the backdrop of millennials wanting to engage with brands that have a story and have authenticity that, in fact, are entirely synthetic. When we do the research and we talk to customers and non-customers what we find is that when we tell the story, people are super engaged in the depth, the history, the legacy, the sustainability story that we have, many aspects of the story that we haven't told which is why I'm very big on really getting the holistic storytelling out there in front of customers and non-customers.","I've been spending a lot of time on this one because as I look at it now, I see the product work that we've done and the quality of the product that we have in our stores and I feel like our business is lagging, the product that we have in our stores and part of it is due to storytelling and as I've been meeting people, I am met consistently with the question of why aren't you guys telling the story, so, it's really high on my list right now and it doesn't mean, boom, boom, boom, a national TV campaign. We might use TV in some cases. It means really getting what is a rich, deep, authentic story in front of our customers and allowing them to engage on that. So I'm probably less concerned about that and actually will turn that less on liability than more of an asset that I think we have because of our brands and because of the relevance. Sorry, I was so enthralled with my own voice that I got into the second part. And that's just a two-part question, right, now two questions. The store base, the answer is really the same. However, that we've been telling you for a while which is we're going to be always on looking our store base, you say Teri indicated that we're bringing our net store increase down as a function of continuing to be prudent and trimming.","Again, the average is hide the true story which is we feel like we have a real-estate opportunity in front with us with Old Navy. I highlighted my comments opening in 8,000 square foot format for Old Navy with the very early returns being positive and 8,000 square feet opens up a bunch of infill opportunities that we feel can be highly productive, but again early days on that. On the more mature businesses with Banana and Gap, we've trimmed some stores, we've trimmed a lot of stores under my tenure out of the Gap brand and we will continue to do that. While at the same time like we are in Times Square and others, we'll selectively open stores if we feel like there is a place where we're not serving the market appropriately. And then you get to break the outlet freed out of that as well where as a new outlet center opens that continues to be a strong business for us. We'll embrace that and we've had some pretty good success like we have is an example on Fulton Street in Brooklyn or 125th Street in Harlem where we have opened factory stores out of the outlet locations and have seen those stores performed very, very well for us.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Art. That's it guys.","Arthur Peck","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks, good afternoon. Teri, can you put any color on the 2Q sales or margins implied within your first half EPS guide and then, sorry, if I missed it but have you saw the Athleta top-line opportunity at all, how large think the concept can grow? Thanks.","Teri List-Stoll","I feel like every question I get asked I start by saying I'm not going to tell you that. I'm not going to tell you that.","Arthur Peck","Just don't get frustrated, Teri. We'll work something out, okay?","Teri List-Stoll","But the only guidance with our new conviction with the guidance we provided on EPS for the first half and inventory for the first half. And then for the full year, we said we expect the comps to be flat to up slightly and we're holding to that at this stage given have feel good about the first quarter but that's early days and we need to see what plays out throughout the year?","Arthur Peck","And on sizing Athleta, we haven't sized it, so you didn't miss it. What I would say as I see a very long runway of growth in front of us, part of it is store count, part of it is just continuing overall to be an attractive segment of the market that is growing faster than the whole. And frankly part of it is the fact that Athleta business is not insignificantly really in the core of lifestyle and ready-to-wear despite the fact that every piece of clothing in an Athleta store has some aspect of performance associated with it. So it is a differentiated innovative offer that has a very large market that it can tap into really into the whole of her closet. So, we're very bullish on the growth opportunity in front of us.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. Thanks. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon. Congratulations on the improvement particularly in the margin. Art, my question is on e-com, I know it's near and dear to your heart having led GID. And I'm wondering you have one of the lower penetrations in that piece of the business relative to some of your competition. I'm wondering if you can talk about kind of where you think that could go and incorporating sort of big data and an analysis to drive e-com and personalization. Thank you very much.","Arthur Peck","Yes. I'm actually pretty pleased with our penetration to be honest and feel like we continue to have a market share opportunity there. It varies pretty widely across the brands as you might expect. Old Navy has a very significant penetration of millennial customers that are engaged in that brand. We had Old Navy has the highest penetration of cash customers, which obviously, precludes online sales. So I'm -- I'm pleased with what we are and I think we continue to see a significant opportunity in front of us. And I sort of think about our digital business, our digital store in the same way I think about our physical stores in terms of everyday there is an opportunity to improve the quality of execution whether it's page load times, whether it's navigation, whether it's personalization, which as you know we have continued to put energy and effort again and where we even modestly personalized the experience we see positive engagement from the customers and the financial metrics all moving the right direction.","Data and analytics is very much on my mind right now hitting number of areas of the business, not the least of which is certainly in e-com and you may have noted that just about a year ago we brought in somebody whose significant part of the responsibilities is to really pull all the data that we have about our customers across the physical experience and the digital experience, the card program etcetera together in a way to really provide that foundation for continuing to advance personalization going forward. So, it's certainly an opportunity that we have, I believe data analytics and AI are going to continue to play an increasing role, but it's out in the future right now and right now we have a lot \u2013 we have a lot of opportunity just by executing against the basics, but certainly in our future that will continue to see incremental opportunity there.","Adrienne Yih","Great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great, thanks. Good evening everyone. I wanted to ask on stores, are you talked about how you've closed the number of stores in the past, what can you tell us about sales transfer first of all. Second, can you talk about how your performance was in the quarter in a stores that were in close proximity to some department stores that closed and also I noticed that you changed your -- or you mentioned that store target for the year, what was the driver of that change? Thanks.","Arthur Peck","Yes. So, on -- I'm sorry, what was the first?","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Sales transfer.","Arthur Peck","Sales transfer, yes, we've talked about this before Lindsay, I'd love to tell you that we've closed the store and magically that moves into a nearby location at online and etcetera in our other brands. It isn't that easy. We worked really, really hard when we closed the store to transfer those customers whether it's into the Gap store into a Gap factory store to an Old Navy in the online business, but it isn't nearly as high as I'd like to be, and it represents \u2013 continues to represent an opportunity. And we do the basic things that you would recommend, push extra hard as we're closing a store to get our customers in that store up on our card program, e-mail capture, all those kinds of things. But I generally believe that when you close the store in the short-term, you probably giving up some market share and we've been I think pretty clear about that historically.","On the store guidance, we pushed \u2013 we push some openings out and then we had some additional closures in Gap and BR. There is no drama inside of that at all as opposed to the fact that I think we've demonstrated and we'll continue to demonstrate that we're pretty relentless about grinding away and tuning and tweaking the number of store locations that we have and we're going to continue to do that. It was something that that Sabrina was very passionate about and I know Teri and I continue to share exactly that same passion.","And again, it's on both sides of the equation right now. We're going to get out of stores that we don't feel the brands belong in or we feel like there is an economic issue, and then, we're going to open locations where we believe we have a selective opportunity to increase market share at the same time. And so what I don't want to do is imply that somehow, there was a strategic implication to the adjustment. It's really just a matter of course of business that we made that adjustment and communicated it right now.","Teri List-Stoll","I guess, the only thing I would add to that is when you think about those changes. We have largely held our capital budget -- our capital spending guidance and that's because we are allocating some funding to remodels. One of the things Art talked about is the customer experience is very important and stores remained important to those customers and frankly we had gotten a little behind in some places. And so we're doing a very thoughtful job of going through our inventory of stores and making sure that they live up to the brand statement that we want to make to our customers and so, it's certainly nothing crazy, but a very intentional decision to continue to invest in our stores.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","And just on -- thank you, and just on how the stores that you have in close proximity to a competitor that closes or to a big department store that closes how those performed relative to the balance of fleet.","Arthur Peck","Yes. I would say that pick any answer you want quite honestly. There is some stores -- well, some stores will close and you're looking to say okay, there is no overlap to our business because of the segment that they serve. Some stores will close and you suck the life out of a center if it's a major department store. But lot of the stores that are closing just to be clear, the closing for a reason. And it's not like they were necessarily the strong horse pulling the cart in these places.","So, our view is very simple about this. That when a store closes, there is a certain number of jeans, pairs of jeans and denim and onesies et cetera, et cetera that aren't going to out the door of that store. And to the extent that we plan those categories and then our brands are positioned relevantly from the standpoint of quality and price that is market share that is now in play. And we intend to compete very intentionally across all of our brands and all of our channels to get more than our fair share. But there isn't a simple easy answer because it's such a mixed bag right now of who's shuttering a store, who is going out of business that some of it is highly relevant and some of it is pretty orthogonal to our brands and how they're positioned.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thank you.","Jennifer Fall","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder, the press release which is available on gapinc.com contains the full recap of our first quarter results as well as the forward-looking guidance included in our prepared remarks. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference. You may now disconnect."]}}
