All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2015 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted funds from operations and funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in-charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you Lisa, and good morning to all of you. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. And special thanks to those of you who joined us a few weeks ago at our Investor Day in Philadelphia. As we reported then, the Apartment business is quite good. Our third quarter results confirm that we are on track in our execution of the long-term and explicit strategies that we\u2019ve discussed before and that we\u2019ve reviewed in detail well together in Philadelphia.","Before my colleagues report on the particulars of the third quarter, I\u2019d like to point out a few highlights. In property operations rent growth during the third quarter leasing season continue to be strong and in fact accelerated over the prior year. Setting us up for a strong close to 2015 and an excellent foundation for next year. Keith and his team continued to keep a close eye on operating expenses, which were up by less than 2% year-over-year. In redevelopment as we discussed in detail at our Investor Day, ongoing redevelopments are on time, on budget and expected to create value equal to $0.32 for every dollar invested.","Patti and her team achieved several milestones in third quarter. Here are three. Our redevelopment at Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera, California reached 97% occupancy. Our redevelopment at Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California enjoyed another quarter of 20% plus rent increases. And third, based on success at Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia in redevelopment of the south tower, we have now begun the redevelopment of the east tower.","Next, in portfolio management third quarter revenue per apartment home was more than $1,800 a month, up 10% year-over-year. The rate of increase reflects market rent growth but owes even more to our long-term discipline of making pair trades where we sell lower rated properties to fund the purchase or redevelopment of properties with better locations, higher rents, greater expected rent growth and higher projected free cash flow internal rates return.","I\u2019d like to take a minute to discuss our commitment to buy a Northern California property that was reported in our third quarter release. I acknowledge that the seller\u2019s requirement of confidentiality makes it difficult for you to review, what I can\u2019t say is that this acquisition is exactly consistent with our longstanding pair trade discipline.","The Bay Area is a market where we have long said that we are under allocated and looking for opportunities for further investment. The property we\u2019ve agreed to buy is well located and at a high quality. We expected to be attractive to the high income consumer that we had explicitly targeted and that is market rents will be more than $3,800 a month.","While we do not consider the price a distress price, we do believe that it is an attractive price due to our willingness to make a commitment prior to completion just as we did at Vivo in Cambridge and to accept lease-up risk. We project a free cash flow internal rate of return of 7.91% which we think incorporates an appropriate risk premium considering that we have no entitlement risk and no construction risk.","Our underwriting was consistent with our explicit discipline using the average of market forecasters, long-term rent growth and conservative operating expenses. We project an NOI yield of stabilization of 4.88% assuming average rent growth after closing of 3.6% for the remainder of our 10-year model. We think that stabilized assets of this quality priced today at NOI cap rates well below 4%, and this creates value creation of $100 million at stabilization unlevered.","In particular, our investment decision is neutral about the apartment market in general because we\u2019re buying and selling at the same time using exactly the same methodology. Of course the paired-trade will be leveraged neutral.","The equity component will be funded by sale of two properties. One that is 42 years old and one that is 17 years old, located in slower growing markets with average revenue under $1,500 a month and expected free cash flow internal rates of return of 6% if we were to hold them for the same 10-year period.","We\u2019re confident that shareholders will prefer our acquisition property to our disposition properties, because the paired-trade improves our real estate quality, our portfolio allocation of the Bay Area, our free cash flow and our growth rate. Let me also address three other specific questions that I\u2019ve been asked this morning.","First, this acquisition has been moving through our underwriting and documentation process since early last summer. Second, our view in Northern California is that it is volatile, a point that we explicitly made at our Investor Day. We also believe that they\u2019re slow sometime from its recent remarkable growth rate. That said, the Northern California economy is perhaps the most dynamic in the world and rent growth there continuous to be the best in the country.","While we\u2019re by no means making a call on Northern California rent growth, we underwrote the proposed acquisition assuming rent growth no better than the long-term compounded annual growth rate of 3.6%, which is markedly lower number than recent rate of growth. Third, the disposition properties have been in the market and are in various stages of documentation and closing.","Next, on the balance sheet, we continue to prioritize safety, liquidity and flexibility. We expect leverage will continue to decline and project our coverage ratios will improve even further as redevelopment and acquisition properties are leased up.","Most importantly, the Aimco team is cohesive and focused on the collaborative execution of our plans that emphasize customer satisfaction, cost control and value creation to redevelopment. For these good results offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver as well as across the country to privilege and a pleasure to work with you.","And now for more detailed report on third quarter operations I would like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I am pleased to report that we had a solid quarter in operations with revenues up 4.3% year-over-year. Expenses were up 1.9 year-over-year, with NOI up 5.4% for the quarter, all an improvement over third quarter 2014.","Our residents continue to increase our marks in customer satisfaction. They give us better than a four-star rating for the quarter and we continue to see improvement year-over-year. As a result, renewal rent increased 6% for the quarter, some 40 basis points higher than third quarter 2014. These results were progressively better in each subsequent month of the quarter. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Atlanta. Renewal rents in these markets increased 7% to 11% compared to expiring leases.","For those leases expired and we\u2019re not renewed, our new lease pricing accelerated during the final months of leasing season, peaking at 7.7% in August. Each individual month in the quarter, outperformed the same month from 2014. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates at 6.6%, 20 basis points better than prior year.","New lease rates were particularly strong in Denver, Seattle, Austin and Los Angeles with increases between 11% and 15%. As good as those numbers are, the Bay Area had the single greatest result, new lease premiums at 19%. As a result of our teams hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increase 6.3% for the quarter, 30 basis points better than Q3 2014.","Turnover for the quarter was 46.7%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. Of the customers who decided to move out 22% were for career moves, 21% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.","Our resident quality continues to improve. The average income of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was $142,000 with the median income of $95,000. Year-over-year the median income of our new residents was up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2014, due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality.","As mapped out at Aimco\u2019s Investor Day, our 12 target markets which represent 19% of same-store NOI, had top-line revenue growth up 4.5% in Q3. The top performance had revenue increases from nearly 6% to 10% for the quarter. This was led by the bay area followed by Seattle, Denver, New York and San Diego. Our steady performers which had revenue growth of 3.5% to better than 5% were Boston, Greater Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami.","And finally, with revenue growth of almost 2% to nearly 3% we round out our target markets with Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington DC. As we start the fourth quarter, the acceleration continues on trend with October results better than last year.","Blended lease rates are up 4.6%, 19 basis points ahead of October 2014, with new leases up 3.6% and renewals up 5.7%. October\u2019s average daily occupancy with 95.4%, in November and December renewal offers went out with 5% to 7% increases and with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco\u2019s success.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. During the third quarter, we invested a total of $70 million in our portfolio through redevelopment and development activities. We invested in properties located in Boston, Cambridge, Center City, Philadelphia and La Jolla, California. We expect from these investments stabilized average revenues per apartment home of more than $3,000 continuing the substantial improvement in our portfolio.","Breaking down these activities, we invested $30 million in redevelopment during the quarter, most of the [indiscernible] paced in the Sterling both located in Center City, Philadelphia. Many of you have the opportunity to see these communities during our Investor Day last month. As we discussed then, we are executing both of these redevelopments in phases, providing us with the flexibility to just as we go depending on product acceptance and competing supply.","We\u2019re having good success of both communities, with absorption on phase with our plan and rents above our underwriting. Through October we\u2019ve completed a 180 of the apartment homes in the South Tower of Park Towne place, and 83% released. Rents and the lease departments are ahead of our underwriting cost in construction deliveries are on plan and we expect to complete redevelopment of the south tower and the amenities in the first quarter of 2016. With these positive results to date, and to approved the plan during the third quarter to redevelop the East Tower of Park Towne place for an additional net investment of $37 million.","During construction, we plan to combine some apartment homes in this building, so that the tower at completion will include 245 apartment homes. In order to facilitate the extensive construction activity, we began de-leasing the east tower last month. At the end of October, 91% of the 216 completed apartment homes at the Sterling released, again at rents on those lease departments above underwriting. In October, we completed construction on time, and on budget at our Ocean House on Prospect Community in Ohio, California. 41 of the 53 apartment\u2019s homes at this community are leased with rental rate achievement above underwriting. Overall our redevelopments are enjoying good lease space and achieving rents at or above expectations.","During the quarter, we also invested $40 million in two developments, one in Cambridge and one in Boston. At our Cambridge community Vivo, which we acquired with construction in progress last quarter, construction of the apartment homes is now complete and we started to lease up in October. Early activity has been promising. At our One Canal development in Boston, construction is proceeding well, we have commenced our pre-leasing activity there and look forward to first occupancy early next year.","As we\u2019ve discussed at our Investor Day, Aimco has made significant upgrades to its portfolio over the last few years through a series of pair trades. This quarter we did not complete any sales or an acquisitions, the date as Terry mentioned and are into a contract to require an under construction community in Northern California for $320 million. We anticipate this acquisition will close upon the completion of construction next summer.","This acquisition which will increase by a third on investment in the Bay Area, will be executed with the same pair trade business when we\u2019ve undertaken with our previous transactions. Our portion of the acquisition price will be funded through a leverage neutral property loan, with the equity portion funded primarily with proceeds from the sale of the 17 year old Phoenix asset that is scheduled to close this quarter and a 42 year old asset in Alexandria, Virginia, where we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2016.","These properties have average revenues per unit of $1,459, and the negotiated pricing represents an average NOI cap rate of 4.95%. While the seller has specifically precluded that from disclosing property specific information around the acquisition, Terry has provided some of the key assumptions around our underwriting of it.","We believe our underwriting reflects appropriately conservative assumptions for the future of this property, and at the pair trade provides a clear opportunity to move investment dollars from ageing properties with lower long-term prospects to one with the much brighter future. And I might add, we look forward today, when we cannot only identify the property, may give you the opportunity to see it, we believe, you\u2019ll agree that it is a great trade and a positive add to our portfolio.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, John. Starting with third quarter 2015 results, AFFO $0.48 per share with a penny ahead of the high-end of our guidance range. And FFO of $0.57 per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.01. The primary driver of FFO outperformance was stronger than expected conventional operating results including same-store net operating income growth of 40 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range.","At the AFFO line, the $0.03 outperformance was driven by the $0.01 FFO outperformance and $0.02 due to the timing capital spend, which is now expected to be incurred during the fourth quarter. On the balance sheet, we continue to focus on reducing the amount of our leverage as well as of cost. Our target is to maintain total leverage to EBITDA at a level below 7.0 times.","For the third quarter, leverage was 7.1 times. Leverage was elevated above target at quarter end due to the timing of planned property sales. At year\u2019s end, we expect total leverage to EBITDA to be 6.8 times. The property debt market remains deep and liquid with the best rates being offered by life companies, savings banks, and community banks. While we did not close any property loans during the third quarter, we did close two non-recourse fixed rate loans related to our Mezzo community in Atlanta and Chestnut Hall community in Philadelphia.","These loans totaling $64 million at senior terms of weighted interest rate of 3.73% and a 30-year amortization period. Also included the flexible step-down prepayment penalty during the last five years at 1% and a 60-day opt out at the end of year seven with no prepayment penalty.","In addition, we [indiscernible] a property loan on our second quarter acquisition in Cambridge, Axiom, this $35 million 10 year fixed rate non-recourse loan also with a 30 year amortization period which rate loss at 3.7%. Finally on the balance sheet, we are also closed to finalizing the debt terms on the Northern California property acquisition. We expect the loan to price similarly to the three loans I just described as adjusted by changes in treasury rates.","Patti and her team are doing an excellent job, managing our property debt activities and keeping our cost down. For the third consecutive quarter after midpoint, we are raising pro forma FFO, AFFO and conventional same-store sale NOI growth guidance. We had increased the full-year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance to take into account our third quarter outperformance. We have established fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.56 to $0.60 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.47 to $0.51 per share. So our conventional same store operations for the year, we expect revenue growth of 4.4% to 4.6%, expense growth of 2.1% to 2.3% resulting in full year NOI growth of 5.4% to 5.8%.","For the fourth quarter, we are projecting NOI to increase 4% to 4.5% compared to fourth quarter of last year and to increase 2.5% to 3.0% sequentially. We will provide full 2016 guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings call. Once we\u2019ve completed our budget progress. However, [indiscernible] preview we do expect 2016 same store revenue growth to be on part with if not slightly better than 2015, which is shaping up to be a very good year. I look forward to sharing the details of our guidance with you in February.","Before we take question I\u2019d like to point out the change we\u2019ve made in our report in this quarter. Specifically, we have confirmed the market level disclosures and our reporting of same store and total conventional portfolio metrics on our supplemental schedule six and seven to be consistent with our presentation of the 12 target markets at our Investor Day last month. You\u2019ll find additional information on the schedules describing the changes in more detail.","With that we will now open up the call for question. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I\u2019ll turn over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","Thank you. This question is for Keith. I was curious if you could comment on other revenues and fees like parking storage packs in the quarter as the same store revenue looked a little late considering the blended lease rate you\u2019ve been achieving for the past year and a half?","Paul Beldin","Sure Jana, this is Paul, I\u2019ll start with that and then kick it over to Keith for some of the more particulars. What I would say in regards to other revenues that it grew about 2.8% for the quarter, which was lower than our overall rental rate growth and that was really in line with our expectations. As far as the major components, our utility reimbursements increased slightly by only 3% at our past history, that growth rate in prior years had been much higher, but this year it\u2019s inline with our expectations. And fee income grew about 5%. Keith you want to add some color on any other particulars there?","Keith Kimmel","Paul and Jana I would just add that while there has been a little bit of a deceleration from where we were a year ago that we still see opportunities, as we\u2019ve been putting some very particular focus on parking and storage and a variety of other components within the communities that we are able to present a special opportunities for our residents to have a unique living experience.","Jana Galan","Thank you. And then maybe just on the Washington DC, your portfolio was one of the best performers among peers for the third quarter I was wondering if you could just comment on any trends you saw in DC?","Keith Kimmel","Sure, Jana. This is Keith I will take it. We\u2019re definitely is doing better than we have in some quite \u2013 quite some time as we think about DC. For us really two different markets Suburban Maryland and Suburban Virginia is where we\u2019re located, Suburban Maryland has been the out-performer in the two as we look at Suburban Virginia particularly in Alexandria there is still some more supply to be absorbed, but as we think about it, we would say that we\u2019re seeing acceleration, we\u2019re optimistic about it, and as we look into 2016 we think that it\u2019s on part if not better going forward.","Jana Galan","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Did I hear correctly that both the cap rate on the Northern California deal and the expected pair trade sales were both about 4.9%?","John Bezzant","Yes, this is John, Nick. Yes you\u2019re correct, we anticipate to stabilize on the acquisition which is about 4.88% and on sales were at 4.95%.","Nick Joseph","And there is both forward NOI cap rate?","John Bezzant","Those are NOI cap rate, correct.","Nick Joseph","Okay. I think you mentioned that Northern California has been historically volatile, so I\u2019d like to get your thoughts on adding exposure to that region at this point in the cycle both from an operations as well as in asset pricing perspective just keeping how strong that market has been?","John Bezzant","Sure, I think two things, one obviously we have talked about the volatility of that market and we talked about it recently is a month ago with everybody in Philadelphia. That said we also look ahead as a good solid absolute growth market long-term, and so it\u2019s one where we want to have a presence, we want to have a presence in high quality product; we want to be in high quality sub markets. And so as we look at the pair trade coming out of lower quality product and lower quality sub markets.","We feel good about the long-term investment decision and we in our underwriting are looking at a 10 year model, so you get some of the benefit of, if you will to smoothing the volatility through that 10 years. As Terry noted in his remarks, our underwriting does not assume, we have to have double-digit rate growth for an extended period of time for any period of time during that 10 year hold on that acquisition asset we are using the rent growth rates that are provided by recent AxiaMetrics who are looking at supply, who are looking at job growth, who are looking at all of the econometric trends in that sub market and put out of prediction for what revenue growth will be there.","And tell you that the five years, four years immediately following acquisition when the construction is complete next year that growth rate is in the low threes. And so we don\u2019t feel like it's out on a limb to consider that over an extended period of time at five or ten year window, you\u2019d see revenue growth in that market in the threes.","Nick Joseph","And what does that [indiscernible] assumed for extra cap rate?","John Bezzant","I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but I believe it's a five, but I don\u2019t have it right in front of me right now I apologize and if I can\u2019t get to you later if you like it.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, and just last question appreciate the 2016 same-store revenue growth comments. What\u2019s the last release for the portfolio today?","Paul Beldin","And Nick this is Paul, our last release currently is a bit below 8% about 7.5% range and one comment that to clarify that as we look at last release we measured that with our in book based on business and that particular point in time compared to market rates. So there is volatility to that depending upon where you are within the leasing season. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have a question from Nick Yulico of UBS. ","Nick Yulico","Thanks. For the Northern California acquisition the Bay Area is one that you about. Just opening on may be two or four how many units, they\u2019re in the project and may be a little bit more about where it is within the Bay Area, I\u2019m assuming its probably not in San Francisco itself. ","Terry Considine","Yes, Nick I will tell you definitively it is not in the city of San Francisco. Unfortunately unit count and some of the other specific identifying factors, the seller has asked us very specifically not to disclose those. They have other projects in the area, other things going on that between contractor relationships, city relationships and other things they\u2019ve been asked us to be sensitive to their request that we not provide, identifying indicators on the property. ","I\u2019d love to be able to tell you what it is, but we can\u2019t. ","Nick Yulico","Okay and then Terry, I mean just going back to this acquisition, and so how you and the board is thinking about the company. This is the largest acquisition you guys have done, it looks like since you bought [indiscernible] in back in 2002, which is an entire portfolio. This is a single asset you\u2019re buying, it\u2019s about 3% to 4% of your enterprise value, I get that you\u2019re switching out deals and buying new. Yes, the earnings impact your scenes pretty minimal, maybe it\u2019s even dilutive in the near-term to your FFO and we can debate AFFO. But I\u2019m sure, why this makes sense this trade, why not to sell assets and buyback your stock or pay a special dividend and how did you guys think about the whole process? ","Terry Considine","Nick, thank you for the question, first of all we \u2013 the Board and I and the management team have thought about that. And you think about that, and I\u2019m just saying exactly how we do with, it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve described hope that Investor Day and in numerable meetings over the last several years that we are first of all focused on upgrading our portfolio to serve customers with better jobs, better incomes and better growth prospects. And we think that\u2019s what drives long-term portfolio quality and you can see that in the numbers that Keith reported in his remarks that today we\u2019re at medium rent of almost $100,000 which is astonishing to me. And we\u2019re at average rents today of about $1,800 which again is a market change.","So the Board and I focused first on I\u2019m trying to improve the quality of our customer and the quality of our real estate. With that, we have also rethink in according to the third-party forecaster significantly improved the growth rate of revenue and also expected free cash flow internal rates of return. And I think, speaking for the board, I think we feel that John has done a wonderful job in leading that effort and at a point it\u2019s not particularly by buying the market that is simplicity, as to what John has done, what he has done instead he has defined particular circumstances, generally where the seller has some unusual need that makes it just a little bit less liquid, a little bit less efficient then would be a true in a poorly marketed deal.","And so, and the issue handed [ph] that we are prepare to commit during construction, just as we did at Vivo in Kendall Square and that we\u2019re prepared to underwrite the lease or risk. In return for that, we get a little bit of breaking in pricing. So the Board thinks that when all are setting done that and what we\u2019ve already achieved is a very significantly improved portfolio with higher quality customers, higher average rents, higher expected growth, higher expected free cash flow, internal rates of return. I\u2019d note that the effective of this trade is to increase our California exposure to just under 40% which is about where we like it and our Bay Area exposure to about 12%. And so again those are allocations that we\u2019ve described to the market before and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any surprise. People are thinking that that\u2019s just what we wanted to do.","The question about special dividends and stock buybacks, I\u2019d like to speak too. First of all, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve done in the past. We paid special dividends and we paid and we made stock buybacks. We\u2019re familiar with both of those. And we discussed it at length, both on the board and also with shareholders and we have a lot of occasion to meet with our shareholders and ask them their opinion. And as you know, if you ask two people their opinions you\u2019ll get three answers. So there\u2019s not newly limited, but the broad consensus of our shareholders and our board is that we\u2019re employed to own and operate in development apart with properties. And they want us to focus on that and not on trying to time the market. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks for that Terry. And just one last question, Paul do you mind just maybe giving us a bit of a preview of how to think about your tax credit income as you\u2019re heading into next year since \u2013 I know you have some of that burning off and it\u2019s\u2019 \u2013 it can be a bit of a volatile impact on your FFO perhaps next year. Thank you.","Paul Beldin","You bet, Nick. As it relates to our tax credit agreements, you pointed that there is certainly some volatility to it. And during 2015, we\u2019ve been relating, recognizing income related to our Park Towne\u2019s place projects. And as we have looked at the second phase when we\u2019re moving onto the next tower, we\u2019ll earn some additional credits next year related to that, but the number is somewhat still in lots, but the amount will roughly probably be between $8 million and $10 million or so. And so, as we start spending actual dollars on that, that is when we\u2019ll start to be able to get better definition around the exact timing of recognition pattern, but if you think about it for the full year of 2016, it will be in that range.","Nick Yulico","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And the next question is from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler","Hi, it\u2019s Jordan Sadler here with Austin \u2013 excuse me. First, I guess, just following up on California sort of beat a dead horse here, is there a way that you can kind of describe the nature of the seller or the exiting capital if you will without giving too much away?","John Bezzant","Sure, this is John. The seller is a developer \u2013 an active developer in multiple markets around the country. They raise development equity for their deals, some deals they retain and holding their own portfolio, others, they flip out and sell similar to a merchant builder type of a situation. This happened to be a situation where it is a group that we\u2019ve done business within the past and they had an opportunity here where they had a capital partner that was ready to get out of the deal upon completion of construction and we were able to start the deal.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. And then\u2026","John Bezzant","That answer the question?","Jordan Sadler","Yes, that\u2019s pretty good actually.","John Bezzant","All right.","Jordan Sadler","And then as it relates to the IRR that we talked about, is there in your rent growth assumption because you\u2019ve talked about the volatility in California and it\u2019s tremendously unpredictable, this is quite a strong upturn. You are taking possession in presumably nine months. Once you take possession you said there\u2019s a low 3% number over the following four months \u2013 four years that you\u2019re assuming in terms of rent growth. Is there a meaningful downturn embedded in that?","John Bezzant","No, but let me explain it to you why. So, if you look at the third-party data provider, again as I said earlier we use recent axiom metrics. They rarely forecast a downturn, a negative growth number. They also rarely forecast double-digit growth, [02:41] [indiscernible] ever forecast double-digit growth.","And so if you were to go back and look at the last three or four years in that submarkets in the Bay Area as a whole, I don\u2019t think it was ever a year where they forecasted double-digit rent growth particularly out two or three years in front of it. What general happens with their revenue projections is a tail off and they revert to [indiscernible] of around 3.5% over a period of time. And that is the pattern that we see there. So if I were to take the submarket growth rates for the submarket where there is property is located, it drops into the low threes for the five year period from today that they forecast out, that\u2019s below 3.5%.","The long-term growth rate which is a 20 year growth rate of actual growth in that submarket for the last 20 years is 3.77%. And so, our average over the \u2013 our model starts now, started back in the summer when we underwrote and did the property. So the first year out \u2013 is effectively run before we buy the property. So there is nine years left in the model, that\u2019s where that 361 that we talked about earlier comes in, it\u2019s an average rate through the life of that remaining nine years of the model.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess in your experience and ours, if you look back over the last 15 years, there have been higher \u2013 high peaks and low values in suburban or San Francisco or the Bay Area apartments and I was thinking \u2013 downturns could probably be more severe just to peak to have been higher.","John Bezzant","Yes, absolutely right, you are absolutely right that there are high peaks and low valleys in that submarket, in Bay Area in general. And you can look back at the .com bus, you can look back to big swing, double-digit swings and that\u2019s a 20 year growth rate for that market, just move some of that out and just want to remind everybody that we are underwriting for a long-term portfolio of \u2013 that we are looking at a long-term allocation, a long-term commitment for good submarket with a high 377, 20 year growth rate. That takes into account, both of those dips that we talk about, but also both of the obstructs that we looked during the last 15 years out there.","Jordan Sadler","That\u2019s helpful. The last 4.5 years, 4 years, just from an accounting or earning perspective, when this comes online, it sounds like \u2013 it\u2019s a suburban property, but not high rise, but how would this should come online economically, I mean is it $320 million and a 0 NOI effectively or will there be some capitalization allowed, just trying to figure out?","John Bezzant","As soon as that comes in, $320 million next summer, [indiscernible] earns in quickly, obviously we will do pre leasing, we will \u2013 we have rights under the agreement to begin pre-leasing early next year and we would hope to ask some pre-leasing done when the building is turned over to us, but it will be turned over to us in whole and so move ins would commence after completion of construction, but it would be an old building.","Jordan Sadler","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Rob Stevenson of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon guys. Keith can you talk about, when you\u2019re sitting here today, what markets do you feel like that there are likely to be stronger in the next 12 months than they\u2019ve been over the last 12 months, in terms of rental rate growth?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, it\u2019s Keith. Let me walk through it. As we looked around the country, I would point to [indiscernible] we\u2019ve seen some very strong acceleration this year a little better than we had anticipated and we think that that could continue. I would look to the Bay Areas and other opportunity it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s when we talk about in my prepared remarks 19% on the new lease side this past quarter, it\u2019s continue to show acceleration. And I would also point to Los Angeles is an opportunity.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then, when I look at the year-to-date expense growth is 14, the guidance at the mid-point is 22 on the same-store side. How much pressure are you seeing into the back half of this year on real estate taxes in personnel and other sort of major bucket to the expense load that\u2019s likely to push 2016 same-store expense up into the 3, 3.5 range. When you thinking on it.","Paul Beldin","Hi, Rob, this is Paul. I\u2019ll start off by commenting on the fourth quarter impact, you\u2019re correct, and noticing that our year-to-date expense control is quite good and our implied guidance indicates a fairly significant expense growth here in Q4. And that\u2019s really being driven by two items that we\u2019re actually benefits to our expense numbers in 2014.","Last year in the fourth quarter we had a favorable tax appeal that significantly reduced real estate taxes in the quarter. And then we also have some adjustments to our loss reserves related to our insurance activities that reduced our insurance costs on a year-over-year in Q4 of 2014. So, I you were to normalize for those two factors, our expected expense growth rather than the 4% or so that\u2019s implied in our guidance would actually be closer to 2% versus in line with what we\u2019ve seen so far this year.","And then as it relates to 2016, as we\u2019re still on to the planning process, we\u2019re working to the detail property budgets, we\u2019re not prepared to give any sort of indicative range or percentage or like at this point. But I will assure you that we\u2019ll continue to do our best through control expenses and to continue to lead the pathway comes that regard.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. I mean, is that\u2026","Paul Beldin","Rob I...","Unidentified Analyst","Sorry.","Paul Beldin","Rob, I just curious is going to add specifically it\u2019s the taxes, you\u2019ll recall I would mentioned that our allocation to California, we just under 40%. And so, in that important part of our portfolio will be kept at the lesser of CBI are 2%.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then what is the \u2013 in the 2015 guidance, what is the, you\u2019ll remind us what the same-store, what the \u2013 in the same-store guidance what the increase in real estate taxes and personnel costs are computed in that sort of to full year guidance?","Paul Beldin","Yes, within that full year guidance that would imply year-over-year real estate tax increase of 4% range.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then on Personnel.","Paul Beldin","Personnel, I don\u2019t have\u2026","Terry Considine","I\u2019m sorry about that. Rob, do you think we are comparing those, we don\u2019t have that in front of us, we can give you call back to close little bit down that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, guys, thanks appreciate it.","Operator","And the next question is from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] here with Dan Oppenheim, we just had a few questions here in terms of leasing activity what were new leases and renewals achieved in October, and what you went out for new renewals in November and December?","Keith Kimmel","Dan this is Keith, I\u2019ll take it, new leases in October went out at 3.6, renewals were 5.7 for a blend of 4.6 and I just point out that was 90 basis points better than we were a year ago. And the renewals went out at 5% to 7% for November, December.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks. And in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in Miami it seems revenue was a little light there compared to the rest of the target markets. Can you just speak through what you\u2019re seeing there?","Keith Kimmel","Yeah, Keith, I will take that one. What were seeing in Miami is that there is a new supply that\u2019s next to one of our buildings, that\u2019s in the process of lease up and it\u2019s put a little pressure on that community and so that\u2019s really what the difference is. But as we look at it, where our community is located in South Beach in the Brickell Area we think they are best located communities in Miami and it\u2019s just a blip as they\u2019re getting to it.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital.","John Kim","Thank you. Diversification has been a major part of your strategy, but when you\u2019re spending your capital is unquestionably the higher end product California centric, are you still married to your diversification strategy of the point, and does that makes sense to exit markets more aggressively at this point in cycle?","Terry Considine","What is the last part of that John?","John Kim","Does that make more sense to take the market like some of your competitors have done?","Terry Considine","Well. John, this is Terry and I don\u2019t want to necessarily speak to our competitors, but we have a unchanged commitment to being both diversified both by price point and by geographic market. And in pursue of that, as I mentioned earlier we\u2019ve targeted higher income customers and we have had exceeded a great many markets. And today are focused on 12, which you\u2019ll recall that we discussed that some length at Investor day, and we continue to look for a balance among those 12, we said that for a long period time that we would like to be allocated roughly in proportion to a market capitalization in each local market, but without being unduly committed to one, and without being mechanical about pursuing market allocation as opposed to being opportunistic in where we found the best opportunities.","And so just to walk through them, we\u2019ve been under allocated to New York City, which for us is Manhattan. We've been under-allocated to the Bay Area and we've been under-allocated to Seattle. And we call that out repeatedly and we continue to look for opportunities to address that, I think John\u2019s work on this most recent acquisition there\u2019s a lot to address our under-allocation to the Bay Area and \u2013 but we\u2019d continue to look in Seattle if we had an opportunity for attractive pricing we\u2019d invest there and get in Manhattan.","In other markets we felt that our capital \u2013 our allocation was appropriate, but there we wanted to improve the quality of the portfolio and improve the locations and we've called out many times that that was true in Boston, which we've \u2013 are addressing both through our investment at One Canal Street and in our two properties at Kendall Square. And also in Washington, D.C., which is where there is work to be done. So we\u2019ve are 100% committed to being broadly diversified across geographic markets and across price points. And so what I think is correct is that we have become more A oriented and we are aggressively looking for B product as well. And when we have bought these in the recent past at East Point in Boulder last year and at [indiscernible] in San Jose last year and we have an healthy appetite for B property and we would like to maintain that balance.","John Kim","Sure. But I was looking into market exposure and exposure to the markets like Atlanta and Chicago. And I'm wondering how many investors are buying your stock because of those exposures.","Paul Beldin","I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a investor would make a decision on that exact point, but what I do now is that many of them who invest with Aimco know that we have a preference for diversification and that we have expressed \u2013 we said that we are not focused on being concentrated in one, two, three, four, five markets. Those can be winning strategies, but they also include concentration risk that we have chosen to avoid.","John Kim","Okay. On your same-store revenue growth for next year how much of that is driven by the recent development that are hitting the same-store pool next year?","Terry Considine","Sure, John. As we look at what's going to happen with our same-store pool, we are going to be moving in four properties into the pool that we\u2019re acquired in 2014, that\u2019s the East point [indiscernible] properties that Terry just mentioned and then additionally we\u2019ll do moving in 21 specimens which is in the Denver area and then lastly Trimo in Atlanta. And then as we, we\u2019re also will be adding the Trimo developments that have stabilized during the period and that\u2019s PBB in 2900 on first and anything that might come out of that pool will be largely depended upon our sales expectations.","John Kim","So Lincoln Place and Preserve at Marin they were completed its first quarter but is that going to hit your same-store pool next year?","Terry Considine","That\u2019s correct, John. Because those properties are still going through the process of NOI stabilization where we don\u2019t have the up stabilized rents at those properties. We are playing on excluding those until we get a fair competitive year-over-year look at them.","John Kim","Okay. And then finally on the announced acquisition I just wanted to double check that the acquisition price has been fixed and there is no ratchet feature for the seller and also in Aimco was doing the leasing for the asset?","Terry Considine","Yes, so the acquisition price is fixed with one caveat that if we choose to make modifications to the building we can make some modifications to it at our cost. And we will be doing the leasing on the building.","John Kim","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","Good afternoon, John could you give me some more detail on the 49 stabilized NOI cap rate what year is that in and where did the rents that are underlying that cap rate where are they versus where rents to be on the similar product today?","Terry Considine","Okay, I\u2019ll walk you, I don\u2019t have the model right here in front of me, Conor but I will walk you through to the best of my ability and then if we need to take it offline, I\u2019m happy to do so. So that 49 is in the first stabilized years, Paul just mentioned, and we look at stabilization on properties and when they come in \u2013 and we look at two things. One of them is an occupancy stabilization which for us is 95%, but then it also got a rents or a NOI stabilization, which is really the earning of what we think is a stabilized rent.","And so for us in this model that is four years from when we underwrote back in the summer of this year. So it\u2019d really be three years after acquisition. As to the components of that, yes, it is rents that are in place today effectively concept rents today grown by that 3.5 range revenue growth that we\u2019ve talked about earlier. And so in large part those rents we would expect to be about 10% higher little bit over 10% with the compounding in the stabilized year than they are today.","Conor Wagner","Okay. So then, also then particularly 2019 and the 3,800 that stabilized rent in three years from acquisition correct?","Terry Considine","I\u2019m sorry\u2026","Conor Wagner","Did the $3,800 in rent is that where you think rents are today or that $3,800 the\u2026","Terry Considine","That\u2019s where we think rents are at acquisition next year.","Conor Wagner","Okay, add acquisition next. Okay and then \u2013 and then we grow that back three years to get to the $4,900.","Terry Considine","Yes.","Conor Wagner","Okay, great. Thank you, appreciate that. And then\u2026","Terry Considine","Third year after the acquisition, right. So\u2026","Conor Wagner","Okay, thank you. And then Terry you\u2019ve talked about the ability to create a $100 million of value on this project, how do you look at that versus what\u2019s happen in the stock today, I think we can probably attribute most of it to concern over the acquisition given that your operating results were largely expected after the Investor Day?","Terry Considine","Well, Conor, I think the value creation through the acquisition is one that you can calculate looking at current cap rates in that market and current and what John assists told on the underwriting. And so I think that $100 million call at a 30% value creation on an unlevered basis compares favorably to other uses of corporate capital. As to the stock performance today, disappointing time, it\u2019s hard to know what the market will conclude, one thing we\u2019ve tried to do in this call is to be as transparent as we can to emphasize that this is exactly consistent with what we told to the street that we followed very conservative underwriting that we expect is will continue the long-term improvement in portfolio quality, growth rates, free cash flow, internal rates of return, and we think that over time the market is rewarded us for that.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you, Terry.","Terry Considine","Thank you, Conor.","Operator","And our next question is from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Thanks for taking my question. I mean, it\u2019s been well-documented that cap rates have compressed quite a bit in the suburbs, probably more so than CBD locations as of late, the EQR transaction, obviously pointed at, even that you are diversified in your end many, many markets across the country, so then you could talk about, which suburban markets are, I can\u2019t seeing the most cap rate compression based on transactions its happen in the market and kind of just give us some color based on your experience there, and also markets where it\u2019s hasn\u2019t really played out as simply as that?","John Bezzant","Drew, this is John, I\u2019ll take a stab at it. I would tell you that in general terms the true treasury market, small cities in the Midwest or in the south of those current places, compression is compared to what starting point, again it\u2019s becomes part of a question, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not going to call for individual markets how much compression has been it\u2019s out there, there is been simply doubt, but it certainly not as strong as what it is in the so called secondary market. There was a time five years ago, were Denver was considered a secondary market in a lot of peoples mind.","In order today, we might consider it an institutional market. I think a lot of people would consider in institutional market. And so the cap rate compression in the Denver has been very strong and stronger than it would have been in say Kansas City or Omaha. As we look today at, generally speaking secondary markets and I will qualify that is for us outside of our target market. I think cap rates have been pretty consistent for the last two and half years, three years, really since the kind of August tick up in rates around QE2 and things going on back in - I think it was August of 2011, if I remember right.","We\u2019ve got a little hiccup there and then from that point in time, cap rates have come down. Maybe if 50 basis points to 100 basis points over the succeeding year and half two years and it helps pretty flat. And from our perspective as we look at the trades that we\u2019ve made a lot of what we\u2019ve done has been added these treasury markets. The two that we\u2019ve talked about just earlier as the trades for our acquisition, these are sub five cap rates. But one opens in Phoenix, one opens in Alexandria. I\u2019ll leave it to you or you want to call those as secondary sub markets are primary, I would think that our Alexandria is a primary market. Phoenix, depending on how people want to call it. The cap rate on the Phoenix deal is actually lower than the cap rate on the Alexandria deal. ","Drew Babin","I guess just to be clear, I mean my question was more guided towards, [indiscernible] markets of major markets on the year end versus markets that you exceeding there is definitely being cap rate compression in field suburbs in many of your markets and that\u2019s sort of more rough going with that. But moving on the Investor Day in Philly, you talked about, it\u2019s staying within the certain bands in terms of the magnitude of your overall match funding activity. With $320 million of acquisition\/development activity already spoken about for 16 and the additional redevelopment at Park Town place. Is that the bulk of what we should expect for 2016 in terms of match funding activity or could the overall level be higher.","John Bezzant","Well, John again and then I\u2019ll step in if you\u2019d like to. So from a sales perspective, we have outlined the base capital need, but we\u2019re still going to our budget process. And so we will make that call based on capital needs for redevelopment, development activities what our financing strategies are for next year, and ultimately we will have a laid out plan for next year. I can tell you that we are in the market right now today and it\u2019s not secret. You can go to the AMICO dispositions website and see what we got out in the market today, but we have properties out in the market today that will largely meet our identified capital needs for next year. And then it will come to a per trade discussion around, if we find other opportunities that make complying trades, then there may be an opportunity there to continue to work through some of our sales on the secondary locations and acquisitions into something we would consider to be there.","Drew Babin","Okay that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","John Bezzant","Okay, John could you just supplement that a little bit for John, will layout our exact plans in connection with fourth quarter call when comes to guidance for 2016, but our approach for 2016 will be very similar to what is going for the past couple of years, where we will look forth guidance based upon on what we know for acquisitions and dispositions with that point of time, with the expectation that any transaction that we might do does not contemplating that will be match funded on a pair trade basis where we are improving the quality of the portfolio and increasing the free cash flow, internal rate of return.","Drew Babin","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital.","Wes Golladay","Hello everyone, a quick question about the acquisitions, you mentioned you\u2019re looking at this large acquisition for a while. I just wanted if you looking at any more acquisitions over the $215 million market?","John Bezzant","No, John again here. No on a definitive single asset basis no, but we are looking at acquisitions all the time and in those range from operating properties in both the A and B price point categories to under development properties that are going on similar to what we did in Cambridge earlier in the year and this transaction that we\u2019re talking about here.","And we\u2019re already looking for as Terry mentioned earlier anomalies in crevices in the pricing whether where we see that there is an opportunity either because of the seller\u2019s situation, because of the ability to take some lease of risk or do other things that within reasonable balance. We\u2019re not to going to go out and buy billions of dollars worth of reset properties, and through our long end of the portfolio at one time and I\u2019ll definitively see that, but we do look a lot at various transactions and some of you have heard in the past as we\u2019ve talked about it either investor conferences or other places. In 2014, we screened over 400 deals, we under wrote over 200 deals and we bought six and so I don\u2019t want to mislead that we\u2019re not looking at deals. We look at deals a lot, but the number that we execute on is, is very, very small.","Wes Golladay","Okay, and then turning to the current environment, I think you mentioned 21% of the people did not renew due to price, any noticeable markets that stand out here and how are your targeted markets doing versus the once you feel as non-core?","Keith Kimmel","Wes, this is Keith, when we look at the 21% due to price, we\u2019ve anywhere between 19% and 21% for color capacity ten quarter\u2019s or so, so nothing that is materially different there, 21% a little bit up from where it was last quarter 20%, so but nothing that\u2019s really changed.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, its Michael Bilerman here with Nick, Terry on the asset you are acquiring. Is there a construction loan in place and how much is that and will you be assuming it?","Paul Beldin","Michael, this is Paul, I\u2019ll take that whether or not there is a construction loan in place on the project during construction I\u2019m not aware about I\u2019d look to John to supplement that, but what I will tell you is that financing that we are looking at its going to be our own financing that\u2019s been put in place subsequent to the construction we have marketed that the piece of debt to a number of institutions we\u2019ve had great interest and we\u2019re very close to locking that down.","Terry Considine","And I would add there is a construction loan in place we have no exposure and no guarantees around that construction that\u2019s entirely the sellers issue.","Michael Bilerman","And what is the sizing of that construction loan?","Terry Considine","Of their construction loan I have no idea.","Michael Bilerman","And the size of your targeted loan and is that going to be, if I get to assume it\u2019s a floater, just what\u2019s the sizing of that?","Terry Considine","Yes, the loan that we\u2019re going to put in place is going to be a 10-year piece of paper consistent with the majority of the other loans that we have in our portfolio, it will be fixed rate. And we\u2019re still in the process of sizing it, but we\u2019re going to size it likely at a level well below 50%.","Michael Bilerman","And then did you have \u2013 on top of the $320 million is there a closing cost or any other cost above and beyond the $320 million?","Terry Considine","Yes, there are. Yes, there are, they will be between marketing setup closing cost, those kinds of things. There will be some additional cost above the $320 million, we estimate those at less than $2 million.","Michael Bilerman","Less than $2 million? And then as we think about your social mixture, we got the math right. So effectively on a current rent basis today or this summer when you underwrote it, you\u2019re looking at probably something in the low 4% at 95% occupancy that you\u2019re growing 3.5% a year to 2019 upon which it will be 4.9%, does that include at that point any CapEx reserve at all?","Terry Considine","Yes.","Michael Bilerman","And that number\u2026","Terry Considine","Yes, absolutely. So the IRR number that I quote you is a free cash flow internal rate return. That 7.91% assumes $1,200 a door of CapEx which is what we apply consistently on our sales and our acquisitions.","Michael Bilerman","[Indiscernible] 4.9% is that a cash?","Terry Considine","No, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I misunderstood the question, Michael. In terms of CapEx rate that is an NOI CapEx rate. So that is a pre-cap reserve cap rate.","Michael Bilerman","Pre-cap reserve cap rate. Right, so then effectively that if these guys were developing this to let\u2019s say a target of 6%, there\u2019s probably at least could be up $100 million profit in for them.","Terry Considine","I think that\u2019s probably reasonable assumption.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Terry Considine","And while we\u2019re still on your time, Michael, on the next time the cap rate that extra cap rate is $478 million.","Michael Bilerman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, operator, first I\u2019ll thank you for your help today and for all of you on the call, thank you for your interest in Aimco.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgments, including projections related to 2019 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what maybe discussed today. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, Executive Vice President in charge of redevelopment; and Paul Beldin, our CFO. John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer, is present and will also be available to answer questions during the session that follows our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa and good day to each of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good and for Aimco it\u2019s getting better and better. First quarter results were solid ahead of our plan and are the product of an intentional strategy to create net asset value per share through excellence in operations, accretive redevelopment, disciplined capital allocation, and most importantly by Aimco teammates across the country working together with enthusiasm, focus and accountability. These solid results are highlighted in operations, where Keith and his team averaged 97% in daily occupancy, posted peer-leading margins and peer-leading same-store net operating income growth. In redevelopment, these results were evidenced, where Wes and his team started the new redevelopment and continued our investment in ongoing highly accretive projects throughout the portfolio and was evidenced again in portfolio management, where Lisa and her team completed the leverage neutral paired trade funding of last year\u2019s fourth quarter stock buyback by selling 7 lower rated properties at prices slightly better than what we had estimated in our most recent calculation of net asset value. And these results are evidenced on the Aimco balance sheet, which is safe, strong, provides a solid foundation for further growth.","Today, Paul has $0.75 billion in cash and available credit and more than $3 billion in our pool of unencumbered properties, providing safety and great flexibility to pursue future opportunities. Amidst all this hard work, Aimco was named by the Denver Post for the seventh consecutive year, a top workplace in Colorado. As we begin the summer leasing season, the U.S. economy is healthy and we enjoy strong consumer demand and investor interest. I am thankful for the Aimco team, its culture, energy and optimism. And while these remain early days, our prospects are bright and we expect 2019 to be another good year.","And now for a more detailed report in the first quarter, I would like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I am pleased to report that we had a solid first quarter in operations. We have continued to maximize revenue growth through a focus on occupancy. The first quarter finished at 97%, 90 basis points better than the first quarter of 2018. So, it has been consistent from month to month with all 3 months finishing at or above 97%. Due to our consistently higher customer satisfaction and our focus on customer selection, first quarter trailing 12 month turnover was 44%, a 50 basis points improvement from last quarter and our lowest turnover on record.","Turning to our same-store results, revenues were up 4.2% for the quarter. Our top markets with growth over 4.5% are Washington DC, The Bay Area, Boston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. This lift includes our four largest markets and in total represents 65% of same-store revenue contribution. We had solid performances of 3% growth in San Diego, Seattle and Chicago, finally with growth over 1.5% New York City, Denver, Atlanta and Miami. In the first quarter as planned expenses returned to a more Aimco like 80 basis points. This includes an increase in our maintenance costs as we continued to invest in our communities and an increase in our property taxes. This was offset by decreases in turnover expense in marketing due to our resident retention as well as a reduction in personnel costs from our continued focus on team member efficiency. This led to a first quarter margin of 73.2%, 90 basis points better than last year. As a result of our quarterly revenue and expense performance net operating income was up 5.5%.","Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter, new leases were up 80 basis points, renewals were up 5.2% and same-store blended lease rates were up 2.9%. Our strongest new lease rates were in Denver, The Bay Area, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, and with the most pressure on new lease rates in Chicago and Atlanta. Finally, as we look at our preliminary April same-store results we see a solid start to the second quarter that shows a continuation of our momentum. Blended lease rates were up 3.4%, new lease rates up 1.6% and renewals up 5%, all while maintaining average daily occupancy of 97%, some 60 basis points higher than 2018 and with great same-store teams in the field here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco success.","I will turn the call over to Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President of Redevelopment. Wes?","Wes Powell","Thank you, Keith. Today, I will cover our redevelopment and development activity and then move on to acquisitions. During the first quarter we invested a total of $45 million in redevelopment and development and are maintaining our target investment range of between $225 million and $275 million for the year. Current projects remain on plan with construction progressing on the approved phases of investment at Bay Park and the Flamingo and Miami and at our ground up projects in Denver and Elmhurst, Illinois outside of Chicago. In both our Colorado at Park Mosaic we have pre-leased over 10% of our community at rents ahead of underwriting 60 days prior to our initial delivery of apartment homes. ","Also during the first quarter, we began redevelopment activities in Northern California at our 707 Leahy Community located in Redwood City. This 110 unit property is in the process of being vacated in preparation for a construction start early this summer. We are fully repositioning the community originally constructed in 1973 to attract higher income residents who work nearby in what is one of the world\u2019s most dynamic job markets. The renovated homes will be delivered in three phases beginning early next year. Aimco expects to invest $24 million in the redevelopment of Leahy and generate a free cash flow IRR of about 9%.","Moving to acquisitions, in April we closed for $65 million the purchase of One Ardmore, a newly constructed property also containing 110 apartment homes and the fifth and final community included in the Philadelphia portfolio of acquisition announced last year. One Ardmore is located within heart of Downtown One Ardmore, one of Philadelphia\u2019s close-in mainline suburbs in just two blocks from the commuter rail station providing direct access to Center City. The premier location and quality of the asset has attracted a fluid and mature residents during our pre-leasing process. To-date, we have leased about 20% of the property at rates ahead of our underwriting. As originally reported, last year\u2019s Philadelphia portfolio acquisition was expected to produce an NOI yield of more than 5%. At our allocated purchase price One Ardmore stabilized NOI yield was projected to be approximately 5.75% at the time the acquisition was announced. Based on our early leasing success, we now expect yields on One Ardmore to stabilize north of 6%.","And with thanks to all my teammates for their continued hard work and their pursuit of value-creating opportunities both inside and outside of the portfolio, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thank you, Wes. Today, I am going to cover our balance sheet, our first quarter financial results and 2019 guidance and then the changes to our supplemental schedules and reporting.","First, our balance sheet is safe and liquid, which creates opportunity and flexibility. During the first quarter, Aimco sold 7 communities generating sufficient proceeds to complete the leverage neutral paired trade funding for the fourth quarter 2018 share repurchases. The $400 million paired trade is neutral on an NOI yield basis. At Aimco, we believe it is more appropriate to focus on free cash flow yield and free cash flow internal rates of return as these metrics contemplate capital spending required to offset depreciation, which is a very real cost of ownership. This paired trade provides a 20 basis point improvement to free cash flow yields and increases free cash flow internal rates of returns by 250 basis points.","Following the sales Aimco ended the first quarter with $198 million in cash on hand and the capacity to borrow $723 million on our revolving credit facility. And on April 1, Aimco prepaid at par our $168 million of 2019 debt maturities. The repayment of this debt added $740 million of property value to Aimco\u2019s pool of unencumbered properties for a total of $3.3 billion. Also in April, as previously announced, Aimco gave notice that we would redeem the shares of our Class A perpetual preferred stock when callable on May 16. At 6.875%, this $125 million redemption lowers Aimco\u2019s cost of leverage. Inclusive of our balance sheet activities during the past 12 months and after the redemption of the preferred shares, Aimco has reduced net leverage by $200 million, lowered the cost of leverage by 35 basis points and increased the size of our unencumbered pool by more than 60%.","Next on to financial results for the quarter, AFFO was $0.55 per share, $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of guidance due to better than expected operating results by Keith and his team and the timing of G&A related costs. Our first quarter same-store results have us well-positioned as we enter the important summer leasing season and we are ahead of the initial expectations embedded in the midpoint of our guidance, but the year is still young with approximately two-thirds of our 2019 leasing activities still in front of us. Accordingly, we are maintaining our guidance ranges at this time.","Finally, with the first quarter earnings release, Aimco has made a few changes to its supplemental schedules and reporting. The most substantive change is that on January 1, Aimco adopted and accounting standard that changes how indirect costs incurred to obtain resident leases are recognized. These costs are now immediately expensed rather than deferred and amortized. For comparability between periods, Aimco has recast 2018 pro forma FFO to be consistent with 2019\u2019s accounting requirements. As mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, the full year impact of this change to pro forma FFO is $0.02 and there is no effect to our reported AFFO.","Additionally, Aimco began presenting turnover on a trailing 12-month basis rather than the current quarter standing alone or the current quarter multiplied by four. We believe this presentation is more meaningful than single quarter metrics, because turnover is highly seasonal. A detailed definition of how we calculate turnover can be found in the glossary of our earnings release. Lastly, Aimco\u2019s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. This is a 3% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in 2018.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Rocco, I will turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Trent Trujillo of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Trent Trujillo","Hi, good morning out there and thanks for taking the questions. I will start by just congratulating on a good quarter and a nice start to the year. So, Paul, you touched on this in your prepared remarks just a minute ago, but with strong same-store revenue and same-store NOI growth above the 2019 midpoint and your first quarter results above what you had contemplated in guidance, why the hesitation really to raise your guidance? I guess maybe said another way, under what scenario would Aimco only achieve the low end of its range?","Paul Beldin","Hey. Trent. Thank you for the question. The guidance range we believe is still appropriate as stated. It\u2019s something that we looked at. But the facts are that we\u2019re only a third of the way through our leasing activity for the year. And so, as we complete more of our business, we\u2019ll update guidance at that time.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. And Terry, swing this one to you, with your interest in politics, it seems like it\u2019s a question right up your alley. What are your latest thoughts on rent control and affordability initiatives that are sweeping across the country?","Terry Considine","Well, it\u2019s very worrisome and there is a political discussion going on in the country over what should be the role of the government versus a free market, and it won\u2019t surprise to learn that I think that the free market is more efficient and greater wealth production. But it\u2019s a fact that during this quarter Oregon adopted the rent control statute, which is fairly benign, but nevertheless a step in that direction. It\u2019s the fact that in California, notwithstanding our success at the ballet box last fall, it\u2019s again in front of the General Assembly. And in our state of Colorado, it\u2019s been raised and discussed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going forward this year but it\u2019s been a subject of discussion. That would also be true of Illinois where it was raised and discussed but not going forward this year. And, of course, in New York, it\u2019s still pending in Albany. So, it\u2019s an important issue. Its impact on our business depends a little bit on the exact nature of the rent controlling terms, but we\u2019ll just go ahead to deal with it and allocate our capital appropriately.","Trent Trujillo","Alright. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll yield the floor.","Terry Considine","Yes.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning. First one, just wanted to touch on the 707 Leahy redevelopment. And I was wondering if you could give us a little better sense of the scope of that renovation in light of the $215,000 per unit spend. And then if my math is right, I think your all-in basis is a little under $500,000 per unit. So, I\u2019m just curious how you think that stacks up I guess versus replacement cost in the Northern California market.","Wes Powell","Hey, Austin. It\u2019s Wes. I\u2019ll take that one. First off, a little bit on the property. It\u2019s located about a mile from downtown Redwood City, three miles from Stanford, so fantastic location, very high land values. And in this in particular instance the current improvement or the current building that is, has more density then would be allowed if we tore down the building and start it over. And so that really led us to a comprehensive repositioning. So, the scope is going to effectively produce something that should price and appeal the customers in a way that a brand new, property would when we\u2019re done. And so, I guess that\u2019s how we look at the investment there and there may be second part to your question which I\u2019ve missed, but was that responsive?","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes, I was just curious. So, I was giving you an all-in basis of around a little under $500,000 unit for that property and I was curious how that stacks up versus replacement cost in the market. And then if you could also provide what you think the cash-on-cash return would be for that, that\u2019d be helpful.","Wes Powell","Sure. At an all-in basis of $500,000, I think you\u2019re close to it, not still at a bit of a discount to replacement cost and surely if you\u2019re including land value in there. And on the yield, we are looking at about a 5% yield on that one.","Austin Wurschmidt","Right. Thank you there. And then just switching over to dispositions, you guys have sold about $400 million, a little over $400 million at this point year to date at a free cash flow cap rate of 5%. So, as we think about the remaining $400 million embedded in your guidance, how should we think about the quality of assets or cap rate for those deals and then the timing?","Paul Beldin","Hey, Austin, this is Paul. We are evaluating the assets that we are going to sell for the remainder of the year. As you mentioned, we still have about $400 million to go as part of our plan. So, the exact free cash flow cap rate is subject to change, but our expectation says that would not vary significantly from that 5% experienced in the first quarter. And in regards to the timing, it\u2019s probably roughly $100 million here in the second quarter, a similar number in the third and then $200 million in the fourth.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Paul, given your commentary on turnover, what\u2019s been the positive impact to NOI because 150 basis points lower rate of turnover? Given that renewal rates are still higher than new rates, is that $1 million annually that 150 basis points throughout the year saves you $5 million? What\u2019s the magnitude there that we should be thinking about?","Paul Beldin","Rob, it\u2019s a good question and we have looked at that in a number of different ways. And really the way that we think about it most often internally is centered around the differences in profitability between a new lease and a renewal lease because that kind of contemplates turnover, the benefits of our customer service and all aspects of our operations and the and various initiatives they have undertaken. And so broadly, a lease that renews is 20% to 30% more profitable than a new lease.","Rob Stevenson","And that incorporates any downtime as well?","Paul Beldin","It does. It incorporates vacancy loss and related operating expenses.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then second question, the portfolio breakout that you guys provide in the supplemental suggest 52% As, 32% Bs and 16% Cs. Keith, any notable performance differential between the same store performance of those buckets in the first quarter or over the trailing sort of six months or a year?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, we when we look at it, we like to use new lease price as the best barometer of just sort of what\u2019s transacting in that moment. And when we look at it over this past quarter the Bs have been outperforming the As, by about 90 basis points. Now, what I would really point out is that becomes varied by market and also by property. So, depending if it\u2019s in Miami or Los Angeles or Boston, you get some different variations with that, but that\u2019s the general overview.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And Terry, what\u2019s the going forward rationale for maintaining that sort of 16% weighting in Cs? It\u2019s been pretty consistent for you guys for a while now. What do you get out of that portfolio wise?","Terry Considine","Primarily it\u2019s a land bank for future redevelopment. And so, it\u2019s properties that we don\u2019t think are as highly rated, that\u2019s why it\u2019s graded to C. But there are some value or attributes that aren\u2019t captured in the current rental rate.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Shirley Wu, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shirley Wu","Hey, thanks for the time guys. So, your occupancy has been very high at 97%. Could you talk about your length of stay trend and maybe some of the initiatives or strategies that you\u2019re using to kind of drive that number or how does [indiscernible] your side?","Keith Kimmel","Shirley this is Keith. Just I want to make sure I answer I heard the first part about length of stay. What was the second piece of the question?","Shirley Wu","I was curious if you guys have changed any of your strategies or had new initiatives on the leasing side to kind of drive different length of stay?","Keith Kimmel","Okay. So, first if we go to our length of stay, we\u2019ve seen it been creeping up and that\u2019s really a reflection of the turnover number. So, if you look at the turnover number at the end of the day, it\u2019s that our residents are becoming more-sticky and we\u2019re seeing them stay with us longer over periods of time, and we think that\u2019s a direct reflection also to the, our customer satisfaction and the way we think about serving our residents. Ultimately, we\u2019re looking to create a special customer experience in which they will stay with us longer and through those pieces it ultimately has found its way to our average daily occupancy increasing.","Shirley Wu","Okay, thanks. And so, your Los Angeles market was one of the strongest this quarter, could you talk about the latest thing or next that you are seeing in that market, given what we\u2019ve been hearing about a little bit weaker job growth in that market?","Keith Kimmel","Shirley, I can\u2019t speak to the economics of the city but I could speak to what I can tell you about our buildings. An those that are located on the west side of LA in Mid-Wilshire, have been just performing at really a tremendous level. Our occupancy has been north of 97% and what I\u2019d say is that, while there\u2019s the city is very large. And there\u2019s different sub-markets within Los Angeles and where we\u2019re located, we\u2019re quite pleased and we\u2019ve seen some nice strength.","Shirley Wu","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. It looks like the number of same-store units went up 8% sequentially from last quarter. What\u2019s the impact of the pool change on same-store revenue growth in 1Q?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, Nick. Yes, we at the beginning of the year as is our tradition, we update our same-store pool for the expected activities that\u2019s going to occur through the year. And so, in \u201819 what that did was that it added a total of 11 communities to our same-store pool, primarily communities that were coming out of occupancy and NOI stabilization from redevelopment and lease-up activities at One Canal and Indigo and then we removed eight communities, five due to their sales here in the first quarter and three others due to either their expected redevelopment or their expected sale later in 2019. And so, although there was a lot of activity in the changes in the pool, the actual impact of the same-store growth rate is pretty minimal. As we look to the numbers, we estimated that was about a 10-basis point impact to both revenue and NOI.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And now that the buyback is complete with the sales, special dividend, reverse stock split, how do you think about the execution of the paired trade overall versus your objective? And then what\u2019s your appetite to do more if the stock continues to trade at a discount versus your NAV estimates?","Terry Considine","Nick, I\u2019m happy to answer that. We like to eat our own cooking. And if the price is right, we\u2019ll buy again.","Nick Joseph","So, you\u2019re happy with the execution on the first buyback?","Terry Considine","I think so. I do.","Paul Beldin","And Nick, this is Paul just to jump. The feedback that we\u2019ve received from our investor base has been quite positive. And they have appreciated the fact that the combination of the stock dividend and the reverse stock split allowed for easier comparability of our per share metrics and so we are happy that our primary goal was achieved in that effort.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. On your improvement on your new lease growth rate that you had progressing throughout the year, what would you say is the number one reason why this is happening? Is it attributable to your Company-specific reduced turnover or is it market forces, including new supply bringing up market rent?","Keith Kimmel","John, I\u2019ll start and see if anybody wants to add. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bunch of combinations. The first is that we saw the total revenue. So, there\u2019s lots of levers that come into that and so we don\u2019t focus on one particular thing [indiscernible] just new lease rate or just occupancy. Certainly, when you get more highly occupied, that gives you some different choices potentially is how you can push rates or make different decisions. We\u2019re seeing some good growth is basically that the season has been picking up, and that\u2019s also part of it is that as you come out of the winter months, we\u2019re seeing a nice spring acceleration. That\u2019s where I would leave it.","Terry Considine","Yes, John, what I would add this is Terry, what I would add to it is two things. First of all, the economy is quite good and so there\u2019s the following win for all of us. And secondly, it\u2019s the accumulation of many, many individual activities, whether it\u2019s individual teammates or just we\u2019re getting better at what we do or the properties are in better condition because of consistent capital spending over many years or the upgrades provided by Wes and his team. And the fact is, we\u2019re getting better.","John Kim","And then on your disposition, it looks like the price per unit was pretty modest price. Can you share what the cap rate was? And also, it\u2019s a little bit surprising that your percentage of these hasn\u2019t changed in the past year just given it looks like you\u2019re selling some fees, you\u2019ve been upgrading some buildings and then you have developments and acquisitions that are mostly on the A side. So, if you can comment on that scenario that would be great as well.","Paul Beldin","This is Paul and I will comment on the economics and then I\u2019ll turn it over for somebody else to jump in about the portfolio mix. The economics of the first quarter sales, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, were in line with the pricing that we expected to achieve and in fact a little bit better than what was included in our net asset value. And so those sales prices translated to an NOI cap rate of 5.6% and a free cash flow cap rate of 5%.","Keith Kimmel","Well and John, if I could jump in here. We don\u2019t determine the grade of C. That grade is determined by the market, by the rental rates being paid by individual customers. So, a property can be a C for its current use as a rental apartment, but it might be A as a piece of land. And so, as I said in my answer to Rob earlier, most of what we have, I think maybe all of what we have in the C category would be something that is being held for future redevelopment.","John Kim","But is it typical for a B to fall into the C over a year?","Paul Beldin","Yes. And that \u2013 those are \u2013 there may be some changes in mix, in names, but over a lifetime property start as As and eventually become Bs and eventually become Cs.","John Kim","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.","Alex Kubicek","Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew. We were hoping for some market level comments regarding leasing trends through April. Any markets jumping off the page starting peak leasing season off to a great foot and any disappointing or lagging thus far?","Keith Kimmel","Yes, this is Keith. I\u2019ll walk you through it. Listen, it\u2019s early days and we\u2019ve started off strong. I would tell you that we continue to see strength in the Bay Area that has been really, really playing out well, D.C. also of course has picked up and we\u2019re feeling good about that. Outside of that, I\u2019d just say that it\u2019s still early and a lot of work in front of us.","Alex Kubicek","Understood. And just kind of coming back to the asset disposition pool. Can you \u2013 were those assets sold in any portfolio constitutions are all one-offs, and if so, could you give us kind of how that NOI cap rate varied across assets and just kind of what those assets\u2019 age profile and quality looked like?","John Bezzant","Alex, this is John. They were sold as one-off deals and the composition of them is, they are generally older, generally garden style communities. I think we had one tower that\u2019s old, an older tower in suburban D.C. that\u2019s sold, but most of them are older garden communities.","Alex Kubicek","And would you say most of those assets were kind of in the ballpark of that 5.6% or was there a range?","John Bezzant","Yes, no, they were all pretty tight, pretty tight in that.","Alex Kubicek","Great. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson at SMBC. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good morning out there. So, Keith, a question to you. At 97% occupied, I know you said you have levers to solve for total revenue, but is it reasonable to assume heading into heavy leasing season that you will see occupancy drift down a bit while you push rents when the getting is good?","Keith Kimmel","Rich, thanks for the question. Listen, I think what\u2019s important to know is, is that the majority of our leases expire in the second and third quarter. So, you get some frictional vacancy just by the number of transactions and activity that\u2019s recurring and we will use each of those levers as we work our way through that peak season whether it\u2019s new or renewal or occupancy to make sure that they all work to solve the total revenue.","Rich Anderson","Alright. So, I guess I\u2019ll leave it at that. And then second follow-up question is, there are some unique characteristics to Aimco that like sort of paint the picture for you, whether it\u2019s top Echelon same-store growth that you\u2019re producing right now, your paired trade strategy, redevelopment, Philadelphia entree, these are all kind of unique to you guys to some degree and also quality of income improvements. I\u2019m wondering of the things that you think are unique to you, what could still be improved upon whether it\u2019s increasing the unencumbered pool that you described earlier, maybe more deleveraging beyond paying off the preferred later this year, you\u2019re going to stay with redevelopment in the range that you\u2019ve communicated in the past. But I\u2019m just wondering, what sort of fixes at the margin are you looking at for Aimco 2020?","Terry Considine","Rich, I\u2019m going to ask for the opportunity to answer that, partly because I want to say what a pleasure it is to hear your voice. So, glad to have you back.","Rich Anderson","It\u2019s a pleasure [ph].","Terry Considine","Yes. I think the \u2013 your list was important, but it didn\u2019t include what I actually think is the foundation for what we are doing which is culture. And culture eats strategy for breakfast. And what we have today at Aimco is a remarkable team that\u2019s cohesive and hardworking and highly productive. And that is something that\u2019s hard to give an exact metric on. We get different accolades from different evaluators and so forth and we measure it and we try to respond to it. But I think people who work for the company recognize that there is a very talented team and that gives us the opportunity to look at a lot of different directions. If you look at then against the other items some of which you listed, in operations, I \u2013 Keith will be the first to tell you that I\u2019d look at, it is at only 97% occupancy and is at only 5.5% NOI growth and he feels the same way. So, we have 100 different things in operations that we can do better and we\u2019re working on them. In redevelopment, where Wes is building a team, we\u2019re not opportunity-constrained, we are more constrained by our management capacity to address all of them. And as his team matures and develops, I think we will see that continue to grow beyond the increase that\u2019s built in in this year.","In terms of the balance sheet, Paul has put us in very good shape. We\u2019ve got lots of flexibility. We have a very safe balance sheet primarily non-recourse, very limited refunding risk, no entity risk. And so \u2013 but the natural process of that will be to increase the unencumbered pool, which will give us enhanced flexibility both either today or in a difficult time that might be in the future. I think what I skipped over in that list was portfolio management. And I think that we are focusing as a team on more opportunities to find anomalies in a market that is fairly fully priced. And so it\u2019s not to say, do more volume, that could be profitless, but to look for anomalies that might have the potential for higher growth and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.","Rich Anderson","Okay, alright, thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes, good morning. In regards to acquisitions, you didn\u2019t do any during the quarter, although you did the subsequent deal. When you think about your acquisition outlook, just curious specifically what you\u2019re kind of looking \u2013 what you\u2019re kind of looking at and what you would be interested in, whether it\u2019s specific markets, whether it\u2019s to further own B assets over A assets because of pricing? Just trying to get a general sense.","Terry Considine","Tayo, this is Terry again. We\u2019re looking for the highest free cash flow IRRs on a risk adjusted basis and of course \u2013 and leverage neutral. So, if we could \u2013 and that\u2019s a question of price. And in today\u2019s market, where money is very inexpensive and there\u2019s lots of it, many assets are very fully priced. And so, we are looking for is not so much in particular asset class, but at ones where there is some particular aspect that would create the opportunity for above average growth. And then I think if you look at our acquisitions in the last year, you\u2019ll see there is a different reason behind each of them.","Tayo Okusanya","Right.","Terry Considine","And so when we bought Bent Tree a year ago, that was an operational advantage, which we think that the value creation there was partly Wes\u2019 team identifying that it could be \u2013 its results were not as good as those of our neighboring properties and then having confidence that Keith\u2019s team could come in and achieve significant increases over the predecessors in operation. Another transaction that followed was the Dranoff transaction was a very excellent developer in the market that we like. We don\u2019t necessarily look at what others do and the opportunity to buy in scale and have a placement of equity at a price that was then well above market in the OP Unit transaction and so forth. So, we\u2019re looking for different opportunities. We love covered land plays because we think over time, land depreciates and buildings don\u2019t. And we just look for what opportunities might it be out there, but it wouldn\u2019t be necessarily one for across all of our acquisition interest.","Tayo Okusanya","Got it. Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Terry, I\u2019d like to go back to the political climate out here in California. Curious to get your thoughts on Senate Bill 50, perhaps one of the more productive responses to affordable housing issues and whether that changes your views on the demand versus supply backdrop across your portfolio over the next call 5, 10 years?","Terry Considine","John, I\u2019m not familiar with Senate Bill 50 in any current versions. Is that the one that is providing incentives for building around transit stops and so forth?","John Pawlowski","Yes, around transit stops, but also it breaks down barriers to apartment supply in single-family zone neighborhoods, so I expect they\u2019ve broadened it?","Terry Considine","Yes, I guess what I would \u2013 I\u2019m generally familiar with that, I\u2019m not familiar with in particular. But what it shows is even in California with high levels of regulation, there is a bit of a market at work. California has \u2013 population growth is stalled because of the high cost of housing and the burden of regulation on economic growth. And so, even with the most and one of the most regulated governments, they\u2019re trying to find a way to have markets work to create housing for people. And they\u2019ve chosen to do it by attacking those regulations, if you will. That\u2019s what that is, that\u2019s deregulating the \u2013 just that maze of restrictions on development activity in California at least in those specific locations. And so I think that\u2019s very positive for California, be positive for economic growth and in the end will be positive for Aimco and it\u2019s our probably $4 billion or $5 billion investment in the state, because it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019ll mean that California does better.","John Pawlowski","Okay, makes sense. Paul or Keith, of the $100 million that you guys spent last year on capital enhancements, which I believe a lot is revenue generating in nature. Could you quantify the lift on 2019 same-store revenue growth for us?","Paul Beldin","Hi John, this is Paul. I\u2019ll take that. I mean, in our capital enhancement spending where we last year spent about $100 million, the midpoint of our range this year is a little bit lower than that. It encompasses a wide range of spending. So, there\u2019s an element of it that does provide for future revenue growth and we think that\u2019s a very good investment, because it allows us to be a more profitable operating entity for our investors, which is I think everybody\u2019s ultimate goal in this business. And then there\u2019s also elements of the CE spending that is \u2013 allows us to reduce our operating expenses. So, we get a benefit and the shareholders get a benefit regardless of the classification. What I would say is there\u2019s not really a lift to the 2019 results, because our spending is similar year-over-year. So, it\u2019s built into our run rate, if you will.","John Pawlowski","Okay. How \u2013 I understand not the year-to-year dynamics, just the aggregate lift on a run rate, how much lower would the run rate be if you had not spent this type of capital over the last several years?","Paul Beldin","Hey, John, I hate to get into hypotheticals like that and say what we didn\u2019t do because there are other things that we didn\u2019t do that we could have done. So, I\u2019m just going to stay away from that.","John Pawlowski","Yes, understood. Last one if I may, G&A run rate over the next 3 to 5 years, is inflation a good kind of bogey or are there opportunities to cut G&A?","Terry Considine","John, I hope there\u2019s opportunities to increase G&A, because it\u2019s all connected to adding value to the company. And so, if we have a change in activities, a change in scale, a change in concentration on redevelopment, change \u2013 whatever our business evolves, if it will turn on the men and women on the Aimco team doing that, and if the appropriate consequence of that is that they are highly paid for their contribution, it could increase. So, that\u2019s not something that I would want to manage outside of context. Beyond that we have a general goal and culture of being frugal. So, I think those are two balance points.","John Pawlowski","Makes sense. Thanks, Terry.","Terry Considine","Thank you, John.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Rocco, thank you and thank you all of you on the call. Many of you I hope we will see in New York, and I look forward to seeing you there and if not, I wish you a happy spring and an early summer. Talk to you later. Bye.","Operator","Thank you.

And welcome to the Aimco Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, forward looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2020 and future year expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainty, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are designed and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's Web site.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, Executive Vice President, in charge of Redevelopment; and Paul Beldin, our CFO. Other members of management are present and will be available during our question-and-answer session, which will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa and good morning to all of you in this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Last year was a good year for Aimco as we detailed in the earnings release published yesterday afternoon. And while I'm delighted by these good results, I'm even more energized by the bright prospects for Aimco in 2020 and beyond.","We expect to meet or beat the 2020 forecast we made last fall, and to finish this year with further growth in prospects for 2021 and thereafter. Aimco has the advantage of world-class property operations, value creating redevelopments accretive investments in real estate, long dated and low cost non-recourse property debt and a high performing cohesive team.","In the next few minutes, Keith, Wes and Paul, will detail very solid performance in 2019 and our high expectations for 2020. And with that I offer my Aimco teammates many and sincere thanks for what we accomplished last year. And for the success we see ahead for this year.","For more details, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operation. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter in operations. Our operating philosophy begins with a relentless focus on customer selection and exceptional customer service. We continue to refine and execute this playbook every day, and it leads to lower turnover, higher occupancy, better pricing power, maximized revenues, more new costs and better margin.","Based on more than 13,000 surveys in the fourth quarter, customer satisfaction was 4.3 out of 5 stars. This is the first time we've achieved this mark, an indicative of our continued drive to deliver a world-class resident experience. This dedication to customer service means that residents want to live with us longer, leading to our lowest turnover on record 43.2%, a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year.","As a result, our average daily occupancy was an Aimco best 97.4%, 40 basis points better than 2018 and we accelerated throughout the quarter from 97.1% in October to 97.9% in December. This approach translated to solid top line growth with revenues up 3.3% for the quarter. Our top markets with growth over 4.5% were Denver, Philadelphia, Washington DC and Boston. Solid all in markets with growth over 1.5% were San Diego, Los Angeles, Atlanta, the Bay Area and Miami. Finally, margins with growth of 50 basis points to 1% were New York, Chicago and Seattle.","Now turning to expenses. Controllable operating expenses were flat for 2019, and up 2.1% in the fourth quarter due to lower marketing and turn cost from improved retention, offset by higher investments in our communities. Total expenses were up 2.4% for the year and grew 4.4% in the quarter, driven by taxes and utilities. As a result, fourth quarter net operating income grew 2.9% and margins were 74.8%. For the full year, our margin was 73.7%, a 40 basis point improvement over 2018.","Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter; new lease rates were up 70 basis points; renewal rates were up 5%; and same-store blended lease rates were up 2.4%, 30 basis points better than 2018. As we look at our preliminary January results, we're tracking towards a solid start to our 2020 plan; blended lease rates are up 2.5%; new leases up 1%, 120 basis points better than 2019; renewals up 5.6%, a 70 basis point improvement, all while achieving average daily occupancy of 97.8%, some 80 basis points better than last year.","Finally, turning to our 2020 outlook. We see another solid year on top markets with planned revenue growth of 3.5% to 5%, are Philadelphia, Seattle, Boston, Washington DC, San Diego and Miami. We expect growth of 2.5% to 3.5% in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and the Bay area, and revenue growth of 1.5% to 2.5% in New York and Chicago. To the operations team, thank you for your dedication to innovation and a passion for serving our residents.","I'll now turn the call over to Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President of Redevelopment. Wes?","Wes Powell","Thanks Keith. Today, I'll provide a brief summary of our 2019 portfolio management and investment activities, and we'll also discuss our plans for 2020. Details on fourth quarter activity can be found within our release.","In 2019, Aimco continued with its paired trade strategy, re-allocating capital from lower rent growth markets such as suburban Chicago and from properties that produce lower operating margins without the opportunity for value creating reinvestment. That capital was redeployed to the higher growth number of markets, such as Miami, Denver, Cambridge and San Francisco, while improving upon our geographic allocation and to also increase its rate on investment.","During the past year, $230 million was invested in redevelopment and development projects, up 30% year-over-year. This activity creates shareholder value and will lead to accelerated earnings growth when apartments are completed and leased. In 2019, Aimco delivered 335 new or fully renovated homes. Of these, more than 80% are currently leased at rental rates ahead of our underwriting.","Now turning to 2020. Aimco expects to increase its annual investment in redevelopment and development to between $250 million and $300 million, creating approximately $100 million of shareholder value. During the year, we plan to complete construction on approximately 500 homes whose run rate contribution at stabilization will be $17.5 million in annual revenues.","Flamingo Point North Tower will remain under construction through 2020. And when it's 366 homes are occupied and stabilized, they will contribute over $14 million of annual revenue and in some market with strong growth prospects. Additionally, we retained a deep pipeline and plan to commence new redevelopment projects during the year, and look forward to providing details on those when the time is right.","Finally, we will continue to seek accretive opportunities outside of our existing portfolio where we can earn superior returns as a result of operational excellence, value creating redevelopment and ideally both. Any new investments will be funded on a leverage neutral basis from the sale of communities with lower forecasted free cash flow IRRs.","And with thanks to all of my teammates for their continued hard work and constant pursuit of value-creating opportunities, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thank you, Wes. Today, I'm going to give a quick recap of 2019 results, provide details on our 2020 guidance, discuss our balance sheet and comment on Aimco's 2020 dividend.","First 2019 same-store NOI growth of 4.3% was 70 basis points better than our guidance of one year ago, driven by 50 basis points of better than expected revenue growth. The strong same store growth reported by Keith and the accretive investments discussed by Wes, contributed to full year AFFO being $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of guidance provided at the beginning of the year.","Looking back, it is important to recall that Aimco's year-over-year AFFO growth for the first three quarters of 2019 was impacted by the July 2018 sale of the asset management business. With the dilution from the sale behind us, fourth quarter AFFO grew by 12%. We've expect the strong growth to continue in 2020.","Aimco expects AFFO to be between $2.34 and $2.44 per share, representing $0.19 per share or 9% growth at the midpoint, approximately $0.13 of this growth is expected from Aimco's same-store portfolio with NOI growth between 3.2% and 4.6%. The remaining $0.06 of growth is primarily due to a $0.06 net contribution from the mezzanine loan made to the partnership that owns partner set 5% and $0.04 of incremental AFFO from our redevelopment and development communities, offset by approximately $0.05 of dilution from properties sold to fund our investments.","Please keep in mind the $0.04 net contribution from our redevelopment and development communities is expected to increase after consideration of funding costs by another $0.18 per share as these properties are stabilized over the following three years.","Next I'd like to discuss the components of our expected same store NOI growth. We forecast 2020 same store revenue growth between 3% and 3.8%. Our revenue growth expectations are based on the following. The earning from our 2019 leasing activities is expected to contribute 130 basis points to 2020 revenue growth. The contribution of 2020 leasing activities is dependent upon a number of factors, including resident satisfaction and quality, retention percentages, lease pace and lease rates.","We expect these factors to add 170 basis points to 250 basis points to year-over-year revenue growth. Blended lease rates are expected to be similar to or better than the 3.4% achieved in 2019. Over the full year, we expect average daily occupancy to increase in 2020 but at a slower pace than the 60 basis point improvement achieved in 2019. While January is not yet complete and January results are not yet fully available, we're encouraged by what we do know. For example, January 2020 average daily occupancy was up by 80 bps.","Turning to same store expense growth. We expect total same stores expense growth of 1.6 to 2.4%. Of these costs, we expect controllable operating expenses to be up by 50 basis points or less. Aimco's relentless focus on innovation and customer service has resulted in no increase in controllable operating expenses for more than a decade.","Now turning to our balance sheet, in the fourth quarter, Aimco sold four communities, generating net proceeds of $201 million. Another $300 million of year end and January sales were delayed. This delay increased our leverage to EBITDA ratio by three tenths of a turn, but we expect better pricing this year if the transaction market remains deep, liquid and attractively priced. Our leverage to EBITDA ratio is above our target of 7.0, but we expect this to be temporary. In 2020, we expect to repay approximately $550 million of leverage funded by property sales and still reduce leverage to EBITDA by approximately one turn.","Looking into the future, we expect continued same store NOI growth and incremental $27 million contribution from our redevelopment and investments to further reduce our leverage to EBITDA ratio by another turn or more. Finally, after a solid 2019 and with strong AFFO growth expected for 2020, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share, a 5% increase over the regular quarterly dividends paid in 2019.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Rocco, I'll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","I'm wondering if we could get a little more color on the decision to delay the asset sales, and maybe where were you in the process when you made that decision?","Lisa Cohn","We have a number of properties in the market as we did in the last year, and we're just looking for the best execution in terms of pricing. So we finally have a couple under contract and we're just going to keep looking to get the lowest cost of capital. And I think Paul said in his prepared remarks, we have a broad group of buyers and lots of people looking, those markets are deep and liquid and we can get pricing we're looking for this year.","Nick Joseph","So when you initially took them out to market, the pricing just wasn't what you thought it should be. Is that essentially what you're saying?","Lisa Cohn","I mean, we just didn't have to sell them at that moment, and there we're looking to maximize price and deals have an ebbs and flows and things happen people go through due diligence. And so we had the opportunity to make that decision.","Nick Joseph","And what does guidance assume in terms of the timing of the asset sales this year?","Paul Beldin","Nick, this is Paul. We expect to sell the $950 million of properties at the midpoint of our range throughout the course of the year. We expect those first sales will occur late in the first quarter or early second and then remainder will proceed through the year. As we get more of these sales under contract with hard money down, we'll provide more precise timing.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shirley Wu","So my first question has to do with your two markets that you've highlighted before of higher supply you have in Center City and Mid-Wilshire. So in terms of what you're seeing now? Have you started to feel the impact in terms of concessions or slower velocity? And when do you really expect to see the full bulk of that market impact of your portfolio?","Keith Kimmel","Shirley, this is Keith. I'll start and then if Paul wants to add some more global supply insights. Your particular question around the Mid-Wilshire portfolio, we feel really good about where we're positioned there, and most of that supply that's coming in actually in Korea town. And so where we're particularly located, we think that it's while it will be impactful in that part of Wilshire, we're further west and we think that we're in a better spot and we'll keep our eye on it, but we're going into the year in a strong position and feel good about the look forward in LA. Paul, do you want to add to that?","Paul Beldin","Just to comment on Center City, Philadelphia. Shirley, as I'm sure you recall. Center City Philadelphia has seen elevated levels of new supply since 2016. And so the encouraging fact for us is that those levels are continuing to decline and 2020 is expected to be the lowest year of any of the past five. And during the previous four years, our Center City assets have performed very well. And as Keith highlighted in his prepared remarks, Philadelphia is going to be one of our strongest markets next year.","Shirley Wu","So my next question has to do with as far as the redevelopment plans. So you previously talked about redevelopment for East 88th in your work. So could you tell us a little bit more about where you are in that process and what that could potentially look like, what is built in the product offering?","Wes Powell","Shirley, it's Wes. You're right that's a project like many that is in our pipeline and we're actively pursuing that one. We feel great about the opportunity there. It's kind of a perfect case where we've owned property for a long time with high land value and have the ability to unlock that value when the time is right. It'd be premature to go into details right now. We're still working through the process. But as I think we stated before, it would be a higher density development on that site and have to talk about the details when we're ready to announce that one.","Operator","Our next question today comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Couple of questions on your guidance, so it sounds like you believe blended lease growth rates will be higher year-over-year and occupancy is starting off the year higher as well. Yet you widen your same-store guidance both at the top end and at the bottom end of the range and basically kept the point the same. Why would there not be an upward bias on your same store guidance this year?","Paul Beldin","John, this is Paul. You're right that the midpoint of our guidance that we issued last night was consistent with our preliminary outlook that we published at the end of September. As we discussed on the third quarter call, our preliminary outlook really provided a range of where we thought the midpoint of our guidance would land. And so as we were setting guidance for the full year, we continue our historical practice of having about 100 basis point range around our operating metrics and about $0.10 range around our earnings metrics or FFO and AFFO. So it's nothing more than that.","John Kim","Is portfolio mix part of this? And also on a related topic, your capital enhancements guidance is down 30% year-over-year, and I know that's been a driver or one of the drivers of same store revenue growth. Is that potentially one of the reasons why you've widened that range?","Paul Beldin","No, to comment on each of those, the portfolio that we expect to have for our same-store pool in 2020 is consistent with what we use to form our preliminary outlook. And then in regards to CEs at the time that we published our outlook, we were far enough along in the planning process but we were expecting a decline in our spend in 2020 and that de3cline is really driven by nothing more than the factory in both '19 and in 2018, we invested quite a bit of capital in rolling out smart rents and the associated smart technologies. Now that we're done with that across the entire portfolio that investment is coming down.","Operator","Next question today comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Back to the disposition delays. Were those specific through a single market or was it a broad based group of assets? And were any of those assets within the group that was under contract as of last quarter's call?","Lisa Cohn","They were not any assets that contacted last quarter's call those we closed at the end of 2019, and they were in a variety of markets and not with a single buyer or anything like that.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then as it relates to partner set, when was the mezz investment funded? Was it at a single period or is it being sort of funded over a period of time? And then how soon could Phase 2 at partner set get underway? Any restrictions I guess related to Phase 1 getting complete or otherwise?","Paul Beldin ","Austin, it was all funded simultaneously. It's closing in late November. As to phase two, yes it's conditioned on phase one taking place. They are out right now actively rebidding their design plans for Phase 1A and B and we anticipate that they will proceed through development processes as that continues.","Austin Wurschmidt","And just one quick follow up, if you did $1.5 million of mezz investment income and as of the fourth quarter, the annualized that it gets you to $18 million, a little bit shy of sort of the 27.5-ish that you might expect. What were the offsetting items for that line item?","Paul Beldin ","You're correct that our mezzanine income that was reported on our income statement was a million and half. And what that reflects is the interest that we accrued as a contractual rate of 10%, offset by certain costs that were incurred while originating the loan that were not eligible for deferral.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead. ","Rob Stevenson","Keith, when you and your team put together your market view for 2020, what market or markets had the biggest delta in terms of the range of potential same store revenue growth outcomes for the year? And is the driver behind the gap anything other than the amount and timing of new supply?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, thank you for that. Really when we put it together that we had a stronger pickup when we look at the average daily occupancy from '19 to '20, there's not any particular market that had any particular change or outlook on it that drove the difference.","Rob Stevenson","And then how is your A, B, C plus portfolio mix going to change when you factor in the billion dollar of dispositions this year, and then what you're doing in the development, redevelopment, projects under construction and any acquisitions that are in the pipeline. I mean, you're now up 54% A, it's up 300 basis points year over year. How significantly does that accelerate when you factor in all of these transactions that are coming through for you guys?","Paul Beldin ","I'll address it and let anybody else supplement my response. You're right. Currently we're about 52-54% As, which is a little more heavy than we'd prefer. And as part of our redevelopment, a lot of times what happens is that we'll see the greatest opportunity to create value for our shareholders by taking a community that is in a A location with A, but at a B rental price and so thereby, creating value by bringing that community up to an A price point. And so that as a byproduct increases that allocation.","But as we look forward, we'd like to see a greater allocation to that that B price point. And so I think as we go throughout our sales this year, you'll see a mix of sales. We still have a few hundred million of assets that are at that C plus and B price point that will be sold likely in 2020, but there'll also be an allocation likely of As. So over the longer term, we'll seek to bring that percentage down.","Rob Stevenson","So that billion dollars of disposition. Is it primarily just Bs and Cs?","Paul Beldin ","It's a mix. And as Lisa said, we've seen a lot of interest in the assets that are in the market and we expect to see really attractive pricing. So that exact mix will be dependent upon pricing, but we feel very confident about the opportunity we have ahead of us.","Rob Stevenson","So in the near term, you wouldn't expect the As to get above 60% or anything?","Paul Beldin ","No.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","So Terry, can you go back to Parkmerced for a second? I guess. I know we had a call about it late last year, but I don't think we had all the information that we know now, the assets' cash flow, the existing CMBS loans. So I'm interest in the loans, the attractive coupon you're getting there, the embedded value in the asset and the accretion from the loan. But we've also heard some concerns from investors who see it as the latest detour on your road to simplifications, as well as concerns about the cash flow shortfall and the inability, at least right now, to fully cover the interest obligations on your mezz fee. So I guess I'm curious, how do you and the board factor all this into your decision process? And is there anything more you want to share for those who might still have some concerns over the transaction?","Terry Considine","Well, Haendel, first of all, thank you for the question and thank you for your piece this morning. I thought that was thoughtful and I read whatever 15 or 20 of them, and yours stood out as insightful. As to your question about Parkmerced, it is certainly something that the board, and I, and the management team thought about. We feel very comfortable about the balance between risk and reward. We think the downside is fairly limited, both as you see from appraisal but also from the nature of the underlying cash flows of the rent control portfolio. So we feel very good about the downside in it. And the upside from 6,000 entitled units without rent control in San Francisco is a big number. And so I think we feel pretty good about that.","Haendel St. Juste","And so it certainly sounds like over the next five years, there's an anticipation that the read and maybe some increased occupancy or rent increases could help cover the shortfall. But if not, you do right to force control -- force the sale of the assets. Is that correct?","Terry Considine","I'm not sure, I caught the question. But the first part of it, I guess, I'm completely comfortable that natural operation of the rent control business will lead to increased cash flows that will overtime cover the cash requirements or the interest rates of the mezz loan. But there's a second part to your question, which I just didn't hear.","Haendel St. Juste","My understanding, and maybe correct me if I'm wrong is that, if that we're not be the case, if they're still in the shortfall by year five, you do have a mechanism by which you can potentially force the sale of the assets. Is that right?","A - Unidentified Company Representative","Haendel, this is John. So they've got an explicit forced sale right in the loan agreement. There is obviously a foreclosure right in the loan agreement, and if it doesn't get repaid in year five when it's due then there's a lot of different consequences that will come into play.","Haendel St. Juste","And just one more quickly. Is there anything on Brickell perhaps you can update us on, any updated thoughts or plans? I know you've been contemplating a range of options. But just curious if there's anything new to share on that front.","Wes Powell","Haendel, it's Wes. Thanks for the question. I'd say, again, in terms of the operating assets there, it's continuing to track along ahead of expectations, we feel good about that. And otherwise, no, nothing new to report but we like the optionality and we'll update you as something comes to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman and Associates.","Hardik Goel","Thanks for taking my question. Just on the -- Paul, you just mentioned there's some cost components that couldn't be deferred. As I think about future what's the good run rate, not just for 2020? But on your assumptions, it looks like there's going to be a slight increase in 2021 as well. What's the cadence of including those costs?","Paul Beldin","So we talked about, Hardik, that the contribution to 2020's AFFO is going to be $0.06, and that's net of the cost of funding. And so looking forward, we continue to expect to be able to collect the 10% coupon or $275 million. There's a small amount of costs that were eligible to be deferred and that'll offset it slightly, but not to a massive extent.","Hardik Goel","So just for clarity, the [6%] is not net, that's just the accretion from the -- considering the cost of funding and then you have an additional cost that comes out of the $0.06?","Paul Beldin","No, the $0.06 is the all in benefit to 2020's numbers.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","First, a quick modeling question. I see the same-store revenue top-line revenue was about $4 million less than the fourth quarter than the third quarter. My understanding that's some asset sales, but the same-store revenue sequentially was flat versus the third quarter. I'm curious as to why there was such a major drop in that line item from about $180 million to about $175.5 million in the fourth quarter.","Keith Kimmel","Hey Rich, it's Keith. I'll start with the flat sequential and then I'll turn it over to Paul to add the broader look. So when you look at our sequential revenue, while it was flat from Q3 to Q4, what's important to know is there's really two components in there. The first one being our net rental income, which is all of our occupancy, our rental rates and that particular piece actually grew by 1% quarter-over-quarter that was offset by a number of lower transactions, and transaction income from move-outs and move-in fees, application fees, things of that nature, we would describe that as good, bad news. We retained more residents and had less of that activity that offset it that flattened it out. But if you go to the core of the business, it actually grew 1%. Paul, would you add to that?","Paul Beldin","That's exactly as I would articulate it, Keith that the one item that I would add is that that decline was expected and it's consistent with what Keith has been talking about, the kind of too modest to repeat here. And that it's really a function of our operating philosophy. And the fact that we're getting customers who are staying with us longer and who are less apt to create charges that are non-recurring and not necessarily good news, like late fees and cleaning and damage costs.","Rich Anderson","So a bigger picture question for Terry, and maybe drafting off of Haendel's question a little bit, maybe bigger picture. I'm sure you've heard it, the mezz deal and Brickell, and even Indigo a few years ago or whenever it was, are somewhat complex in nature, Indigo's worked out for you. These two are [TBD], and people thinking while this is perhaps the Aimco of old, complex stuff and all that sort of stuff. So I thought I'd give you the stage on this conference call to see how you feel about that response. And whether or not is there a bigger pipeline of more complicated transactions ahead, or are these somewhat one off and it should not be viewed as sort of a return to a more complicated revenue stream that we recall back many years ago?","Terry Considine","Rich, thank you very much. I guess I'd like to start by hooking onto your insight that congratulations of lower revenue. In fact, that comes from simplification. And in fact, it comes from our focus, not on top-line or bad activity but on contribution and margin. So I think that we are going to stay completely focused on cash and value creation and optionality.","And I think that in a market that is as competitive as the current market where there is lots of capital, lots of new supply, it's very important for us as a company to maintain that kind of focus, which to give Keith another pat on the back, has resulted in operating expenses excluding taxes being flat for more than a decade. So I'm not particularly worried about us getting off track. Those are just built into our culture and our discipline.","And looking at particular investments to arrive at those goals, we're going to be opportunistic. The amount of opportunity to buy fully marketed deals in a very competitive market is not particularly attractive. And so we will look for deals that have additional optionality that will lead us to these same goals that we've been describing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","My question on Parkmerced. Has it recently kind of -- at first occupancy, how is the rate achievement on that and kind of the pace of that going relative to your expectations? And I guess, has there been any change to the expected stabilized yield on that, or kind of your development pipeline as a whole, based on what you're seeing in the market?","Wes Powell","Drew, it's Wes. I'll take a first stab and then turn it over to Keith on some details on the lease up there. But we feel great about Parc Mosaic in Boulder, as you may know, it's a market that is continuing to add jobs at a rapid clip. And pricing has been better than expectation, and we feel that as we move into this year, it will be better yet. In terms of the yields on that, I think we've talked about a range between 5.5 and 6, but its early days, and we're not quite sure where it's going to stabilize. But we feel very good about the spread of where that would trade today, may be a 4, or sub-4 cap rate market. But Keith, any additional color?","Keith Kimmel","Drew, just share sort of the absorption and how it's being received in the market. We were now three buildings that have been delivered. We're approaching 60% pre-leased on those units, we are better than 50% occupied. To give you a context, we just started delivering the fourth building will be coming soon, and the rates have been right on par, if not, a little bit better, and we're ready to get into peak season, where we think it will be our greatest strength.","Drew Babin","Okay. Then I guess more generally, the rest of your development pipeline, the ground-up projects, where do those currently stand on kind of expected yield basis? Maybe give an update there?","Wes Powell","Drew, it's Wes again. Again on all of those that are in kind of early days, but the range there is generally going to be 150 to 200 plus basis points ahead, of whatever the cap rate in those markets is. So it's for us, looking at the factors of the submarket. So Fremont for example, which is I believe a mid 6 stabilization. But we think again based on early pricing, it could be better than that. The Leahy, which is in Redwood City, will be north of 5. But again, that's different markets. So I'd say overall, we feel very good about where pricing is coming in, where demand is coming in, and as those get past kind of a critical mass of lease-up, we will give you a better update.","Paul Beldin","And just, this is Paul. I was just going to add, from an overall perspective, we focus a lot on the expected free cash flow IRRs and for these projects, the returns are all between 9% and 11%.","Drew Babin","Okay. I appreciate the color on that. And Paul, I've got here, just one question on the debt maturity schedule. I guess quite a bit of secured debt over the years has been pre-pay opportunistically, and given the rates available in the secured market right now, probably still makes sense. I guess, can you give some guidance on how much potential debt gets pulled forward to be paid down this year from out years, kind of what's assumed in guidance?","Paul Beldin","Yeah that's assumed in guidance is the expectation that we have about a $220 million of our 2021 maturities that can be repaid at par during 2020. So we have assumed that that debt will actually be repaid, and that's one of the factors that is lowering our leverage. But we also continue to have ongoing dialog every week with our lenders, and we look for other opportunities to maybe prepay other high-cost debt. If we can do so in a manner that is net cash positive to Aimco. So if our interest savings between the time of the debt is prepaid, with a prepayment penalty, and the date at which that debt can be paid off at par, that's a net positive NPV. We will undertake additional refinancing.","Drew Babin","So to be clear, guidance just implies that $220 million, nothing else. Anything else would be opportunistic?","Paul Beldin","Correct.","Operator","And our next question today comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Keith, could you share what you're budgeting for LA Metro revenue growth in 2020?","Keith Kimmel","We wouldn't give you the exact number but that falls into our 2.5% to 3.5% range and that we believe will fall in there.","John Pawlowski","Maybe a bit more color in that market. I know supply is getting all the headlines right now. But what are you seeing on the demand side, foot traffic and then, what's the concessionary activity in the market? It seems to be slowing pretty rapidly in your sequential numbers, so just curious what you're seeing in the early innings of 2020?","Paul Beldin","So John, let me just -- I'll walk you through it. First our LA release broken into two pieces. So we have our Ventura portfolio, Simi Valley, and then of course our Mid-Wilshire in West LA. Not much supply or concern that really comes out of the Ventura piece. As we think about the Mid-Wilshire, we saw occupancy built through the fourth quarter and into January. So just as an example, we started in October at 96.7% and finished January at 97.1%, and so we believe that it's actually we're seeing good demand. There is plenty of sufficient demand to meet our needs and the fundamentals for us have been typically been pretty good.","John Pawlowski","And then last one from me, Terry just wondering your thoughts on obviously the balance sheet, how it's structured, there will never be huge financial distress to Aimco. But you would be an outlier versus your peers, in terms of being able to play offense in the next downturn, if we ever get one. So curious how you're going to de-risk the company a little bit, so you're not as much of a laggard, because you know, the Eds and Meds in the diversified portfolio resonate, but some steps like buying an office building in Miami, a mezz loan in the Bay Area that's not fully covered, those seem to go against the safe low beta profile, that does resonate well with Aimco. So are there any steps in terms of geography or balance sheet that you're going to take over the next few years, to derisk the company a bit more?","Terry Considine","That's not only a big questions that's several big question. So I'll try to be responsive, but if I miss one, please, please remind me. On the question of the leverage; let me just say, I feel very comfortable with our leverage today. I feel very comfortable with our goal, which is expressed in published guidance to bring it down by a turn by this time next year, and I feel very good about the point he made, which is just the delivery of these additional units that are in the pipeline, brings it down another turn.","So as the natural operation of the business will bring it down to a number in the middle, low-fives, which I have no idea where their peers will be at that time, that's a little bit of a moving target. But I think in terms of running the business, not to be comparable to peers, but to be safe and derisk it, I feel good about that. Particularly, of course, with our longer dated and non-recourse leverage. The second part of that is, remind me what the second part was? In terms low-beta, I don't know that we would say that our target is low beta.","I think there is elements of our business that are quite low beta. And there are elements that have great opportunity for value adds. And I would think that in general, I think Wes said in his remarks, we look for ones where you get both that you have the opportunity for deals you don't lose, which is low beta. But you have some extra opportunity, or potential that leads to -- hedge you win. And I don't think there's anything high beta about 1001 Brickell, which is a very stable asset in a very stable market, with good demand and so forth.","But it has the extra factors that it could turn out to be worth a multiple in terms of land value as opposed to that low beta asset. And so I would communicate to our shareholders that we think their expected returns are quite secure, and yet we also think there is an opportunity for something better to happen.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any final remarks.","Terry Considine","Rocco, thank you very much and thank you my friends for your interest in Aimco. If you have further questions, please do call. Many of us will be together in just about a month at Flamingo and on Brickell to look first hand at whether these are safe and low beta or not. I think you'll be delighted by what you see. And of course, many of us will be together at the Citi Conference in the following week. And so we want to be transparent, keep you posted in what we're doing, and we look forward to being together. Have a great weekend.","Operator","Thank you sir. Today's conference call is now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"1989":["Apartment Investment & Management Company (NYSE:AIV) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2015  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Lisa Cohn - Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary","Terry Considine - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Keith Kimmel - Executive Vice President, Property Operations","John Bezzant - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer","Ernie Freedman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Patti Fielding - Executive Vice President, Securities and Debt, Treasurer","Analysts","Nick Yulico - UBS","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Robert Stevenson - Janney Montgomery Scott","Dan Oppenheim - Zelmam & Associates","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities Inc.","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Drew Babin - Robert W.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2015 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as FFO and AFFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in-charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. During the recently completed second quarter Aimco continued on plan. Before my colleagues report in the particulars I\u2019d like to point out a highlight. In property operations business is better year-over-year and the rate of improvement has accelerated. Rent growth and average daily occupancy are both higher and operating expenses are down in second quarter and are up only little more than 1% year-to-date.","Keith and his team beat the high end of second quarter same-store NOI guidance by 145 basis points and this made for a good quarter and a solid book of business for the balance of this year and for next year to. In redevelopment are ongoing redevelopment projects are on time on budget and creating value about equal to $0.30 for every dollar invested.","Patti and her team are doing a great job reaching several milestones in second quarter including completion of construction on 2900 on First in Seattle. Approval of the next phase of the redevelopment of the Sterling in Center City Philadelphia, 97% occupancy at Lincoln Place in Venice California and rent increases averaging 21% at Pacific Bay business as we move past the initial Lisa. In portfolio management second quarter revenue per apartment home was $1760 up 14% year-over-year.","John and his team continue to sell our lowest rated properties and reinvest the proceeds and properties with higher rents and better prospects. And of course when we make investments we follow a pair trade discipline, explicitly comparing what we buy to what we sell. We invest only work portfolio quality is enhanced and the projected free cash flow internal rate of return is greater than net of the property being sold.","And on the balance sheet it was gratifying in a well-deserved complement Ernie, Patti and the entire finance team when Fitch upgraded his rating of Aimco to investment grade. For these good results offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammate both here in Denver as well as across the country to privilege and a pleasure to work with you.","And now for more detailed report of second quarter operations I would like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Terry. I am pleased to report with a solid quarter and operations with revenues up 4.5% year-over-year and 1.2% sequentially and acceleration from a result in the second quarter of 2014. Expenses were down 10 basis points year-over-year with NOI at 6.7% for the quarter both an improvement over prior year results.","Our residents continue to increase our marketing customer satisfaction. They give us better than a four-star rating for the quarter and we continue to see improvement year-over-year. As result when renewal rent increase 5.1% for the quarter we saw particular strength in Miami, the Bay Area and Boston. Renewal rents in these market increased 6% to 7% compared to the expiring lease rates.","For those leases expired and were not renewed our new lease pricing markedly accelerated throughout the quarter from 4.5% in April to 6.1% in May to June's increase of 6.4%. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 5.7% a 100 basis points better than last year.","New lease rates were particularly strong in Denver and San Diego with increases between 9% and 11%. The Bay Area had the single greatest result in new lease premiums at 20%. As a result of our team\u2019s hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 5.4% for the quarter, 50 basis points better than Q2 of 2014 all while increasing average daily occupancy for the quarter by 10 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially.","Turnover, for the quarter was 50.6% of the customers who decided to move out 25% were for career moves, 17% did not renewed due to price and 16% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these moveout reasons versus recent quarters or a long-term averages ","Our resident quality continues to improve the average incomes of those new customers we moved in during the second quarter was a 148,000 with a median income of 90,000 year-over-year the median income of our new residence was up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2014 due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality.","Looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up more than three quarters of our revenue the top performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% to almost 11% for the quarter, this was led by the Bay Area followed by Denver, Los Angeles and Miami. Our steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of more than 4% to better than 5% were San Diego, Boston Chicago and Orange County.","And rounding out our 10 largest markets we had Philadelphia and Washington D.C., which were up 1.8% and 1.2% respectively. Building upon our solid second quarter results the momentum continued in July, blended lease rates were up 6.1%, 50 basis points ahead of July of 2014. New leases were up 6.5% and renewables were up 5.7% July's average daily occupancy was on plan at 95.5% and August and September renewal offers went out with 5% to 8% increases. And with great thanks to our teams here in the field and here in Denver to your commitment to Aimco success.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith and good morning all. During the second quarter we invested a total of $158 million on our portfolio to redevelopment, development and in two acquisitions. We invested in properties located in Boston, Cambridge, Seattle, Center City Philadelphia and La Jolla California.","We expect from these investments stabilized average revenues per apartment more than $2900 three times that of the properties we sold to fund the investments and with higher projected rates of growth. Breaking down these activities we invested $45 million in redevelopment during the quarter the majority of which was related to our projects at Park Towne place in the sterling both located in Center City of Philadelphia.","We are executing both of these redevelopments in phases providing us with the flexibility to adjust as we go depending on product acceptance and competing supply. At Park Towne Place our current project includes a significant upgrade to the amenity spaces and redevelopment of the apartment homes in one of the four towers. We commenced leasing during the quarter as the initial homes were delivered and 40 of the 65 completed homes are now occupied at rents consistent with our underwriting.","At the Sterling 80% of the 156 completed apartment homes are occupied and rents are coming in above our underwriting. With strong results project to date Aimco approved a plan during the second quarter to redevelop an additional 103 apartment homes at the Sterling at a cost of $14 million. Work is also progressing as planned at our Ocean House on Prospect community in Ohio California and our first new move-ins occurred earlier this month.","Rental rate achievement to date is above underwriting during the last 12 months we have completed the construction and lease up of three redevelopment communities Pacific Bay Vistas is located in the Bay Area, Lincoln Place in Venice California and 2900 on first in Seattle. Pacific Bay Vistas which was leased up in the third quarter last year is 95% occupied today and second generation leases are being executed at rates averaging 21% above the expiring rates. ","Lincoln Place which Terry mentioned was leased up in the second quarter is 97% occupied today, 2,900 on first which was completed and leased up during the second quarter is also is 95% occupied today. And as previously reported, we completed the construction of the Preserve at Marin at the end of the first quarter and that community is 90% occupied today.","Overall, our redevelopment projects are enjoying good lease space and achieving rents at or above expectations. On the development front during the quarter we invested $22 million in our One Canal Street development in Boston. The construction is proceeding well and is now over 60% complete. We expect lease up to begin early next spring. On acquisitions, we invested $91 million in two communities in the burgeoning technology and life sciences hub around Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts.","We also committed an additional $15 million to complete the development of one of these communities. In April, we acquired for $63 million Axiom Apartment Homes, a newly developed 115 apartment home community. We have had strong leasing success at this property with 24% of the apartment homes currently occupied at rents above underwriting. Upon stabilization, we expect the average revenue per apartment home to be over $3500.","In June, we acquired 270 on Third and 91 apartment home community currently under construction just a few blocks away from Axiom. Our total projected investment in 270 on Third is $45 million which includes the $28 million acquisition price a maximum of $15 million in costs to complete the development, which costs are guaranteed by the developer and $2 million of other improvements and capitalized costs. On stabilization, revenues per apartment home are expected to average $2600.","These acquisitions are a continuation of our long-standing plans to upgrade the quality and location of our Boston portfolio, which is historically been concentrated in the suburbs. Pair trade discipline, we will continue to look for opportunities to zone Boston and elsewhere. The investment activity I just described as planned and paid for within our pair trade framework were proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties are reinvested through redevelopment and limited development and acquisition activities in properties with higher rents and operating margins and better growth prospects.","Consistent with this methodology, during the second quarter we sold our last conventional property in the state of Michigan with average revenues per apartment home of $876. And one of affordable property in suburban Chicago with average revenues per apartment home of $956. Looking ahead as you\u2019ll see in our earnings release we've increased our guidance for property sales to $425 million at the midpoint, which reflects additional asset sales to fund the acquisitions I just mentioned. We now expect to generate net proceeds to Aimco of $215 million to $225 million this year.","You will also see in our earnings release that we have provided guidance for acquisitions of $129 million which reflects our year-to-date activity. Having said that, we continue to look for opportunities to upgrade our portfolio through selective pair trades and if we find the right investments we will adjust our guidance accordingly. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ernest Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernie Freedman","Thanks, John. Starting with the second quarter 2015 results AFFO of $0.46 per share was at the high end of our guidance range and FFO of $0.56 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance range by one penny. Within these results, we exceeded the high end of same-store guidance with revenues 4.5% higher than second quarter 2014 in expenses 10 basis points lower leading to NOI growth of 6.7%. This out performance added a penny to second quarter bottom line with year-over-year NOI growth improved over 2014 by 80 basis points in revenue growth accelerated 40 basis points and sequential revenue growth accelerated over 2014 by 10 basis points.","Non-recurring income also added one penny to the quarter\u2019s out performance. At the AFFO line these items were slightly offset by higher capital replacement spending during the quarter as we had the opportunity to accelerate some second half projects ahead of leasing season. On the balance sheet as we announced previously Fitch upgraded Aimco to investment grade in June notwithstanding the achievement of investment grade by S&P earlier this year and now Fitch. We remain committed to continuing to improve our balance sheet by reducing leverage further and increasing the size of our unencumbered pool.","Today, our unencumbered pool includes 23 communities valued at $1.5 billion. On investment grade rating allows for future consideration of the use of corporate debt the Aimco does not anticipate doing so. Property debt markets continue to be deep and liquid, life companies and banks are aggressively pursuing opportunities to put capital to work in the multifamily space.","Particularly for high quality assets and are more competitive than the GSE's as an example when we refinanced a $170 million loan for Palazzo property in West Los Angeles during the quarter we received 15 bids and ultimately closed the 10-year loan with a life company at a rate of 3.5%.","As we look ahead to the balance of the year in operations we've increased our full-year same-store revenue growth projection to reflect our results to date and the strength we see for the balance of the year. We now anticipate same-store revenue growth between 4.25 and 4.75%. On the expense side we are reducing our expense growth projections to a range of 2% to 2.5%. With these expectations we now project full year NOI growth of 5% to 6%.","For the third quarter we are projecting NOI to increase 4.5% to 5.5% compared to the third quarter of last year into decreased 25 basis to 125 basis points compared to this most recently completed quarter. After earnings we have established third quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.54 to $0.58 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.43 to $0.47 per share.","We\u2019ve increased both full-year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance. The increase takes into account both our second quarter out performance and expectations for improved operating results for the remainder of the year. Offset somewhat by the impact of increased dispositions to fund completed and committed investment activities. Details and updates of all of our guidance metrics can be found on Page 5 of our earnings release.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I will turn it over to you for the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico, UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. If I look at your same-store guidance specifically on the at the same-store revenue guidance for the year basically you know implies you could do about the same in the back half years you\u2019re gone year-to-date about 4.5%. So you talk a bit about things accelerating it seems like that points to accelerating I mean you guys just being a bit conservative here as you look out the back half for the year?","Terry Considine","Nick, we give a guidance range certainly see from that range there is a possibility that there will be some further modest acceleration that of course show there is an opportunity for the deceleration. We increased guidance now twice this year from when we started were hopeful that will be able to have a similar discussion with you and everyone else next quarter, but as we see things right now we think puts us in a pretty good shape to consider continue to have good revenue growth that's better than we saw last year. And if the things keep trending like we saw on July which was better than July last year and June which is there June last year that certainly would give us an opportunities slightly better in aim towards the higher end of our guidance range.","Nick Yulico","Okay got it and then on Lincoln Place now that you know basically stabilize that asset. Can you tell us what the yield you\u2019ve now achieved on that I think a year ago you're saying you expect about 5.25 yields? Maybe if you could talk about where it is today and how much you seen rents grow and that sub market in the last year?","Terry Considine","Yes couple things I will mention there importantly Nick on Lincoln Place occupancies stabilize at this point revenue is not. We just finished construction here in the first quarter of this year and finished the lease up in the second quarter of this year and is we\u2019re doing the math at lease up we expected in our experience with other redevelopment so we have some great rent bombs as we go to second, third, and fourth generation leases. As I saw make that clear that from an occupancy standpoint we are stabilized but certainly not from the revenue standpoint.","So that in mind Nick based on today's rents not trended rents into the future. Based on today's rents so there is going to be more upside likely than I'm about to tell you. Right now what we project Lincoln Place at about 5.5 you know mid-5s stabilized yield and of course as we get these greater increases and get the stabilization from revenue standpoint and we get market growth over the next period of time will be even better still likely. And in terms of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace stay at the strong market I will ask Keith just to comment specifically about what you seen in the market specifically in Venice.","Keith Kimmel","I Nick its Keith, one of the things that we're excited about is that as we stabilize the went through the lease up our completion is that we were head of our plan and it would happen sooner than we anticipated which I think is a strong reflection on what\u2019s happening in Venice in that particular submarket, there's a lot of technology that is in that area that Google has been moving in a lot of the employees in Snapchat and others that are helping us see great acceleration not just on the occupancy front. But also we have confidence on the rate front.","Nick Yulico","And is that I mean I think that\u2019s now, just one of the question on Lincoln Place. I think that\u2019s your largest asset is that a candidate eventually for maybe a JV just to demonstrate in the market the type of pricing you could get on that - on that type of strong pricing on that asset?","Terry Considine","Nick, its Terry. It certainly would be a wonderful candidate for a JV, there is a lot of institutional interest in investing with Aimco or in an asset of that quality. We have to consider various elements of friction including the impact on prop 13, property taxes and whether or not we want to sell such a important core asset.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, guys.","Terry Considine","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks for the recent acquisitions and lease up in construction how do you weigh the risks of these deals versus acquiring stabilized assets?","John Bezzant","Nick, its John you know we weigh them against we look at lease up risk together with development risk where we have a little bit of development risk that is guaranteed by the developer on the 270 on third deal, that we are paying for that over the life of the project. ","But really factor that into our IRR calculations and so that it factors in through lease up timing and rate and expected rate growth are typical underwrite that we use on everything as a forward look using the market growth rates. And we look for a return on an asset like that that would be somewhere in the 50 basis point, 50 to 75 basis points ahead up on a completed asset ahead of what we would want for one that was stabilized and already done.","Nicholas Joseph","Okay thanks. And then you\u2019ve done a good job of improving the portfolio and the free cash flow margins. I mean this court you mentioned selling the asset and was that in 83 NOI cap rate, what percentage of the current conventional portfolio do you think would still trade at about a 7 NOI cap rate today?","John Bezzant","Very little, I don\u2019t have an exact percentage that I would give you I would tell you that from an asset standpoint we\u2019re down to a handful that our rents that are right around a thousand dollars a door. I think there are five of them in the portfolio that are just below thousand dollars. Generally that rent level is somewhat indicative of the markets of the property is in and the cap rate at which it would trade I don't think you'll see another eight handle this was a - this was Michigan and it was suburban Grand Rapids.","And so I would tell you five or six assets that are I am not even going to speak to seven handle, because I think lot of them could sell in with a six assets.","Nicholas Joseph","And with those five or six assets be the disposition candidates over the next call it 18 months?","John Bezzant","They are in our pool. Yes, they are certainly in our pool and there are others that were higher rates that are in the pool as well you know but ultimately what it comes down to for that disposition driver part of it is the funding of our development redevelopment activities as we look into 2016 and part of it is our pair trades and what we see on the pair trade side.","We continue to look and did transactions but they got to make sense as they trade for what we already own. We are fully invested in real estate today and want to continue to be fully invested if we see a chance invest in better real estate at better returns make the trade.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Rob Stevenson at Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. Keith your DC market benefited by about 110 basis points sequential occupancy gain, can you just talk about what you have seen there month over month over the last two or three months any real signs of traction still sort of bumping along the bottom. How would you characterize that today?","Keith Kimmel","Rob thanks for the question. I mean we are definitely in recovery mode I mean we\u2019re feeling better than we have quite some time. I will give you a little color on the different markets suburban Maryland and suburban Virginia we\u2019re at. We are seeing more strength in suburban Maryland and suburban Virginia specifically in the Alexandria markets, there is still some inventory that work our way through.","But I just as a reference point as we think about new lease rates you know in April we\u2019re hovering a little bit below flat and we've accelerated every month from May 27 all the way to July at 39 as an example, so we are seeing some strength are starting to happen there, we need to get ahead of ourselves because there are still more work to be done, but we are feeling better.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then you guys go through in our earnings release I guess a number of quarters now and sort of talk about what constitutes A, B and C plus in your portfolio. Once the rough breakdown today in those three buckets of the conventional portfolio?","John Bezzant","Sure, this is John. On the A side it is right around 45%, 46%, B\u2019s are 34%, 35% and C plus is the remainder.","Robert Stevenson","Thanks guys.","Terry Considine","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Oppenheim, Zelmam & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the expenses and expectations for the third quarter I think as you talk about the guidance for the third quarter NOI growth certainly seems strong in the revenue side, should we expect to see some of the revenues so the expenses come back to a more normal level rather than the slight decline that was on the second quarter?","Ernie Freedman","Dan, this is Ernie. Yes, you\u2019ll see expenses it will get probably in the third quarter slightly higher than we are running year-to-date, we\u2019ve a tougher comp in the fourth quarter and so we\u2019ve a tougher comp in the second half overall. The expectations are for higher expense growth in the second half. Most of that is fourth quarter and I think in the third quarter you\u2019ll a number in the 2-ish range and you\u2019ll see a number higher than that in the fourth quarter and though they have more difficult comp comparing to fourth quarter to fourth quarter year-over-year.","Dan Oppenheim","Okay. And then I guess in terms of the products in Philadelphia if we \u2013 on JFK the Sterling there in terms of the \u2013 what sort of yield are you thinking about there clearly as you are including more units or it\u2019s just that you're doing better than expected what type of yield think you end up getting on that?","Terry Considine","That project is one of our better projects to date in terms of what we are achieving not only just what our underwriting expectations are we betting underwriting in terms of yield and it would be north of a 6% for us likely at least what we\u2019ve seen to date and that\u2019s one of the main reason we're confident to put another 103 apartment homes into the pipeline on that one. And if that continues to go we\u2019ve the opportunity to do another eight to 10 floors or so the remaining and will be an important part of our 2016 contribution to redevelopment.","Dan Oppenheim","Great, thanks.","Ernie Freedman","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Your next question is from Rich Anderson at Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","Thank you and good morning, or afternoon. So I understand that pair trade concept is very clear the way you presented and I also understanding Aimco probably the portfolio offers more in a way redevelopments and other of the public REITs, but I guess the question is other people or other REITs are expressing a fair amount of concern and hesitation about investing in this market as it gets more and more expensive both land costs and actual properties. So could you ever see a time where your sales will significantly outpace at commensurate level of acquisition or redevelopment activity as this sort of environment unfolds?","Terry Considine","Rich, this is Terry. First of all I agree with your analysis I think that the market \u2013 many market assets are fully priced and this would not be a time when we would be inclined or quote by the market and in John's work he is focused more on anomalies if you will rather than on buying a particular market, particular asset at market pricing and so he looks for circumstances where we think there's something that's missed or where we can add some particular value.","Without that we\u2019re not likely to buy assets from others. In terms of whether or not we would continue to sell and hold the proceeds and cash or use them for further de-levering those are the possibilities we consider. Generally, our predisposition is to stay fully invested in real estate that\u2019s what we\u2019re hired to do and not to be asynchronous if you will in selling today with the prospect of investing in a future tomorrow that through circumstances we don't know.","Richard Anderson","Okay, great. And then second question maybe a comment on the market for new supply as it relates to your portfolio I think many of the REITs also are being hesitant about in some cases starting new development activity, but I think the United States leads the world and people that are both rich and stupid. And so there will be plenty of new supply that will come online even in that environment were seeing that to some degree. So I'm curious what you think about new supply in your markets and how it might impact Aimco differently than others potentially?","Terry Considine","Rich I will start and then hand about John who\u2026","Richard Anderson","By the way apologies for all the stupid people listen on the call.","Terry Considine","I think you're right to focus of new supply. We\u2019re in a time of wonderful rent growth, wonderful demand growth everything we see suggest little will continue but we know that the answer over time will be new supply and but it doesn't happen everywhere at the same degree at the same time. And so we track that by submarkets very specifically we look carefully at what our exposures are at our board meeting earlier this week we made a specific submarket by submarket report.","Because we want to know that what lies ahead. And I would say that the first answer that is to be the highly diversified and not have all our eggs in one basket and of course that's been a cornerstone principal Aimco and second for all us to look for particular locations and geographies such as our property in Marine County such as our properties in La Jolla where a new supply will be more reduced. So I don't John what would you added to that.","John Bezzant","Yes, I would just say Rich I think both your questions are really on point to things that we think about a lot and on the supply side of it as Terry mentioned we did do a report for board in the 40 \u2013 we track it down to the submarket level to look at it and look at deliveries over the next two years. And so on in this recent report don't have in front of me so my numbers may not be exactly I will give pretty close. In the top 40 submarkets were demand supply is going to be the highest in relation to existing supply over the next two years.","We have something like 3% of our assets invested it's a very small number. And when I flip it the other way and look at our top 40 markets where submarkets were we are invested. The supply pictures is pretty good there as well in fact 20 appears put a report out month or two ago. That we are the least exposed to new supply by his analysis. And we look at it - we don't analyze our peers to look at their exposure to supply but we so very comfortable where we said.","Richard Anderson","Thank you very much.","Terry Considine","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt at KeyBanc.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hey, thanks for the taking the question. Just given the acceleration you guys have seen across the portfolio and new lease rates. Are you consider increasing turnover to capture that higher rent growth.","Keith Kimmel","Austin this is Keith. I\u2019ll take that question. Back in often from time-to-time and I will give an example that when you think about the Bay Areas an example where you see rents are moving at on the new lease side at 20% those contemplations come into consideration you with the way we look at us as we take a lot of considerations everything return cost of vacancy what time of the year all those different things are going on and this is where our revenue management professionals are work here really leading guide her way to make those decisions.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks and then just separately you guys considering any additional ground-up development today and then if you could just rank some of the redevelopment opportunities that you haven't throughout the portfolio?","John Bezzant","So it is John. I\u2019ll take the development question and then hand of to Patti for redevelopment. No is the quick and easy answer we do look at opportunities to partner with local development partners on new projects and but they have to pass or underwriting criteria and on a newbuild that would be literally from ground up as opposed to the \u2013 the two that you require during the quarter that one completed and one under construction. If we were to go to a if you will a virgin side to starting your return hurdles would be higher than what we talked about earlier. And right now we haven't seen any of those that are compelling enough to pull the trigger on. Patti on redevelopment.","Patti Fielding","On the redevelopment side look at the U.S. starting in the west we have five projects on California that were looking at redevelopment on. Starting the Bay Area we have 707 Leahy, which is a 110 unit garden-style apartment. We are looking at interior and exterior renovations there. Heading down to LA we\u2019ve got Palazzo West, Palazzo East in Villas.","West is continuing phase read out there, where we are looking at finish in the remaining 38 penthouse units and completing for its 133 which is another 406 units. East will be an expansion of the fitness and spa Villas is the full, can be with amenities and working on the grounds.","I'm heading down the coast to Costa Mesa, 3400 Avenue of the Arts, will be another phase and it\u2019s actually finishing a phase construction of it started several years ago, where we got 240 units, that we are going to see there. Heading to the Midwest Yorktown in Lombard we\u2019re evaluating a base project development that was built in, the original project it was built in 1972 and the partial renovation of its done in 2005 and 2007 and this will just be an expansion.","And down to Florida we\u2019ve Yacht Club which is located on the water in Brickell, it\u2019s unobstructed views. We got a lot of untapped potential at that property. So we\u2019re evaluating several options. ","Austin Wurschmidt","I guess what would be the top three opportunities are the ones you listed in the anticipated capital cost and returns on those?","John Bezzant","Yes, it\u2019s a little bit early for us to providing guidance with that specific, I tell you the top opportunities for us on redevelopment going forward are continuation of the phase 3 developments that we\u2019re doing in Park Towne Place and Sterling, so you can certainly anticipate a likelihood of continued spend there.","Of course we need to finish off One Canal in Boston were a lot of that work will be done here by the end of 2015. But there is still be some spend to go in 2016. Beyond that as we are further along in the planning on those and as we get closer to the start of 2015, we\u2019ll provide very specific guidance as to what projects may come what time of year they may come and what the spend will likely beyond those, but don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves on those.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay, thanks for the time.","John Bezzant","Thanks, Austin","Operator","Your next question is from Drew Babin, Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","My question. As you look through more acquisition opportunities and should more come up beyond what you are currently guiding to, should we automatically assume that will be matched with additional dispositions, just concerned, just my concern, but you know with these deals there seems to be bit of a yield spread between what you be buying and selling and it could come with the degree of FFO dilution. So how do you gauge, the growth versus portfolio improvement and the balance there?","John Bezzant","Sure, Drew, this is John again. Yes, each one of them you know each acquisition we do is paid literally against a sale, there we look at multiple metrics on how we compare that the most important one to us is our free cash internal rate of return we want to trade up obviously in an IRR. And as you note that could potentially lead to NOI dilution.","Generally speaking however when you're buying or excuse me selling like this quarter at a sub $900 rent and buying at a north of $3,000 rent the multiple there to free cash flow basis for us, we use a $1,200 a door CapEx expense number in our free cash model and our free cash numbers are really remarkably close \u2013 using the deals are bit of an outlier with the free cash flow cap rate up in the sixes.","But most of them are going to be high fours, low fives and we\u2019re finding that on a stabilized basis with on an acquisition those that we have pulled the trigger on. We feel comfortable, we pretty well trade across on a free cash flow basis.","Drew Babin","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And secondly you have something you just walk through the expense cuts that kind of drove the decrease in same property operating expense in the second quarter kind of walk through the marketing IT, insurance cost measures and whether on a non same-store basis whether any cost items were moved from operating expenses in the G&A. G&A was a little bit higher than that I was just wondering if anything keep the ready moving parts there?","John Bezzant","Yes, I only answer the second part of the question first round any movements and then talk about some of the deals with Keith\u2019s help on what happen in the same-store. Answer to your second part of the question, no there were no changes what happened with G&A in the second quarter that because we are tracking well to our performance metrics this year, we decide accrual to more bonus expense to reflect the fact that we are having better year this year. So that\u2019s why G&A move up and as you can see from our guidance we expect G&A to be right on what we said at the beginning of the year.","And so there I don't see any concerns and there were no movements from moving things from operating expenses to G&A. Specifically with in the operating expense as you pointed out couple of line items we did well. On insurance we just continued vigilance and watching things, we continue to have improved loss history and so our loss reserves continue to improve. We see in our health benefit claims actually have a couple of quarters a good guys this year where last year we had some bad guys and so that led to a large decline in insurance as well as our property renewal that which occurred effective March 1 were we have a very favorable property insurance renewal which we\u2019ll run into all throughout the year.","Specific to IT, Terry for giving me a hard time, but IT cost going up for the last couple of years so we finally being able to turn that around a little bit and be able to see some efficiency and cost savings to our administrative and software cost there and so I think that would be a good guy for us for the remainder of the year. Keith, wanted to just talk a little about [indiscernible] into our marketing expenses coming down.","Keith Kimmel","Yes, sure Ernie. The marketing costs some of the things we saw there really were driven by resident relations credit, those resident relations credits are generally used where we have something maybe didn't go exactly the way we hope it would. And so we\u2019ve had a very, very specific focus on customer satisfaction and the improvement of \u2013 and it was in my prepared remarks I talked about we\u2019re seeing better than four-star ratings from our residents about their experiences and we had less of those in this past quarter than year before.","Drew Babin","Great, thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Terry Considine","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Conor Wagner at Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","Hello.","Ernie Freedman","Hey, Conor.","Conor Wagner","Ernie, first question on the increase in nonrecurring income in the quarter and then for the year that looks to be about two sense is that the primary driver behind the increase in the FFO guidance?","Ernie Freedman","The part of that increase in nonrecurring happened in the first quarter Conor, so I didn\u2019t bothered to update guidance at this point we do get another a penny here in the second quarter so as you look at our increase we increased our guidance to send the last quarter, that was nonrecurring I just didn\u2019t update guidance at that point. The accumulation of those two items are now $0.02 so we updated our guidance we had $0.01 good guy in the second quarter from operations $0.01 from that the nonrecurring item you mentioned and then $0.01 also came from just a hodgepodge to other items.","The reason we only increased FFO $0.02 and not for those $0.03 that because of our investing activity for the rest of the year. We\u2019re going to be selling a few more assets than we had originally given guidance to. John mentioned that going to 270 on Third which is being built currently and will be finished here in the fourth quarter of 2015, but we\u2019re expecting no income contribution from that community on 2015, but we are selling communities that are generating income to fund that acquisition and then set the penny backwards that we move on FFO.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you. And then you mentioned earlier Ernie a bit of a pull forwarding capital replacements before the busy summer leasing season and do you have any \u2013 can you quantify any impact that have either a new lease growth or revenue growth thus far into the second quarter and as you go into the third quarter.","Ernie Freedman","Very little, it\u2019s our capital replacement spending we make an assumption around that because it goes through AFFO that we get very little if any revenue enhancement from that. It's always good to get a better looking communities and not. You can see in our guidance that we didn't also increase our expectation for property upgrades from $45 million to $55 million. Those items we would expect to have some kind of NOI upside to sometimes it\u2019s on the revenue side quite often it\u2019s also on the expense side so it\u2019s not just a revenue increase that we get from our capital enhancement project.","Good example would be our wood flooring, our wood flooring program helps us on revenue in terms of rent premiums and more importantly to help to save on capital dollars because the wood flooring last 15 years versus carpet which typically only goes for about 2 to 3. We also save some expenses from that because it's lot cheaper to mop a floor than to do a professional carpet cleaning. And so when we see those opportunities to enhance our returns, we would certainly look for those and we\u2019ve had some success there in getting those products accelerated to. So those are the two different buckets and how those can impact.","Conor Wagner","That additional $10 million that you now guiding to can you quantify the impact that\u2019s going to have this year?","Ernie Freedman","Sure, I\u2019ll give you the impact overall Conor, so roughly spend about $50 million a year on those capital enhancements and based on and not all that\u2019s in same-store, some of that is in non-same-store communities, but that will increase our NOI contributions by about 80 or 90 basis points. And so right now the midpoint of our guidance we expect NOI growth to be about 5.5% between 5% and 6% and maybe 80 to 90 basis points of that is from our revenue and CapEx which I know has been pretty consistent with what others report. We are also doing this type activity in their portfolios.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Wes Golladay at RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hello, everyone. Are you seeing much disparity between your A, B and C assets when it comes to rental growth?","Keith Kimmel","Wes, this is Keith, I will take it. We really like to use new lease price as the best barometer. And if we look over the past several quarters A's and B's have almost been on top of each other. With that being said this past quarter we saw B\u2019s taking a little bit of an acceleration they were about 200 basis points better than our A\u2019s and we always keep a close eye on it, to see how it progresses.","Wes Golladay","Okay then you guys have a lot of redevelopment activity on coming up. How do you balance using secured debt versus the flexibility of the unsecured market?","Keith Kimmel","Well, I am not sure, Wes I tied unnecessarily to our redevelopment activity are not a redevelopment activity. I think what\u2019s probably most important, when you're thinking about doing investing activity is trying to minimize unfunded commitments. And that\u2019s one thing that Aimco has done a very nice job under Terry\u2019s and Patti\u2019s guidance for so many years, where we don\u2019t want a get ahead of ourselves regardless to how we would finance things, and have too many unfunded commitments ahead of ourselves.","And so a good example is One Canal were 60% of those costs are were going to be funded by commitment from a property lender. We have a similar, we do our redevelopment projects in phases. So losses have flexibility that there was a liquidity event or some kind of concerns around the capital markets we could just stop and not committing to an entire project.","We don't have any kind of penalties for canceling construction contracts or things like that. Specific to where we want to be in an unsecured borrower or using property debt or using corporate debt it goes back to managing risk. And do you want to put the entire entity at stake when you\u2019re using corporate debt or do you want to manage it on an asset-by-asset basis.","And so we\u2019ve certainly made a decision, we have the flexibility now to consider other things and now we have the two investment grades, we\u2019ve made the decision and then consistent with the decision sticking to using property debt management [indiscernible] and we've seen as I mentioned in our call scripts, we are seeing cost as good or slightly favorable using the property debt versus using the unsecured.","So it hasn\u2019t precluded us from having the ability to \u2013 you want to do from a write-down perspective from an investment perspective we\u2019re able to continue to have one long as weighted average maturities in the space, flattery our maturities, having probably the most fixed rate and so lease re-pricing risk exposure and it worked well for us and we want to ultimately continue to bring leverage down a little bit more, but continue to stick to the gain.","Wes Golladay","Okay, you are more concern about get approval from the lenders and having any restriction on that, but that doesn't sound like it\u2019s an issue for you guys?","Terry Considine","We work with our lending partners and experts too very often quite excited about us going in. We certainly want to consult them if there is a redevelopment projects we have in place in their financing place there. As you know unencumbered pulls larger now, but that doesn't precluded us from doing I want to day close to a 100 redevelopment projects over the last eight or nine years and doing the one's we want to do. So that\u2019s \u2013 it certainly a discussion we have with our lenders. There are partners, but they like the fact that they are going to get it be a better collateral at the end of the day and so it works that well.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot.","Terry Considine","You bet.","End of Q&A","Operator","I see no further questions. This concludes today's question-and-answer session.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2019 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, Executive Vice President, in charge of Redevelopment; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer is also present and will be available during our question-and-answer session, which will follow my prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. I thank you for your interest in Aimco.","Last year was another good year for Aimco. We increased net asset value by almost 6% and economic income by more than 8%. We did this through property operations where key set Aimco records were occupancy and achieved peer-leading NOI margins.","We did this through redevelopment were rest completed two major projects and continued investment in this highly creative line of business. And we did this through improvement of the Aimco portfolio, not only through operations and redevelopment but also by capital allocation.","We exited the affordable business and made accretive acquisitions in Philadelphia and Northern Virginia, and we repurchased 6% of our shares at about a 20% discount to net asset value per share.","In keeping with Aimco's paired-trade discipline the leverage neutral buyback is funded by the sale of lower-rated properties. Half of the sales have closed the remaining half are expected to close later this quarter.","We also improved our balance sheet, safer because based on nonrecourse elongated leverage by reducing 2019 to 2021 maturities by more than one-half, by lowering exposure to possible interest rate increases, by reducing interest expense by $13 million a year, and by increasing financial flexibility and dry powder, by adding almost $1 billion to our pool of uncovered properties. Our total leverage remained roughly flat at just over $4 billion and we expect to reduce that by about 10% during the coming year.","We have a stable and cohesive team. Our international culture was recognized once again when the Denver Post named Aimco a best workplace in Colorado for the sixth consecutive year.","As the New Year begins, we expect another solid year for Aimco. We expect 2019 market conditions to be the same as or better than last year. Competitive new building remains a challenge in some markets, but the diversification of our portfolio provides important protection.","When I reflect on last year's success and this year's bright prospects, I'm filled with gratitude to my Aimco teammates. Thank you for your hard work to serve our customers, for your friendship, and for the opportunities we have together.","Now for a more detailed report in the fourth quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter-end operations. We've continue to maximize revenue growth to really focus on occupancy. The fourth quarter finished at 96.9%, 60 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2017. Occupancy increased each month for 96.8% in October to 97.1% in December, and remained strong in January at 97%. Due to our consistently high customer satisfaction and our focus on customer selection, in 2018 turnover was 45.9% our lowest on record.","We continue to have peer-leading margins in our same-store portfolio. Our fourth quarter NOI margin of 75.6% is nearly 200 basis points better than the last quarter and represents our highest performance on record and our full year result of 74.2% exceeded last year's by 140 basis points. This is due to our consistent approach to staffing efficiencies, process centralization, and automation.","Turning to our same-store results. Revenues were up 3.4% for the quarter. Representing 32% of our same-store JV, our top revenue performers with increases over 4% were Boston, the Bay Area, San Diego and Seattle. We had solid performances of 3% growth in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Miami and Denver markets which make up 45% of our same-store JV.","Our lowest revenue growth came from Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia which had growth of flat to 2.5% for the quarter and these markets represent 14% of our same-store JV. Also in the fourth quarter expenses were up 3% and net operating income was up 3.6%. And finally, for the full year 2018, revenue was up 3.1%, expenses increased 3.3% and net operating income was up 3.1%.","Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter. New leases were up 20 basis points, renewals were up 4.3% and same-store blended lease rates were up 2%. We saw new lease rates of 3% to 4% in Boston and San Diego and with the most pressure on new lease rates in Chicago, due to normal seasonality.","Overall, our non-same-store portfolio which represents 37% of our JV had results that outperformed our expectations. At our premier Philadelphia redevelopment committees, the Sterling was occupied above 97% for the quarter Park Towne Place is now over 95% occupied and is achieving rents in line with our underwriting. Our five acquisitions from earlier in 2018 continue to operate at or ahead of plan. And additionally, we had strong revenue growth from our premier non-same-store communities, the Palazzo in Los Angeles were up 5.8%, One Canal in Boston was up 6.6% and Indigo in Northern California was up 7.2%.","Now turning to our 2019 outlook, our top markets with revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, our Boston, Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. Revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5% is expected in the Bay Area, Philadelphia, San Diego, Chicago, Atlanta and Seattle. And we expect growth of 1.5% to 2.5% in Denver, New York and Miami.","Finally as we look at our January same-store results, we see a solid start to the year that track with our plan. The Blended lease rates were up 2.1%. New lease rates about flat, renewables up 4.9% all while maintaining average daily occupancy of 97%, some 100 basis points higher than 2018.","And with great thanks our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco success. I'll turn the call over to the Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President of Redevelopment. Wes?","Wes Powell","Thank you, Keith. Today I will cover redevelopment, development and our fourth quarter acquisition. First, to recap our 2018 redevelopment and development activity, during the year we invested a total of $176 million, announced the start of $122 million in new projects and completed construction at Park Towne Place in Philadelphia and Saybrook Pointe in San Jose. Two projects on track to create nearly $70 million of value for Aimco shareholders.","As we look to 2019, we plan to increase redevelopment and development spending to between $225 million and $275 million a 40% increase over 2018. Approximately two-thirds of our planned 2019 investment will be on projects previously announced, and already underway, while the remainder will be the result of new starts during the year. We look forward to announcing and providing details on these additional projects as approvals are gained and construction begins.","Finally, during the fourth quarter Aimco purchased Avery Row, a 67-unit apartment community in the Washington D.C. area. The property was constructed in 2013 and is located in Arlington Virginia, just one mile from the Key Bridge leading to Washington D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood and two miles north of the Pentagon.","We expect this $30 million acquisition to produce a free cash flow IRR of almost 9%, driven by the value-added by Keith's operating team. And while Aimco contracted to purchase Avery Row before the announcement of Amazon's HQ2, we hope this stroke of good luck provides additional benefit, given the property's location just three miles north of Crystal City.","With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks Wes. Today I'm going to cover our fourth quarter balance sheet and share repurchase activity, our 2018 financial results and our 2019 guidance. First, on the balance sheet.","In addition to closing the $867 million of refinancing activity we discussed on the third quarter call, we increased liquidity and financial flexibility by exercising our option to expand by $200 million our revolving credit facility bringing total capacity to $800 million of which $633 million was available at year-end and increasing the value of our unencumbered properties by 50% since the beginning of the year to $2.7 billion.","Now on the fourth quarter share repurchases and related activity. As Terry mentioned, we returned $394 million of capitals to shareholders by repurchasing 6% of outstanding shares at a discount of about 20% to our published third quarter net asset value of $56 per share, about half of the proceeds needed to fund the stock repurchases came from property sales closed last year and in January of this year. These sales were made out of premium to the values ascribed to these communities and are publishing in AV.","The remaining proceeds needed to fund the stock repurchases are expected from sale of communities now under contract, again at prices greater than their value and our published net asset value. With the completion of these transactions we will have created a $106 million of shareholder value.","The 2019 property sales are expected to generate taxable gains in excess of our regular quarterly dividend. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has declared a special dividend consisting of our regular quarterly revenue of $0.39 per share, plus $1.54 per share of additional consideration to be paid predominantly in stock.","The $4.5 million of newly issued shares will be neutralized on the ex-dividend date, so that there is no net change in a number of shares outstanding. This reverse split will ensure comparability of Aimco results before and after these transactions. Some shareholders may have more Aimco shares and some may have fewer based on their individual elections.","In summary, these transactions increased net asset value per share by 1%, do not affect our regular quarterly cash dividend which was increased 3% from last year, reduces by 6% the number of shares outstanding by reason of share repurchases, minimizes the aggregate tax paid by Aimco and our shareholders, is leverage neutral and results in no change the number of shares outstanding, as the incremental shares issued in the special dividend are promptly offset by the reverse stock split.","Now onto 2018 financial results. Fourth quarter pro forma FFO and AFFO per share met the midpoint of guidance at $0.63 and $0.53 respectively. Full year results were $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our original guidance when adjusted for transactional activity, with pro forma FFO per share of $2.47 and AFFO per share of $2.16.","As Keith noted, same-store revenue were up 3.1% for the year, 50 basis points ahead of our beginning of year expectations. Same-store expenses were up 3.3% and same-store NOI was up 3.1% ahead of our beginning of year expectations by 70 basis points. These strong results and our accretive capital allocation drove economic income growth of 8.5%.","Turning to 2019. We expect economic income growth similar to that achieved in 2018. We expect 2019 revenue growth through continued fair trade and the following operational expectations. Same-store revenue growth rate between 2.8% and 3.8%, earn in from our year-end book of business is expected to contribute 1.5% and higher average daily occupancy and blended rental rate growth are expected to contribute 1.3% to 2.3%.","We expect expense growth between 2% and 3%, with controllable operating expenses up just 50 basis points. And with real estate taxes, insurance and utilities up about 4%, leading to a same-store NOI growth rate between 2.7% and 4.5%.","We expect AFFO per share between $2.12 and $2.22, up year-over-year by $0.01 at the midpoint. The significant drivers of the expected increase in AFFO per share are $0.11 from same-store NOI growth and $0.04 from lower interest expense, offset by $0.08 of lower income tax benefit and $0.04 of net dilution from the sale of the asset management business.","As previously discussed, the sale of the asset management business and a reduction in nonrecurring income tax benefits create a headwind to 2019 earnings growth. However, the redeployment of capital from a diminishing income stream and the high quality apartment communities with higher expected free cash flow returns results in greater rates of net asset value creation and faster growth and economic income.","The percentage of AFFO drive from real estate operations is expected to be 98%, up from 75% just three years ago. Last, we have $0.02 net from other positive and negative changes, most importantly the loss of earnings from properties sold in 2019 to fund redevelopment activity.","With that we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Terry, you\u2019ve improved the portfolio in cash flow straight into your transactions, redevelopment, development, and then exit of the asset management business. Now you\u2019ve become more aggressive with share buybacks. If that continues to be a large disconnect between the private market and where the public market values the company, what\u2019s your appetite for executing on an even larger transaction in selling the company?","A \u2013 Terry Considine","Nick, as you know, the company's resale every day. And so -- and looking at any such transaction, we\u2019ll think about it as fiduciaries and what's best for shareholders.","Q \u2013 Nick Joseph","We saw another $11 million under the existing repurchase program, given that discount is still there today. Do you expect to continue to execute on it?","A \u2013 Terry Considine","It's one of the tools available to us to create value for our shareholders. When we look at our opportunities, both in redevelopment or acquisitions or share buybacks, we compare them on a consistent basis of a risk-adjusted free cash flow internal rate of return. And we'll exercise those that seem most accretive.","Q \u2013 Nick Joseph","Thanks.","A \u2013 Terry Considine","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trent Trujillo of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Trent Trujillo","Thank for taking the time. Appreciate the commentary. On asset, so taking a look at the list of assets that you have in the market, these generally look to be a little bit older properties. And I guess the exception at least from what I noticed is Atlanta. So it kind of gives the appearance that you maybe not preferring to operate in that market? What's your investment thesis on Atlanta? Is there too much supply, not enough scale benefit for you? Any commentary would we appreciated there. Thanks.","A \u2013 Terry Considine","Trent, thank you for the question. Atlanta is a very dynamic economy, but it's a very competitive real estate market and pruned to oversupply. And so we like our investments there and -- but we might -- for the ones we\u2019re selling, redeploy that capital to areas that have better risk-adjusted growth.","Q \u2013 Trent Trujillo","Okay. And I guess on that point of risk-adjusted growth and diversification more broadly. Something you talked about a lot and looking at your market concentrations, you have about 40% or so of your portfolio in California. And realizing California itself is a large geography. Is there any inclination to reduce your exposure there whether it\u2019d be by selling assets to take advantage of good pricing or any other means?","A \u2013 Terry Considine","Trent, again thank you. It's an excellent question. California as an enormous economy, the fifth largest in the world just by itself. And so having 40% of our capital there as a percentage of the economy does not give me any concern at all.","It does, however, have a single government. And so I think there's a certain political risk, which would make me cautious about increasing beyond that. And if we were to -- wish to reduce our exposure to the state or perhaps making another acquisition, and we should keep it constant, we would look at property sales or perhaps more likely joint ventures, which would preserve the advantage we have under proposition 13 on our property tax assessments in California.","Trent Trujillo","All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.","Terry Considine","You bet.","Keith Kimmel","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shirley Wu","So in Seattle you saw revenue growth of 4.4%, which is a lot higher than the lot of other peers in 4Q. Could you speak a little to the demand in that market? And what you're expecting going into 2019?","Keith Kimmel","Shirley, this is Keith and I'll walk through that. I think most importantly is a recognized, we only have two buildings in Seattle, one of which is in Belltown, one of which is in Renton. And while they had a good year, the impact is pretty minimal to the overall scope of things. And as we look into 2019 we'll look to continue with that momentum.","Shirley Wu","Great. Could you speak little on panorama in Miami? How's that billing leasing out and how's that -- share and concession for yard club?","Keith Kimmel","Shirley, it's Keith. I'll take that one as well. They just -- they have been leasing up for some time, but just recently started opening the doors thus far as moving people in. So it's -- what I tell you is that they were a little behind schedule; as we look at 2018 that benefit is us. And what I'd also say is our particular community across the street yard club is done quite well, even with them coming into the marketplace. And so while it's a significant lease-up, it's one in which we think that we\u2019re well-positioned and on the right side of the water as well.","Shirley Wu","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. Keith, which of your major market had the widest range of expected same-store revenue outcomes for 2019 when you were doing your budgeting? And what are the key variables that you think determine whether or not you're coming in at the high or low end of your expectations?","Keith Kimmel","Rob listen as we put them in trenches for you, we don't go into the particular markets of exactly how each one was built up. But what I would tell you is, is that when you look at our top trench, which is Boston, D.C. and LA, those are the ones that we have the most positive outlook as far as how they're performing today and how we think they'll perform in 2019.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. What other stabilize yields on the three ground-up developments you currently have under construction?","Wes Powell","Rob, it's Wes Powell, I' can give you those, at the three -- which is what we\u2019re now calling the project down at the Anschutz Medical Campus, we\u2019re going to be at about 6.25% there. The Elm Creek townhome project in Elmhurst, we're going to be little north of 7%. And at Park Mosaic in Boulder will be between 5.5% and 6%.","Rob Stevenson","Where do those compare versus market cap rates for high quality new assets?","Wes Powell","Generally, that's about 150 to 200 basis points spread.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could provide some additional detail behind the decision to buyback more stock than you could absorb from a taxable gain perspective. And then just also curious if the stock price move lower between now and the valuation date for the stock dividend, would you consider paying out 100% of the special dividend in cash?","Terry Considine","Austin it's Terry. And your first question was around the sale and triggering economic gain. At Aimco the fact is that our properties are worth a lot more than what we pay for them and then their bases. And so any active management in the exercise of capital allocation produces taxable income. And with that taxable income, we have a choice between paying a tax at the REIT level or at the shareholder level. It's vastly more efficient for shareholders if we pay it at the shareholder level. So that's our thinking behind the sale and use of proceeds in a very accretive way and the distribution of the gain through the stock dividend.","And as to your second question, no, we think that we fixed the amount of cash, we fixed the number of shares, and we think the dividend will transact in an efficient way.","Austin Wurschmidt","Appreciates the thoughts there. And then you mentioned 2.1% blended lease rates in January, I believe, and just curious how that compares versus last year?","Keith Kimmel","Austin this is Keith. And as we look at the lease rate looking year-over-year, they're pretty comparable. They're almost right on top of each other. And so what I'd really put your focus is on the occupancy. And so while we saw similar rates what we saw is really nice acceleration in our average daily occupancy.","Austin Wurschmidt","So, how does the 97% you mentioned in January, how does that compare versus a year ago?","Keith Kimmel","About 100 basis points over -- it's exactly 100 basis points over a year ago.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. Thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Curious on how you balance the moving properties under the disposition list and actually executing versus scale in some markets. So, taking the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, where there is just less concentration. As you start to sell down those markets, do you hit a unit count or a property count where at that point it just makes sense to exit the market in one fell swoop versus keeping people on the ground from an operating standpoint?","Terry Considine","John, it's Terry and I'm happy to take a cut at that, Keith could add. There certainly can be operating inefficiencies created at a particular scale. But those have to be weighed against the cost of exit and the price we would receive and the properties we're selling. And so it's just a consideration, but it's not necessarily the decisive one. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","John what I would add to that is that we take an opportunity to think about the uniqueness of each one of our communities and how we operate in them. And so while one could be in Minneapolis and be in a unique place, we also can apply unique operating platform against it, it gives us the opportunity to feel confident and operating in those spots.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thanks for that. And then final one, John, maybe for you on the transaction market across your Illinois footprint and there's a bill going to the house right now similar to the Costa Hawkins California to repeal Illinois ban on rent control. Is it \u2013 do you expect it to cause any hiccup in the transaction market as 2019 \u2013 early 2019 unfolds?","John Bezzant","Yeah. We haven't seen any \u2013 we've got properties and transacted one there just recently and we got others under contract. We don't see any impact from it.","John Pawlowski","Are folks talking about it?","John Bezzant","Not \u2013 it would not be high on the list. It's not \u2013 as we've put stuff out to market in Illinois which has been a handful of properties. We've seen a very normal market response to it. And much more interested in rents and rates than they are in, what's going on in the legislature.","John Pawlowski","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Good afternoon. When we compare your guidance assumptions versus what we had in our models. I think where we vary the most is just in regards to how your acquisition and you disposition outlook of more lower acquisitions much higher dispositions. Could you just talk a little bit about the strategic decision this year to be a net seller kind of what's driving that? Is it need to deliver the balance sheet? Is it you seen some really attractive price out there? Just trying to understand that decision process and whether you \u2013 that initial guidance could be prone to change of the year progressive?","Terry Considine","Tayo, this is Terry. I'll take a cut at it and then I'll ask Paul to cover any details that I miss. But I thought looking at your model that the biggest difference was around the tax benefit number. And I just mentioned that because it \u2013 2019 is a good example of why I rely on net asset value rather than FFO as our primary financial metric. And I think the most important difference between FFO models and our guidance is the reduction of tax credit income to the \u2013 due to the redevelopment of Park Towne Place and its replacement by recurring cash flows from high-quality properties. And FFO models the result is flat. But the critical ask question is what is the right PE multiple to apply to that FFO? The NAV model answers that question based on objective third-party evaluations in hundreds and thousands of actual transactions by buyers and sellers.","For non-recurring tax credit income, the right multiple is one. For recurring cash flows from high-quality properties the right multiple is 20 or 25, equivalent to 4% and 5% cap rate. So Aimco's guidance for 2019 FFO is flat year-over-year. It does not mean that Aimco's valuation is unchanged, and given the different quality of income, our guidance points to another good year for Aimco and for its shareholders. So Paul, would you want to add to that or talk about the specifics of properties being sold?","Paul Beldin","Yeah. Thank you, Terry. Terry, I think that covers very well, kind of the consideration of variances maybe from the consensus FFO growth to what we guided to and how we think about that differential. But when it relates to the question about, how we are balancing our sources and uses of cash for the year that $800 million of expected dispositions at the midpoint is used to fund on a leverage-neutral basis, our share repurchase activity which we are funding about $325 million of which in 2019 and then also our expected redevelopment spend that Wes spoke to earlier and CE investment. And so you take the sum of those four factors that bounces out exactly at that $800 million amount.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Hardik Goel","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the share repurchases looking ahead, what do you see as a good band in which kind of repurchase your stock? And if the stock continues to trade above that band what would the capital be useful in that case?","Terry Considine","As we've discussed earlier, we're focused on all of the opportunities to make accretive investments for our shareholders. We look at it on a risk-adjusted basis. And broadly we look at redevelopment activities led by Wes, acquisitions or buyback of shares. And we'll look at those based on how they -- opportunities present themselves, and we analyze each of them on a consistent basis of a free cash flow internal rate of return. And we'll pick those that are best for our shareholders.","Hardik Goel","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey good. I guess, its good morning out there. I guess, I'm curious on how the margins and IRRs are on what you're selling compared to what you are keeping the rest of your portfolio. Any color on that?","Terry Considine","I can answer that in general, but if you want a more particular answer I might ask Lynn, if you have that in mind? Sure. She wants to speak to that.","Lynn Stanfield","Sure. The properties that you're selling would be the bottom of our stack ranking that we do across the portfolio. Therefore, we're selling of the bottom. The free cash flow IRRs for those properties that are currently being sold are six or less, while those properties that remain in our portfolio are well above that.","Haendel St. Juste","Any color on the margin differential?","Terry Considine","NOI margin, Lynn do you have that at hand.","Lynn Stanfield","And I don't, but I'd be happy to follow up after the call with specifics.","Terry Considine","But broadly, Haendel, and I'd the like to hear from you. Our -- we'll be selling properties with lower NOI margins and keeping them with higher margins. As you can see from the margin that Keith has achieved which was 74% -- 76% in the fourth quarter, 74% for the year, he is operating at a very high level. But the ones that are being sold are the ones that are in the bottom quartile of that range.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciate that Terry. And I guess to follow on some of the earlier questions about the timing here. I'm curious when you started to think seriously about the significant buyback and planning for the mechanics of what you're executing here, the taxable gain, special dividend etcetera.","When you look at the stock chart over the past year, the current price isn't well as attractive as other points in time to potentially execute on this. So just, curious again, the thinking or at least the timing of why now? Maybe some insights as to how you and the board have thought about it or discussed it over the past year?","Terry Considine","Haendel, as you know, because you know the company well. We are very focused on net asset value and economic income. And we've been well aware of the discount of the share price to our net asset value per share as we calculate it. And as this verified by these sales we make. So the opportunity has been one that is something that we thought about a lot over a long period of time. What has changed is that we've been able to think through a tax-efficient way to do so. And that was only accomplished in the fourth quarter. And so that explains the timing.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, Terry. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nikita Bely of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Nikita Bely","Good afternoon, guys. On the dispositions, given the size of the dispositions you expect in 2019, what is your guidance assumes on the timing of these because given the size you can really swing things, whether it's frontloaded or backend loaded. So if you could just tell us a little bit about maybe what's in the market already, what's the process on the sole right now? Is it front-year related or back half of the year?","Paul Beldin","Yes. Nikita, this is Paul. Thank you for the question. The timing of dispositions, of course are subject to change until they ultimately closed, but we have already closed a little over $140 million in January. We have another in real round numbers $250 million or so that we think is going to be closed between now and when we report our earnings for the first quarter. And then that sums about $4 million. So about half of our dispositions will occur in the first 3.5 months or so of the year and then the remaining is split about like 25% in the second quarter about 25% in the third and the remainder in the fourth.","Nikita Bely","Got it. Okay. And\u2026","Paul Beldin","Sorry. Half of this percentage is like 12% in the second, 12% in the third and 25% in the fourth. Sorry about that.","Nikita Bely","Okay. I got it. No, it\u2019s fine. I got it. And what are the -- what's the blended cap rate on full year of dispositions for 2019, are you assuming the model?","Paul Beldin","The ultimate cap rate will depend on assets sold, it will vary, but as we mentioned earlier, we continue to sell off the bottom. And so we would expect that to be higher than the cap rate of our overall portfolio, which is about 5%. But it's probably not going to be too far off of that number sort of say, mid-5s is the target.","Nikita Bely","About mid-5s. Okay. Got it. And on the tax benefits, will there be any tax benefits post-2019? Will that number -- because I know that's expected to kind of trickle out over time, but I guess the 19 the last year or will that go to zero in 2020?","Paul Beldin","Yes. So we have guided to about $8 million of tax benefit in 2019. There will always be some changes in the ultimate amount of benefit depending upon the activity of our taxable REIT subsidiary. But the amount of change or the rate of change year-over-year should not be significant going forward.","Nikita Bely","Got it. So basically that $8 million is kind of a run rate that one can assume going forward?","Paul Beldin","Plus or minus within a reasonable percentage.","Nikita Bely","Plus or minus. Got it. Right. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is a follow up from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Hi. Yeah. Thanks. Paul, what are the known items today that are expected to drive any difference in 2019 between NAREIT and pro forma FFO per share?","Paul Beldin","Yes. As today, Rob, any items that we have baked into our plans. So we would expect it to be very consistent.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then what are you guys assuming for a weighted average share count for FFO calculations in the first quarter and for the full year in your guidance?","Paul Beldin","Rob, I don't have at the tip of my hand. But I would tell you is that, as we think about the share repurchases they will be obviously funded with asset sales which are dilutive, but the accretive benefit of reducing the share count outstanding is roughly offset. It's neutralized.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And right now like you have like 149 or so, is that right?","Paul Beldin","Yes.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Paul Beldin","Yes. And just to emphasize a point that we made in talking about our stock dividend reverse stock split, up on the issuance of the new shares in connection with the stock dividend, those shares will be immediately reversed so that stock dividend will have no impact on our outstanding share count.","Rob Stevenson","Okay.","Terry Considine","Rob, just for clarity, if $150 million or so is what's outstanding today, that's what's expected for the year in our guidance. And I don't want to think that guidance somehow is affected by what would be future decisions. As Paul points out, those future decisions may or may not be material to what our average share count is. But there's no built-in gain for some change in share count.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. ","Terry Considine","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Terry, so the use of the stock dividend is not new to you, right? You used to back in 2018 during the GFC as a way to conserve cash and pay upwards of 80% to 90% of that dividend in stock. So I'm just wondering, you talked a little bit about getting creative of having not done the share repurchases before until you came up with the structure. But effectively you're just distributing the gain as a stock dividend basically as a rights offering to shareholders. So I don't know why it couldn't have done that before. Like, what changed in the mechanics that made this more possible today than at any other times?","Terry Considine","Michael, I think, what changed is the use of reverse split that a decade, as you pointed out, we did use stock dividends and it created uncertainty and confusion, I think, in the market, because of the lack of comparability before and after. And so in this case, the utilization of the reverse split is something that neutralizes that confusion.","Michael Bilerman","I don't think the market really -- I mean, it is what it is, right? And I don't think having a reverse stock split all of a sudden negates what happens. I mean, it's clever, but I think at the end of the day investors want company to sell assets and buyback stock if there is that difference. But anyway, I guess, that's the unique thing that allowed you guys to execute it.","How should investors think about the tax implication? Obviously, I assume the dividend, whether it's paid in cash or stock, is a taxable event, right? So for those that are getting additional script, they would have to come up -- and if they're a taxable holder, they would have to come up with the cash to pay their taxes on the gain?","Terry Considine","Well, it all depends on their tax circumstances about which we're not expert. But as you all know, the vast majority of our shareholders are tax exempt or tax insensitive.","Michael Bilerman","Like if you didn't -- did you consider that aspect? I mean, as significant holder, just personally, you have to pay taxes, right?","Terry Considine","I am familiar with my own tax circumstances. And you're right, it's an unfriendly event for me as an individual in the sense of taking the tax alone. But when in the context of the value creation and the benefit to the company, it's one as a shareholder that I'm quite pleased with.","Michael Bilerman","Right. And it is the opposite, right, the value of the remaining holding.","Terry Considine","That's right.","Michael Bilerman","And the future should be -- you may have to come up with a little more cash today to pay the taxes on that stock dividend that you're getting which doesn't create any value from a shareholder, right? Just the right and so much more so on the ramp of what's left over versus than what you're getting, because what they are getting is just a distributed amount its like the rights offering for a company?","Terry Considine","It's really not like a rights offering because it's not capable of subject to being exercised. The company is not -- get any new cash from it. It's more like a stock split which is to say a redivision of something that's already existing. But the immediate reversal leads it back to a comparable unit for comparison before and after. The tax side is one that is different. And it's one that doesn't matter at all to shareholders that are tax exempted or tax insensitive and it's one that can matter to me and to other officers, other directors, other people that hold it as individuals. But in doing that we look at the bigger picture and what we gain and we think sometimes you have to pay tax on good things.","Michael Bilerman","I was just thinking about a stock dividend in a sense of that all shareholders as they hold just to get the same percentage of the firm that they held before right that's just more shares outstanding you're going to reverse stocks, to reverse that, but that's effect with the comparison I was trying to make.","Terry Considine","Correct. And I agree with that. I agree with that.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And is there any impact from 2019 sales that we should be -- would this -- is this been a reoccur again I guess at the end of the year potentially for this years sales?","Terry Considine","Nick I think -- and we've tried to describe the tax from the property sold to fund the share buyback in the fourth quarter. And so there is -- and in fact we're pretty current with our estimated gains. But we've also been asked two or three times in the call whether we'd do more in the future? And we said, we'll look at all the possibilities that exist. If we do so then we could have the same situation again. If we don't, it wouldn't recur.","Michael Bilerman","Got it. Thank you.","Terry Considine","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, I thank you all for your interest in Aimco and perhaps fatuously given that our last call came from Michael Bilerman. I just want to say we look forward to meeting a lot of our shareholders next month at the Citi Conference in Florida.

Please note today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead ma'am.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2019 results and 2020 expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's Web site.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, our Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President, in charge of Redevelopment; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are also present, and will be available during our Q&A session, which will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa. And good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Third quarter was another strong quarter for Aimco across all our business metrics, including adjusted funds from operation, which exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $0.02 per share.","In operations, Keith and his team are having an excellent 2019. So far this year, they lead all peers in same-store revenue growth, same-store expense growth, same-store net operating income growth, same-store net operating income margin and perhaps most important, customer retention, driven by consistently improving levels of customer satisfaction and improved customer selection. One impressive measure of their productivity, the compounded annual growth rate in controllable operating expenses has been negative for the past 12 years.","In redevelopment, Wes and his team are on track, creating value across the portfolio. For example, at Parc Mosaic in Boulder, they welcomed our first residents with rates and at a least pace ahead of underwritten expectations. On the balance sheet, Patty and Paul took advantage of low interest rates and placed $670 million of long-dated property loans at 3.34%. In the past few quarters, they've reduced the cost of our leverage and in the next few they will reduce its absolute amount. Debt to EBITDA temporarily elevated as planned, will be a half turn less by the end of this year and a full turn less by the end of next year.","With this year's leasing mostly complete, our focus naturally turns to next year. We have already provided our preliminary outlook for 2020. We see another good year with solid growth; with same-store net operating income up 3.7% to 4.1%; with AFFO per share up 6% to 8%; and economic income per share up 8% to 11%, to a year-end net asset value of about $63 per share.","We expect to achieve these results, notwithstanding our continued investment in growth through redevelopment. As Schedule 10 shows, we've made a substantial investment in assets, which are non-earning or reduced earning while the properties are being redeveloped. We accept short-term pain for long-term gain, because over the next four years these six redevelopments will be completed, the apartments will be leased and the properties will be stabilized.","After consideration of moving parts including capitalized costs and the cost of capital to complete construction, the six properties are expected to increase the run rate of the 2020 base case by adding another $27 million to NOI and $0.18 per share to bottom line. So we expect 2020 to be another good year. We are upbeat about the future. We're also prepared for a possible downturn in the economy.","By comparison to the general population of apartment renters, Aimco customers on average are older and more stable with higher incomes and better credit. We have a limited cost to complete our redevelopments now under way. We have only nominal maturing debt. We have abundant liquidity in our largely unused $800 million bank line and then ready access to more through our $2.4 billion of unlevered properties.","We like our balance of growth and safety. These results and prospects are the work of a great team. For all that they've done and for the bright prospects of tomorrow, I offer my Aimco teammates many and sincere thanks. I'm proud of what we've accomplished together.","And now for more detail, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter in operations, delivering sector-leading margin for the ninth straight quarter, we set new highs in occupancy, a solid rate growth and a decrease in controllable operating expenses.","Our consistent performance has resulted in sector-leading revenue, expense, and NOI year-to-date. We begin with a relentless focus on customer selection and exceptional customer service. This playbook leads to lower turnover, higher occupancy, avoiding costs and better margin. Based on more than 20,000 surveys in the third quarter, customer satisfaction was over 4.25 out of 5 stars. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter at this world class level.","Third quarter turnover was 44.8%, a 40-basis point improvement year-over-year. As a result, our average daily occupancy was a third quarter record at 96.8%. We accelerated throughout the quarter from 96.6% in July to 97% in September. Our strong occupancy translated to solid top line growth with revenues up 3.8% for the quarter. Our top markets with growth over 4.5% were Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston and Atlanta. We have strong performances of growth over 3.5% in Denver and Los Angeles. Solid markets with growth over 2% were the Bay Area, San Diego, Miami and Chicago. Finally, markets with growth over 1% were New York and Seattle.","Now turning to expenses, as demonstrated by our decade of cost leadership, innovation and productivity are core to Aimco. Controllable operating expenses were down 80 basis points in the third quarter with the decreases in marketing and term costs resulting from high retention. This was offset by increases in property taxes, leading into expense growth of 3.1%. As a result, net operating income grew 4.1% and margins expanded to 73.1%, an improvement of 20 basis points over last year.","Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter. New lease rates were up 2.5%, renewal rates were up 4.6%, and same-store blended lease rates were up 3.6%. Our strongest new lease rate growth was in Boston, Seattle, and Denver, and with the most pressure on new lease rates in Chicago and Atlanta. Finally, as we look at our preliminary October results, we are continuing our occupancy acceleration and tracking toward a strong start to our 2020 plan.","Blended lease rates were up 3.1%, 30 basis points better than last year. New leases were up 1%, renewals were up 5.1%, all while achieving an average daily occupancy of 97.1%, some 30 basis points better than 2018. And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President of Redevelopment. Wes?","Wes Powell","Thank you, Keith. Aimco's redevelopment activities remain on track and details have been provided within our release. Today, I'll touch on our investments and portfolio management strategy and also provide some color on recent activities.","As ever, Aimco looks to make investments where we can earn outsized returns but on risk-adjusted basis. Broadly, we're looking for anomalies. Most often, our investments are covered land plays where we expect the appreciation of land to more than offset the depreciation of our buildings. This provides the opportunity for value creating redevelopment. We have, and adhere to strict policies favoring the portfolio diversified by price point and geography, customers with strong credit ,limited exposure to entitlement, lease-up and completion risks, modest near-term debt maturities, and abundant liquidity, including cash and a pool of unencumbered properties.","We are cautious about exposure to ground-up development. When appropriate, we employ others to take on those efforts, for example, Alexandria in Kendall Square, Trammell Crow on the Anschutz Medical Campus, and absent an outright sale, this will be the case when we monetize the land value of our Brickell Bay Drive waterfront properties in Miami. We do not shy away from complicated deal structures believing that some complexity can reduce risk and\/or lead to higher returns.","Now moving on to portfolio management and recent activity. While Aimco benefits from a geographically diversified portfolio, our markets are not fixed forever. Year-to-date, we have sold four properties located in Chicago's Western suburbs cutting in half our exposure there. We invested the proceeds in the previously announced acquisitions, redevelopment and development projects in South Florida, Colorado's FrontRange and Cambridge, Mass, where we find markets with greater economic and population growth, friendlier tax environments and superior fiscal policies.","And with thanks to all of my teammates for their continued hard work in constant pursuit of value-creating opportunities, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thank you, Wes. Today, I'm going to start with 2019 results and guidance, then discuss Aimco's balance sheet and finish with the 2020 outlook that we published one month ago. First, third quarter AFFO was $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of guidance. As a result of our third quarter outperformance and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our AFFO guidance for a second time this year.","We now expect AFFO per share of $2.20 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.03 from our beginning of year expectations. The strong operating results delivered by Keith contributed to our increase in guidance and increased asset values, also increase in asset values or the value-creating redevelopments delivered by Wes. Taken together, and with the accretive effects of our portfolio management activities, we expect 2019 year-end net asset value of $59 per share.","Next, Aimco's balance sheet has abundant liquidity with $800 million credit facility that is fully available and a pool of assets unencumbered by debt valued at $2.4 billion. Aimco leverage to EBITDA, consistent with plan, is currently above target. We expect to reduce leverage by half a turn to 7 times before our next earnings call as we execute our remaining $300 million of planned property sales.","Now turning to our 2020 preliminary outlook. We published the preliminary outlook one month ago to find an early view into the expected growth beyond the fourth quarter. We preliminarily expect 2020 AFFO to increase year-over-year by $0.13 to $0.18 per share or 6% to 8%. We expect this AFFO increase to be driven almost entirely by NOI from our 2020 same-store communities.","Diving a little further, we expect same-store revenue growth between 3.2% and 3.6%, same-store expense growth between 1.8% and 2.2%, same-store NOI growth between 3.7% and 4.1%, and leverage EBITDA to decline to 6.6 times driven by EBITDA growth and $100 million reduction in net debt. Organic growth, disciplined value creation by redevelopment and development, and a cohesive team are expected to produce 2020 year-end net asset value per share between $62 and $64 resulting in an economic income growth of approximately 8% to 11%.","As Terry mentioned, we are mindful of possible changes to the economy and are well prepared,. Please refer to pages 6 and 7 of our 2020 outlook for Aimco-specific factors and policies, which are intended to minimize the impact of an economic downturn across all aspects of our business. Lastly, based on clean our annual plan, and as we complete the budget process, we will issue overall guidance with the fourth quarter earnings release in late January.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Rocco, I'll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","On your 2020 outlook, you basically have same-store revenue decelerating a little bit. Can you just talk about that dynamic and then your leasing spreads are up on a year-over-year basis?","Paul Beldin","So the primary decline in the rate of revenue growth from where we expect the midpoint of 2019 guidance to be at 3.7%, and our range that we issued for next year is really driven by the rate of growth and occupancy. Keith and the team have done a wonderful job picking up about 60 basis points year-to-date of occupancy. And while we see the opportunities to do better next year, it's not going to be at that same rate of growth. And so that explains the change.","John Kim","And just sticking to the outlook and the $59 NAV you have for the fourth quarter estimated. I guess it's like a 5% increase over the last six months. Can you just walk through the components of the change? I mean, it looks like maybe half of that was same-store NOI growth, cap rate compression, and NAV redevelopment upside to that NAV that you created?","Terry Considine","John, I think you've nailed it, those are the three components. What I'd tell you is that as part of our meeting at NAREIT in a couple of weeks, we'll issue a third quarter NAV and we'll have all the detailed particulars there and we can crawl through the specifics at that time.","John Kim","Maybe specifically you mentioned you assumed unchanged market pricing. But I was just wondering if you had actually put in or factored in lower cap rates over the last six months. And if so, how much?","Paul Beldin","So the unchanged market price is really more of a perspective look, as we are forecasting out expectations for our year-end 2020 NAV. The 2019 number is based upon current cap rates.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shirley Wu","So similarly on the '20 preliminary outlook your expense guidance of 1.80 to 2, could you walk us through some of the major buckets and your expectations for some of the line items like taxes, insurance, utilities and controllables?","Paul Beldin","Yes, Shirley, we'll get into all the detailed particulars when we set formal guidance on the fourth quarter call, but just to light your appetite, I would tell you that embedded within that range of growth, we have an expectation that our controllable operating expenses will continue to be well under peer average. Keith mentioned that we were negative on a year-to-date basis. We expect for the full year to be up about 50 basis points in '19 and we expect similar or better results in 2020.","Shirley Wu","So we'll leave at that. And going to your 1001 Brickell acquisition, could you talk to the lease-up on that office asset and your optionalities for redevelopment and the potential structure of that deal potentially?","Wes Powell","Shirley, it's Wes. I'll take that, and thanks for the question. First, on the existing office building, it's early days, but it's right on plan. In fact, maybe a little bit ahead of plan. So we feel very good about that. The bigger picture, I think it's important to note that our plan to monetize that investment is going to be based on the value of the underlying land.","We feel like we increase that value day one, when we combined the site with our neighboring Yacht Club property. And that land value is going to be based likely all a mixed use development today as of right, you can build over 3 million square feet on the site, and basically we're going to wait and see what happens over time and we're going to make that decision and be able to monetize that investment without taking on the risk of ground-up development.","And so there is a question of whether we participate in that, if perhaps there is an apartment component to it, that would be a logical place, but that's a choice for the future. And right now, we feel like we have a great position to earn a current return while we see what happens over the coming years.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Trent Trujillo of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Trent Trujillo","So Paul, and maybe Lisa or others, on your leverage plans, you said that that will be accomplished once you complete your paired trades, so where does that stand since you didn't sell anything in the third quarter versus what you previously guided at $100 million for the quarter? Is that just a timing issue? And I guess related, I'm asking because if I look at the disposition list on your website, I see that the Lodge at Chattahoochee, Chimneys at Cradlerock, and Timbers of Long Reach are no longer on that list.","Paul Beldin","Yes, I'll start and then I'll maybe turn it over to Lisa if there's any additional information that maybe I neglected to cover. The expectation of $100 million of sales in the third quarter was based upon our call in the last January. As we went through and scheduled out our sales for the year, those have subsequently been planned to move back I guess it was not something that we may be explicitly communicated, so sorry for the misunderstanding there. But from about the second quarter on, our plan was to sell the remaining $300 million in the fourth quarter. Those sales are proceeding on track. Pricing is good, interest is good, and Lisa if anything else you could add?","Lisa Cohn","You hit all of that and only thing I'd add, the reason those are no longer on the website, it comes right now they're under contract. So you're up to date.","Trent Trujillo","Terry, maybe a bigger picture question. On a call earlier this year, I asked about how you're thinking about your exposure to California, roughly 40% of your capital or portfolio, and you mentioned you may consider joint venture structures on your existing assets. So with rent regulation initiatives, some markets seeing softness, other submarkets seeing higher supply in the coming year, has there been any further consideration to that? And maybe under what circumstances would you view that as an attractive thing to do both financially and from a market diversification perspective?","Terry Considine","It's an important issue in front of Aimco, and my views today are the same as they were when you asked earlier in the year. We like our allocation to California. It's a tremendous market, it's a very large economy, very dynamic. But we like it at about 40%, which is where we are today, and I think that we would like to take some of our capital in California and redeploy it perhaps in California where we can earn higher return perhaps in Wess' redevelopment activities and the most cost-effective way to do that I think will be to sell a fractional interest which maintains the protection against property tax increases under Prop 13. So that's -- you have the game plan and we're looking at that every day.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Terry, maybe following up on California. I just want to get your thoughts on AB 1482 and then potentially Prop 10 back on the ballot. And then specific to 1482, if that had been in place at beginning of the year, what would have been the impact on same-store revenue growth in California this year?","Terry Considine","Nick, I hate to say I'm sufficiently out of date. Is 1482 the rent control bill that was signed by the governor?","Nick Joseph","Correct.","Terry Considine","Okay. Then I think that our feeling is that it will have a benign effect on our leasing activity during the time that it's in effect. One of the other bills, perhaps that bill also includes some provisions about fair eviction and fair termination of leases and so there'll be a compliance issue, there is a nuance around mark-to-market rent increases for, but we have a very limited amount of that. So there are some consequences. But it doesn't change our overall view of the attractiveness of California as a place to invest.","Nick Joseph","And maybe specific to the financial impact if it had been in place at the beginning of the year in terms of the renewals that you're achieving?","Paul Beldin","Nick, this is Paul. The financial impact would be inconsequential.","Nick Joseph","And then just quickly on dispositions you've been selling out of Illinois. Is that a complete market access or do you expect to keep exposure about where it is today?","Terry Considine","if you're asking me or asking Lisa, but in general, we think that Illinois has some very difficult headwinds and we would expect to reduce our exposure there, provided we get reasonable pricing. And so, it's always subject to a price. There are properties there that we like better and some that we like less as you would expect and we are as always selling off the bottom.","Operator","And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just what does the preliminary guidance assume in terms of supply across your markets in 2020 versus 2019?","Terry Considine","So thinking about supply for next year, as we sit here in October, really our thoughts are very similar year-over-year. As we entered 2019, we expected the majority of the impact from competitive new supply to be centered in two submarkets. The first was in the Center City, University City areas in Philadelphia and that supply has been delivered on time on schedule throughout the course of 2019. 2019 I think was the fourth year in a row of elevated levels of new supply and we expect that high level supply to continue next year. The good news is the pace of deliveries is slowing and so while we are in excess of 4% and 5% for the past four years, it's forecasted to be closer to 3% looking forward in 2020.","The second sub-market that we had some concern about entering 2019 was Mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles. And we had expected completions as a percent of new stock to be just over 2%, as everybody on the call I think knows deliveries have been slowed a little bit in Mid-Wilshire this year. And so what that has done is just shifted some deliveries that were expected to occur late in 2019 into 2020. And so that's going to tip us likely up above that 2% threshold that we use as a critical factor for 2020 in Mid-Wilshire.","Those are the two submarkets, I guess, there are our two particular assets. I would call everybody's attention to that we are monitoring closely in 2020. One is One Canal which is in the Bulfinch Triangle neighborhood of Boston, a couple of blocks from the Garden, and next year, there is a forecast of about 2,600 new units within that sub-market. So One Canal is going to have a little bit of a slide next year. And then the other community is our Calhoun Beach Club community in Minneapolis, where there is about 1,600 new units that are expected to be delivered in 2020. But largely, we're in a very similar spot year-over-year.","Austin Wurschmidt","With respect to the Bay Area, I mean there's been some commentary around supply across several of the submarkets within that region, anything in that region that's worth flagging as well?","Terry Considine","In that region, I'd say the one submarket that we're watching is the South San Mateo submarket, and so there are some new deliveries that are coming online there. Timing is very dependent, and it's kind of back-end weighted. So we'll wait and see. But as we execute our plan, which is the timing of the delivery of the new supply, we don't think it's going to be particularly impactful.","Austin Wurschmidt","I appreciate the comments there. And then, next question. I was wondering if you could walk us through the different components that gets, you referenced a full turn lower leverage I believe by year-end '20. Given the prior comments that I think you plan to potentially ramp redevelopment in 2020. So can you just give us some moving pieces there that get you to a full turn lower?","Paul Beldin","So half of that is coming in the next couple of months as we complete our asset sales and then the other reductions driven by about $100 million reduction in net debt next year as we just execute the plan that we've outlined in the preliminary outlook and then the remainder comes from EBITDA growth and so embedded in that is our expectation that our redevelopment spend next year will likely be in the $250 million to $300 million range. That's all contemplated.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Keith, when you look at your A, B and C-plus bucket, how significant are the gaps between year-to-date blended lease growth between those buckets?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, we really measure it looking at new leases as the best barometer. And so when we look at it, there has been about a 50 basis point spread between As and Bs, Bs slightly outperforming. But of course, it always comes down to some of those markets and geographies across the country. So it really isn't necessarily strictly that it's a B product or an A product, it can come down to an A that's in Miami, could be outperforming one of our Bs or vice versa to another part of the country. So, about a 50 basis points spread is really one to look at.","Rob Stevenson","And that's on new leases, are you seeing any type of difference in terms of renewal rate and\/or ability to absorb rental rate increases on renewals?","Keith Kimmel","No, we're not actually. And we continue to see that we have upside with the ability of our focus on customer selection and their ability to pay their credit worthiness and we have not seen any change in the way that they're able to absorb or take on increases.","Rob Stevenson","And then secondly, have you guys plateaued in terms of the various fees that you charge residents? Are there other opportunities on the fee front in front of you over the next 12 months to 18 months?","Terry Considine","Rob, I'll take that. What I'd say is, is that there is a couple of ways to think about the fees. First and foremost, when we think about fees that are associated with leasing activity when we run at higher occupancies, we see less of those and that's a good thing as far as we're concerned. Also with higher occupancies, we are able to get more parking fees, more pet fees, more storage fees and things like that.","Really what I think it comes down to is how we're able to promote those and create unique living experiences within our communities in which people take advantage of them. So I would say, well, I don't. I wouldn't say that's where we put, majority of our focus. In fact, it's a small portion of our revenues. It's an area in which we continue to focus on and we see in the future still opportunity.","Rob Stevenson","And how are you seeing the sort of smart home type of stuff. About half of your peers view it as a revenue opportunity. And then, half of them basically view it as an expense savings and not really a revenue opportunity. How are you guys viewing that?","Terry Considine","Rob, let me walk you through how we think about that just sort of holistically. We don't implement technology just for technology sake or some sort of whizz-bang. At the end of the day, we really have a couple of things. The first one is, is there a different customer experience in which if we apply, something that people will stay with us longer and they like living in our communities more. The next piece is how we can impact our team members and therefore having better jobs that are more rewarding or easier to do and ultimately being more efficient and more effective in how we do this.","And so when we think it's smart rent using that as the example, over the last year, we put 30,000 units in, we were out in front of the market and what we've seen is that our residents have a smoother experience, our service team members are cutting less keys, and at the end of the day, it really comes down to residents staying with us longer, team members wanting to have a more rewarding job and it's a holistic look at all of those things combined.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","I wanted to touch on Los Angeles, the delay in new deliveries in Mid-Wilshire that you mentioned. Should we take that is evidence that your fundamentals are holding up pretty well in LA. I know revenue growth on the books for 3Q would pretty consistent with 2Q and just curious whether anything sort of changes toward the end of the quarter, as many of your peers have reported?","Keith Kimmel","Drew, it's Keith, I'll walk you through how we're feeling about LA. I mean, I think first and foremost, we're feeling like we're having really solid year there. We've been in the top one or two positions over the past several quarters, this quarter similar. When we look at our occupancies, we're running in the high 96s and while we know that there are potential supplies, it has not affected us yet. And so what we're focused on is, how do we have residents that stay with us longer that we have a unique product offering in ultimately that we will have an advantage even if there is new product that comes online. But that being said, we're very keen to what's happening around us and we'll keep you posted as it goes.","Drew Babin","I appreciate the color and one more from me with blended leasing spreads, 3.5% year-to-date and presuming, there's not a lot of activity in the fourth quarter. But probably negatively impact that number before the year ends. How should we think about the amount of occupancy growth sort of built into the 2020 revenue growth number, which also implies some deceleration in new leasing activity toward the end of the year? Is there anything that I'm missing in terms of other income growth or on the occupancy front that sort of gets you more solidly into that 3.2% to 3.6% range?","Keith Kimmel","Drew, I'll start and then if Paul wants to add to it. What I think is most important to know is we solved the total revenue, and there is multiple levers that come into that that being rate and occupancy. And we don't solve any of those. What we're really focused on is how we have avoided turns, less vacancy loss, and residents saying with us longer. And so as you think about the 2020 plan, what the pieces are and exactly how we'll do it is something that I wouldn't specify right at this moment. Paul, anything you want to add to that?","Paul Beldin","I think that's exactly right, Keith. We'll provide a little bit of additional detail when we do issue formal guidance in January, but it is a lever and so it's a balancing act and what our goal is to not to maximize rate or not to maximize occupancy, but to maximize revenue and in turn NOI.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.","Hardik Goel","Just a quick one on guidance here, and I look at your guidance, it appears that you guys have set up to maybe comment a little bit above what you put out there at least at the midpoint. And then it looks like that'll set you up to maybe increase your 2020 outlook as well. Any reason why that would not be the case? I know you addressed some similar earlier, but just wanted to bring you back on that.","Paul Beldin","This is Paul. As far as it relates to 2019, entering the earnings release season, we already had a pretty narrow range around revenue for the full year. And we were very comfortable within the midpoint to the higher end of that range. And then as we look out to 2020, we feel good about what we published and we'll provide more details in January.","Hardik Goel","Maybe I can sneak in another one and ask in a different way. If you look to the high end of your 2020 guidance and the low end of your 2020 guidance, what would you say the probabilities are for those?","Paul Beldin","Hardik, I guess I have two reactions. One, I'd cautious -- caution you against accounting guidance, that wasn't outlook and when we issue guidance, we'll have more than likely they're not a range, a little bit wider than we published in the outlook. So that will provide both upside opportunities we see in the business, also allow for some downside risk if the business environment is different in 2020 than what we currently anticipate.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Richard Anderson of SMBC. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Maybe following up on that last question, if you were to, assuming that this business is all about expectations and performing relative to those expectations. Beating guidance is good thing for a stock market perspective. I'm curious like when you look at all the different elements of the 2020 preliminary outlook, where you see the best potential of outperformance? Is it on the revenue line, the expense line perhaps not because it's pretty tight number or on the leverage line? Just curious, assuming you've kind of done your homework and then perhaps stepped back a little bit to introduce some conservatism into the perspective, where that upside potential might be?","Paul Beldin","Rich, I'll start and we'll see if anyone has anything to add. What I would say is that we are in the midst of our planning process, we always see a number of opportunities as we go through that, those are opportunities that we as a team will do our best to execute upon and we are also cognizant that sometimes there is unknown risks. So we want to build that into the range of expectations as well. So I guess my short answer is, if we saw specific opportunities that we are confident, that'd be in our numbers, but stay tuned.","Richard Anderson","And then at the beginning of the call, Terry, you said balancing growth and safety, which I think we can all appreciate, but on the safety side, besides older residents, what is particularly safer about Aimco relative to your peers? I know you'll probably say a balance sheet that doesn't expose the enterprise to risk, but you start bleeding assets because of leverage that's not going to be good for the stock also. So I'm just curious what you think of, that's the stand-out from a safety perspective, when you consider Aimco relative to your peers?","Terry Considine","I think the first place, I'd start Rich, is with our market allocation. And if you go back and I think this is in the 2020 report, and just take our portfolio today, and look at the impacts during the global fiscal crisis, we have the lowest exposure, the lowest adverse effect, so just picking the right markets. I think the second most important thing is as Keith emphasizes again and again, picking the right customers.","We have very stringent credit and personnel requirements and we have more stable people and they have higher incomes, and they're just less likely to be adversely affected in a downturn. I'd say a third category that would get a lot of attention by Lisa and Wes and the people that are involved in redevelopment and capital enhancements and so forth is that the properties are well maintained. We have a high rate of capital spending keeping them in competitive conditions.","I think that once you have those factors in mind, and of course the just fantastic success that Keith and his team have in cost control, you have a revenue stream or income stream that is more stable, more durable. And on the balance sheet side, what we would emphasize most is the long duration and limited refinancing or re-pricing risk and on the need for more capital that we rarely start something without having the money in hand to complete it.","Richard Anderson","Okay, great. Well, hopefully, we're focused more on growth and safety next year. But I appreciate the comments. Thanks.","Terry Considine","Rich, let me just go back to it. We do talk about safety regularly at Aimco, which is built into our DNA. If you think about it from an allocation to B assets to geographic diversification, we're highly focused on safety. But that said we also are interested in growth. In our forecast for 2020, as just what Paul said, we are pretty upbeat about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","I want to go back to the plan to lower the leverage here a bit of I guess a nice surprise. Terry, I've followed the story for a long time. And historically, you've been willing to carry higher leverage versus your peers. In fact, it's one of the long-running differentiators and plays, well, it's long-term fixed rate non-recourse self amortizing. So I guess, I'm curious why the change in thinking here and then perhaps, would you go even lower than mid 6 maybe the low 5s like where some of your peers are?","Terry Considine","You know our views on debt very well, you recited them exactly right. We think and both credit agencies and some analysts and in fact reduced they give us a 10% benefit, if you will, reflecting those features. So first of all, we would say on analysis of the actual burden of the debt, just a nominal comparison overstates the risks to the business. Secondly, there hasn't been any change at all.","What Paul has talked about is returning to our policy target, we had a moment when we came out of policy, a combination of redevelopment spending and also taking advantage of interest rates at a time when loans were opened. And so we're a little bit higher than we want to be today, but we'll be down by half a turn at year-end and we'll be right in mid 6s at the end of next year and that's a place where we're comfortable being.","Haendel St. Juste","And then just going back to the business overall, you've done quite a bit here over the last few years, you've sold your asset management, your tax credit business, I guess you're going to be lowering your leverage here, I guess, what else is on your mind, are there any other key initiatives that you are perhaps at the border considering as you think about Aimco today versus Aimco where you want to be, say over the next three years to five years?","Terry Considine","I think there is a lot of things that are on mind always and we did just have a Board meeting where we talked about different strategic opportunities and issues, but they will come back to the same focus on the multi-family business and the same focus that the road to success is through satisfying the customer. And whether not we increase this in one way or emphasize it in different way, that's the heart of what we do.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Pawlowski","Wes, thanks for the comments on Yacht Club in Brickell Bay Drive and the thoughts there. I just want to make sure I understand the most likely playbook for both properties right now. Am I interpreting it correctly that right now as you see it today the most likely scenario is that you sell both the Yacht Club and then 1001 Brickell Bay Drive?","Wes Powell","I think that's exactly right. I think at the right price that is surely the best risk-adjusted return for us, and that's an execution we would do. And it's important to note that we like our optionality there and that we can run these assets over the next year or a few years until that pricing materializes.","John Pawlowski","And under that most likely scenario, what would Aimco's financial commitment would be? Is it zero with an outright sale? Or are you a partner in that most likely scenario?","Wes Powell","At an outright sale, it would be zero, we have cash coming in. But again, the option for us to participate in some future development would be based on what the plan is going to be and that's uncertain. And I think it's important to underscore that I don't see any circumstance where we participate in the development process itself.","John Pawlowski","And then maybe last one, maybe a bit of color on, if you put yourself in the buyers' shoes of that mixed use development, maybe stepping into, call it $170 million office building. So what is the mix of condos, hotels, apartments from your land? I'm sure you've done the math because that's your exit. What does the mix of units have to look like for a buyer's cost basis to pencil because it is an extensive rehab? A little bit color there would be awesome.","Wes Powell","What I think, well, first off, again we added value by putting two pieces together. So it's not just the kind of one site at the Yacht Club site, and then what I would say is, it all depends and I have no idea what the future holds, other than is there is going to be a mix of use, I don't know what the balance would be. I have no idea how condos will price in the future versus offices or apartments. But we think long-term waterfront property in Brickell is going to be worth more than it is today.","John Pawlowski","I guess the one question is you caught a $160 million check, you need to do some even if it's back of the envelope math to make sure an exit under today's pricing pencils. So I'm just trying to understand what the math is going to look like for a potential buyer of the site?","Wes Powell","John, I'd be happy to give you some numbers, but again, we guess this at this point and we have done the math. And again, you could assume that $1,000 condo prices, you can assume $3.75 or $4 rents, you could assume $60 office leases and all of those would put the value of the land at very close if not above what we bought the building for. But again, I think it's premature to try and pin down a number today.","Operator","And our next question is from Buck Horne of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Buck Horne","Just going back some operational stuff, could you just put a little color on the 10% year-over-year bump in property taxes -- in the same-store property taxes this quarter. And just what your outlook is for any tax issues for next quarter or 2020?","Paul Beldin","This is Paul. As you know, real estate taxes can be very volatile, particularly when you're looking at year-over-year changes in particular quarter because that year-over-year change is highly dependent upon timing of appeals being resolved, timing of assessments being received. So I'd really encourage you to look at a full-year trend in for '19 and we do expect property taxes to be a little bit higher than what our long-term trend has been and probably in the mid-6s and the reason for that is a couple-fold, one, you have some jurisdictions such as Colorado where they increase bi-annually, every other year on the odd year.","And then in other jurisdictions, we've had a very good fortune of having our values of our properties, JVs increased quite rapidly and in some instances, the assessors have been a little bit slow to recognize that increase in value. So we were aware that there is a potential that a catch-up could occur. And so, the fact of it has come through in the third quarter is not unexpected and built in within the construct of our guidance for the year. As we look out into 2020, we expect the a more normalized tax rate and probably if I were to put a number on it at this point be in the 4% to 4.5% to 5% range.","Buck Horne","Real quick on Flamingo Point with the retail and amenity delivering later this year. Is there any material income or any income that would start to flow through from that being finished up this year going into next year?","Wes Powell","It's Wes, I'll take that one. I would say no material impact on this year, but we expect to start to see a little bit of lift next year in 2020.","Buck Horne","Any rough idea of what kind of number that would be or immaterial?","Wes Powell","I think in the grand scheme of things and the overall project immaterial, but offline happy to give you some more color on it.","Paul Beldin","Buck, this is Paul. The gross incremental contribution is about $600,000 and it will partially earn in next year.","Buck Horne","And just one real last quick one, in California, any assets that'd be impacted operationally from the active wildfires going on, there's another one just popped up as well. So just anything any properties being impacted at all?","Keith Kimmel","Buck, it's Keith. I'll take that one in. We've had a couple of situations where it has been impactful. A week-and-a-half ago in Northern California, we had three communities which had lost power and this is where when we talk about our customer service we just think is really valuable. We had generators on hand immediately, common area lighting back on, and really how we can impact our residents to be there for them in a time of uncertainty that has occurred with those fires.","This past week, we had another building in Simi Valley, which is in Los Angeles. It lost power for a couple of days, exact same game plan, we had generators on site ready to help our residents. And we think, while this is an unfortunate thing and a challenge that has been in California for some time with fires and different things, our ability to insert ourselves is someone that has a unique living experience, how we can help our residents is powerful. I also just want to thank our teams in the field who were working day and night to make sure that our residents have the smoothest situations under a trying time.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any final remarks.","Terry Considine","Rocco, thank you for your help one more time, and thank all of you on the call for your interest in Aimco. Paul and I look forward to seeing you in Los Angeles in 10 days or so. And wish you a happy weekend. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you sir. Today's conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you, Amy. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2012 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that's part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Participants on today's call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide opening remarks; Keith Kimmel, EVP in Charge of Property Operations; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO.","Also in the room today are John Bezzant, EVP of Transactions; Miles Cortez, our EVP and Chief Administrative Officer; Dan Matula, EVP of Redevelopment and Construction Services. They are available to answer questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. The apartment business is good. The economy continues to mend, boosted by low natural gas prices and the early stages of a housing recovery. Better economy plus strong demographics equals solid demand for rental apartments. We expect favorable conditions for the next several years. New supply is increasing in some markets and may well slow down rent growth at the highest price points. This impact in our BB+ portfolio should be muted.","Buoyed by favorable macro conditions, Aimco is on track to execute its plans for this year. Operating team led by Keith Kimmel has done a good job in customer satisfaction, measured by a high percentage of lease renewals and a steady increase in renewal rents. The earn in of 2012 leasing provides a solid foundation for rent growth next year.","Keith's team has been superb in their cost discipline. Operating costs, that is before taxes and insurance, are actually down year-over-year. Our portfolio gets better and better. Average revenue per apartment home is more than $1,300, up 8% year-over-year. John Bezzant and his team continues selling lower-rated properties and investing the proceeds in property upgrades,  [indiscernible] redevelopment and a few attractive acquisitions.","The business is simpler and more profitable. With better properties and better markets, with fewer properties held in partnerships and with higher margins because capital replacement spending is declining as a percent of higher price point NOI.","Under Dan Matula construction is ramping up at all 10 properties identified for redevelopment starts this year. We expect these will add about $2 per share to net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so.","Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. We enjoy ample liquidity. Leverage is down by $700 million year-to-date. We expect year-end leverage to fourth quarter EBITDA annualized to be about 7.7:1, down 20% year-over-year. We are on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 15 months or so. In sum, we feel good about 2012, and we're optimistic as we make our plans for next year.","For more detail on third quarter operations, I'll turn the call to Keith Kimmel. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. So far in 2012, the revenue growth has been accelerating. Each quarter's year-over-year revenue growth has been greater than the preceding quarter. In the third quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.9% year-over-year, up 4.5% year to date and up 1.7% compared to the second quarter.","Let me provide some additional color on revenue. Third quarter blended rates were up 4.8%, with new leases up 3.8% and renewals up 6% on a lease-to-lease basis. This sets us up well for this quarter and creates a book of business that will earn in over the next several quarters and well into 2013.","As we finalize October, preliminary blended lease rates will be up between 2.5% and 3%, highlighted by our continued success with renewal rates up close to 5%. New lease rents flattened out, and we expect this to improve between 1% and 2% for the entire quarter, demonstrated by our second half of October building north of 1.5%. October's average daily occupancy was 95.3%, 10 basis points better than October 2011's result. We anticipate occupancy will improve for the balance of the year.","November and December renewal offers went out at 5% to 7%. And turnover was 46.8% for the quarter compared to 45.5% for the second quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention, as we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our costs down.","The top 3 reasons for move outs in the third quarter were career moves and pricing, both at 22% and purchasing homes at 12%. The home purchase number represents a 2% decrease from the second quarter. While we've also been tracking move outs to home rental, it's thus far been negligible. We continue to be successful in replacing move outs with better qualified residents and higher rents. We had 8,300 move-ins during the third quarter, with an average income of $99,000. The median income, $65,000, the rent to income ratio of 20.7%.","Third quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 50 basis points year-over-year, led by decreases in payroll and offset by increases in technology and also taxes and insurance. The net result of this was year-over-year NOI growth of 7.4%.","Let me provide some market performance details. 2\/3 of our revenue comes from 10 markets. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from over 5%, nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami and Denver. Steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of 4.5% to 5% were Orange County, Austin, Washington D.C., Chicago. Rounding out the top 10 markets was revenue growth between 3% and 3.5%, San Diego, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.","As you're aware, Hurricane Sandy had an incredible impact on the East Coast of the United States earlier this week. I'm pleased to report that all the thousands of residents and team members in the impacted areas are safe from harm. I want to personally thank the men and women of our property operations and construction services teams for their tireless efforts in ensuring stellar customer service in the face of adversity.  We're building upon the third quarter successes with a solid October, setting us up well for a strong finish in 2012 and beyond.","With great thanks to our teams in the field for a strong quarter, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, Keith. Today, I will focus on the following 4 topics: impact of Hurricane Sandy; portfolio and redevelopment activities; balance sheet activities and, finally, I will provide a guidance update.","We are quite fortunate and thankful that Hurricane Sandy's impact on our residents and team members was no worse than a significant inconvenience. They are still determining the extent of the damage caused by the storm, costs associated with it will include cleanup expenditures and repairs. The rough estimate currently is $1 million to $2 million in costs, of which we anticipate more than half will be covered by insurance proceeds.","As for the portfolio, during the quarter, we sold 22 properties with about 3,900 units, including 8 low-rated conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 5.9%. These properties had average revenue per unit of $795 compared to our portfolio today of $1,332. We also sold 14 affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.0%.","For the year, the NOI cap rate for our sold properties is 6.5%. The properties sold are among our lowest-rated assets and disproportionately weighted to affordable properties, as we accelerate our exit from that business. Average revenue per unit of the properties sold was $762. Our average revenue per unit for our entire current portfolio is $1,300 per unit. The implied cap rate for our entire portfolio based on our current share price is about 6.6%, higher than what we are achieving on sales.","As we reported on our second quarter earnings call, we acquired a property located in Downtown San Diego in July. We had no other acquisition activity during the quarter. For the year, properties acquired have average revenues per unit of $1,400 compared to $799 for properties we have sold year-to-date, helping to further our goal of increasing portfolio quality as measured by average revenue per unit.  We reduced acquisition guidance slightly, as we expect now that certain limited partnership transaction closings will move into the first part of 2013.","On the redevelopment front, as of today, construction is underway at 9 of the 10 projects we expected to begin this year. We plan to start the remaining projects, Sterling, in Center City, Philadelphia during the fourth quarter. In October we provided details around our Lincoln Place redevelopment. An earlier phase began last year, with the redevelopment of 4 buildings with 65 apartment homes. Work was completed earlier this year, and 50 of the apartment homes have been released to returning residents.","Over the next 2 years, we will redevelop the remaining 41 buildings, including 631 now vacant apartment homes, together with common areas and landscaping. We will also construct on now vacant land 13 new buildings with 99 apartment homes, a leasing center and a fitness center and pool area. This is an important milestone for Aimco, and we are eager to return Lincoln Place to an income-producing asset.","As to other notable redevelopment activities, the start of construction at Pacific Bay Vistas, our estimates for total project cost has increased approximately $12.4 million. The increase in anticipated cost is due to changes in scope to prevent moisture intrusion. Changes have delayed delivery of the property's residential buildings. The property's leasing center and community center have been completed.","In September, we completed construction of an exclusive rooftop patio and lounge area and other amenity upgrades at The Palazzo located in West Los Angeles. Redevelopment of the property's 4 penthouse model units was completed in early October, and we have started the upgrade of the property's 115 penthouse units on turns. This activity will continue for the next couple of years.","During the third quarter, we began construction at the Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera, California. We expect first occupancy in the second quarter of 2013, as stabilized rents are expected to average $3,880 per unit, not including interim market  [indiscernible] growth.","Including amounts spent to date, we expect to invest a total of $400 million over the next 2 to 3 years in the redevelopment of the 7 projects detailed in our supplemental schedules as well as 2 projects in Philadelphia and 1 in Seattle. Our anticipated investment in redevelopment for 2012 is now $100 million or about $35 million less than our previously provided guidance. The decrease provided us the opportunity to increase our investment in property upgrades by $20 million.","Regarding the balance sheet, as we reported last quarter, we redeemed $300 million of preferred stock in July, contributing to the continued deleveraging of our balance sheet. Redemption was funded by our June common stock offering.","Our debt and preferred equity to EBITDA coverage as of the third quarter is 8x. We anticipate that our year-end coverage will be approximately 7.7x. As a reminder, our target is 7x, which we expect to meet in the next 15 months or so through EBITDA growth and amortization of property debt from retained earnings.","In addition to our target around leverage, we have a goal to create an unencumbered pool of assets to provide additional financial flexibility and safety to our balance sheet. We started this pool in the third quarter, using proceeds from our line of credit temporarily to pay off our maturing loan. We will repay our line draw with proceeds from other refinancing activity in the coming months.","Lastly, with the closing of our Lincoln Place property loan, one of our larger 2013 property debt maturities was refinanced using [ph] $172 million of property debt coming due in 2013, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding debt. $27 million of this amount consists of 3 first quarter maturities. We expect to pay off 2 of these loans, increasing our unencumbered pool to approximately $160 million of gross asset value.","Finally, as to guidance, we expect full year pro forma FFO of $1.79 to $1.85 per share and AFFO of $1.31 to $1.37 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store NOI growth of 6.5%, which  is unchanged from the midpoint of the range we provided last quarter. We expect full year revenue to increase 4.6% when compared to 2011, which is 40 basis points lower than the midpoint we expected last quarter.","The table on Page 6 of our earnings release shows how this revenue decrease has been offset by expense savings. Revenue is expected to decrease 40 basis points, due to both a decrease in previously projected tenant utility reimbursements, which are accounted for in other rental income and our expectation that occupancy will be lower in the second half of 2012 than previously expected. Expenses are expected to be lower 100 basis points due mainly to lower utility costs. These 2 variances offset, maintaining our guidance for NOI growth.","Specific to expense performance year-to-date, as disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 6D, we have been successful in reducing our personnel cost by $5 million. As we've discussed previously, we fully implemented a new property management system in 2011, which automates certain tasks that were previously competed manually. Our savings in personnel is offset somewhat by the related increase in software and technology costs of $1.3 million, also noted on Schedule 6D.","Our current FFO guidance assumes Affordable Same Store NOI growth of 4%, a 100 basis point improvement at the midpoint. So taken together, total same-store NOI growth is expected to be 6% which is unchanged at the midpoint.","For the fourth, quarter pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.47 to $0.53 per share with year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI growth projected to be 5% to 6%. Please note that our guidance does not include an estimate for the impact of Hurricane Sandy.","Finally, we won't provide specific guidance for 2013 today, but we did want to provide some thoughts on revenue growth for next year. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, to the third quarter of 2012, our new and renewal leases are up 4.6% over expiring leases. For the full year 2012, we expect that the new and renewal leases will be up approximately 4% over expiring leases. This decrease from the year-to-date result is due to the typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter.","There are 4 drivers to revenue growth for 2013, one is 2012 leasing activity, which I just described. The second is leasing activity anticipated for 2013. Third parties and our own internal analyses at this time anticipate similar results in 2013 leasing activity to our 2012 results. The third and fourth drivers are occupancy changes and expectations around other income. We'll provide a specific range next quarter, but taking into account these 4 drivers, our view currently is that 2013 won't be too different to 2012 with regards to revenue growth for Aimco.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you. The first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rob Stevenson at Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Is -- where are you guys in terms of the NAPICO sale?","Ernest M. Freedman","Rob, this is Ernie. We continue to make good progress with the group who we'll be selling that to. And we -- just as we talked about at beginning the of the year, we anticipate that, that closing will occur prior to year end of 2012. We expect that to be a fourth quarter event, and we will announce it as soon as that's complete.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then you guys have had one of the lowest same-store expense growth rates of any of the apartment companies, and you talked about Schedule 6D in your comments. Can you talk a little bit about what's recurring going forward? And where you see the most upward pressure over the next few quarters? I mean, is the payroll and utility saving sustainable? And is the software and insurance likely to be more recurring?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. I'll take a crack at that, Rob. With regard to -- one, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of providing guidance around expenses for 2013. But as we look at our expenses, our largest stress will be around real estate taxes. Real estate taxes each quarter this year have increased over the prior quarter, and we still do expect for 2012 real estate taxes to come in around 6% increase year-over-year. And year-to-date, I believe we're about 4.4%. So we think as we look at 2013, by far, that will be our biggest stress item. Items around software should stabilize out, because we rolled out the system last year. And so I would not expect a significant increase nor a significant decrease. It should be about flat in terms of software and technology costs. And importantly on the personnel side, we continue to find ways to be innovative and find different ways to potentially look to keep those costs under control. So real estate tax is our biggest concern. Other cost items, we feel pretty good about. I would say on utilities is this year was a mild winter, and we had a milder summer in terms of electric usage in the summer. The utilities could be a little bit of a stress point for us next year, but we'll just need to see as we get closer to next quarter, and we provide guidance there as what could happen with utilities and overall how that impacts expenses.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And payroll on the on-site payroll side, is this savings due to technology and software rollout? Or are you guys doing something different in terms of how you staff and manage and rotate people around near communities in order to save costs there?","Ernest M. Freedman","It's a combination of things. I'll let Keith give you a little bit of detail and just a few examples of where we've been able to have significant changes where things are being done more by the customer and there are more automated processes versus manual processes. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Rob, a couple of the opportunities is that with -- electronic payments online has been a big change in how we've done business with the new system. To give you a reference point, 71% of our payments now are done by our customers online. They don't have to be taken to the bank via manual check, as they were in the past. Online renewals is another great opportunity that the technology platform has really enabled us to have efficiencies. 60% of our renewals now are actually executed online, where previously they were a manual printout of a physical lease and hand signed. And now it's electronically signed and done through the technology platform. So just a couple of areas of opportunity where we've been able to gain some efficiencies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the initial thoughts on the impact of Hurricane Sandy on your portfolio. Can -- is Aimco still self-insured on those types of costs? And -- or is the third-party insurer that would get you down to sort of the net $1 million to $1.5 million?","Ernest M. Freedman","Let me try turn it over, Karin, to Lisa, who's responsible for our insurance and our risk group.","Lisa R. Cohn","Karin, thanks for that question. A portion of our losses are self-insured but not related to Hurricane Sandy. So after deductibles, that will be covered by our third-party carriers.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And second question just relates to the reduction in your expectations for occupancy for the second half of the year that drove your same-store revenue guidance down a little bit. Just talk about what happened there that changed your view on that? Do think you pushed rents too hard? Or was there something that was different than what you expected that drove that occupancy decline?","Keith M. Kimmel","Karin, this is Keith. I'll answer that for you. The variance in our -- in the occupancy is largely attributed to a couple of operational opportunities in Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Particularly, these 2 markets really have not increased on occupancy as quickly as we had anticipated last quarter. And frankly, they're a bit behind from where they were last year. And so both markets, while they were growing, they just didn't grow at a pace that we had anticipated.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it's really limited to just those 2 markets? It wasn't a portfolio-wide sequence of events?","Keith M. Kimmel","No, that's correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Meliker at MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. I was hoping maybe you can help us understand a little bit about your Affordable Same Store NOI growth. Clearly, you put up good numbers, and you're expecting that to continue through the fourth quarter. How have you been able to drive NOI so much stronger than expectations heading into the year in the Affordable portfolio?","Ernest M. Freedman","A couple of things I'll highlight there, this is Ernie, on the Affordable side. One is we've had the best success that we had in the history of the company in pushing occupancy there. It's always been a high-occupancy portfolio for us, running in the high 97% to low 98%. This year we've actually bumped up almost to 99% in occupancy, and we just had a laser focus on that this year by our operations teams with Leeann Morein and Keith Kimmel are really pushing to get that up as high as possible. And secondly, similar too on our Conventional side, we've had similar successes on the expense side that we didn't anticipate at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, across our Conventional portfolio and Affordable, we thought expenses would be going up closer to 2.5%, and our expense experience in the Affordable is similar to our Conventional, where now we think it's going to be a 1% to 1.25% type of increase to expenses. And so it's just having the opportunity to get a little bit more out of occupancy has really led to a stronger year in Affordable than we had projected at the beginning of the year, Ryan.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, also, with regards to that, I guess, is the occupancy up so much not only because of the efforts your team's doing but also because you've got more people that fall into the affordable camp than we might have over the past few years, and that creates, I guess, a larger demand pool?","Ernest M. Freedman","Not really so much for our portfolio. Most of our portfolio, Ryan, is tailored to seniors. And so even though that populating -- the baby-boom population is growing. We haven't seen a major shift in demand from that. It's really just being real active with our waiting list, making sure when a unit comes open that we have a fresh waiting list. So we have multiple people who can move in, not potentially 1 or 2 who may have moved to different things. It's just being a little more focused on it and going after that opportunity. So it's not so much a demographic or demand item that has helped us drive that.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Okay. That sounds good. And then just one last follow up. And this is -- I guess, at 99% occupancy and inability to really push rents that much, it's unlikely for us to see this type of revenue growth next year. Is that a safe assumption?","Ernest M. Freedman","We'd like, Keith, to get 101%, but unfortunately we can't rent out the closets and other places in there, so no.  What I would say is that we always have opportunity to push rents there from the perspective of what we can get from the various agencies. We get our inflationary increases. So we'll be more challenged. We won't have as much of an uptick from occupancy as well as that -- next year as we've had this year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just a question on the comment that Ernie made. You're selling assets below the implied cap rate of the stock, which Ernie said was 6.6%. So what does that tell you? I think that, that's -- the discount has certainly been a focus of yours for some time. But given the recent efforts that you've made on the portfolio and the balance sheet and the continued discount, could you just update us on your plans from here to close that gap?","Terry Considine","Dave, it's Terry. I think our plans are steady as she goes. We've had a successful 2012, and we plan to continue it through the balance of the year and into next year. And so I think next year, you'll see continued same-store net operating income growth. You'll see a continued upgrade in the quality of the portfolio. You'll see a continued delevering of the balance sheet. You'll see a continued simplification of the business. And you'll see continued lower G&A cost. And so I think as we keep working, there has been a transformation in the company. And I think over some time, that will be understood better and appreciated by the market.","Ernest M. Freedman","Dave, I would just add to that, that it also means you'll see more of Terry and Miles and me and other of the senior team. Throughout the year we've been out meeting with folks and talking about this portfolio transformation that has occurred. And we are seeing momentum from the fact that many folks are discussing it, writing about it and\/or discussing. We meet with investors talking about, but we just have to continue to point out to folks where the portfolio is today, and it's a much different portfolio than it was many years ago. And so it's on us to continue that communication, and we'll do that, and we'll do it in a couple of weeks in NAREIT and we'll do it at  [indiscernible] soon after that and continue to be up with folks to pound the drum about where -- how we think the stock is valued compared to the quality of the portfolio that we currently own. And it's only getting better.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Can you provide some early -- just a commentary on how you're thinking about asset sales for 2013?","Ernest M. Freedman","A little bit early for us to talk about that. And we gave disposition guidance that we've maintained in terms of what we think will happen with 2012. What we'll do is we'll match up our needs as we talk about, and make sure we have the sales to cover that. When we talk about our needs, we talk about what we think is our best opportunity, we continue to improve the portfolio and grow its value, which is through redevelopment. And so it's to continue to fund that great redevelopment pipeline that we have, and we'll look at our other needs as well. But it would be a little bit early for us, Dave, to provide a range for what we'll be looking to dispose of in 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to the last question, I know you wouldn't talk about 2013. But can you give us a sense on the fourth quarter? It seems like there's a lot expected in the fourth quarter? Is there any portfolio sales there? And also, just in terms of pricing, are you seeing any changes in the last 90 days in pricing for assets?","Ernest M. Freedman","Michael, let me start, and I'll turn over to John for that. As you can see from what we've done year-to-date, we've had a significant ramp up in the third quarter compared to the first 2 quarters, and what we need to achieve in the fourth quarter isn't too dissimilar from what we sold in the third quarter to get to our disposition guidance for the year. With that, let me turn it over to John to give some more specific details [indiscernible].","John E. Bezzant","Volume and how our transactions piece together, the vast majority of them are single-entity transactions. There will be certain circumstances particularly in the Affordable side, where we deal -- same buyer will buy 2 or 3 properties, generally, in a tight geographic area and of the same product type. But we're doing one-off sales, no portfolio transactions. And our pricing is consistent to what we've seen over the rest of the year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. The second question is more of a strategy question. You talked about growing the unencumbered base there. Aimco's traditionally been a secured borrower amortizing mortgages. Is that still going to be the case? Or is there a thought process over the next several years to diversify the capital structure a bit more?","Ernest M. Freedman","Mike, good question. We've had that question with regards to the unencumbered pool, and we're not looking to change our strategy. We still want to remain financing our properties at the property level. We do want create the unencumbered pool to provide us a little more financial flexibility and safety. But it's not from a desire to want to change our strategy in terms of how we're employing property debt or any other type of debt at the company.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you very much for your interest in Aimco. We're pleased by our third quarter results. We look forward to a solid fourth quarter and another good year in 2013. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"2146":["Apartment Investment and Management Company (NYSE:AIV) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call February  2, 2018  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Lisa Cohn - EVP, General Counsel and Secretary","Terry Considine - Chairman and CEO","Keith Kimmel - EVP, Property Operations","John Bezzant - Chief Investment Officer","Paul Beldin - CFO","Analysts","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Rob Stevenson - Janney","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Buck Horne - Raymond James","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Aimco Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day.","During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment, including projections related to 2018 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I\u2019ll now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on the call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco.","For Aimco, last year was a good year. At the bottom line, AFFO per share was up 8% but it\u2019s more important than the one year result that our success in our five areas of focus provides a foundation for the long-term sustainable profitability we seek for the shareholder capital and entrusted to us.","Here are few highlights. In property operations, same-store NOI growth was 4.2% over 4% growth rate for the seventh consecutive year. Keith and his team successfully completed the lease-ups of One Canal in Boston and the Indigo in Redwood City, both well ahead of schedule. In redevelopment in Center City, Philadelphia, we completed the construction and lease-up of The Sterling and of our third tower at Park Towne Place. And we began construction on the fourth and final tower at Park Towne.","In portfolio management, we again improved portfolio quality with average revenue per apartment home now more than $2,100 a month, up 7% year-over-year.","As to our balance sheet, we have a low leverage investment grade balance sheet, safer because our leverage is primarily nonrecourse and long-dated. We have abundant liquidity with more than $500 million available on our revolving credit facility and we have great flexibility with unencumbered properties worth more than $1.8 billion, up about 13% year-over-year.","And as to our team, our intentional culture emphasizes customer focus, personal responsibility for results, collaboration and respect for others. It\u2019s the foundation for the stable and cohesive team that achieved the accomplishments we\u2019ve just reported.","As we begin the new year, I am upbeat and energized by our opportunities. U.S. economy is strong and accelerating. Tax reform will provide an additional lift and will increase individual disposable income for many. Favorable demographics and rising incomes provide solid demand for our high-quality apartments. These positive support our redevelopment and development activities and also simulate new supply.","As I read industry commentary, I note that some are concerned about competitive new supply and sluggish rents. But, these are conditions for which Aimco has planned and prepared. First, new supply is usually at the A price point, affecting only indirectly Aimco\u2019s 50% allocation to B and C apartments. Second, building cycles are local asynchronous for this, rotating among markets so that when one market is overbuilt, another is not. Aimco\u2019s broad geographic diversification helps. Third, supply exposure is further mitigated by local job growth and by situations where Aimco\u2019s A rents are substantially lower than the rents charged by new supply. So, between our allocation to Bs, the geographic diversification of our investment in As and other mitigating factors, most of our capital, say 80% is invested where new building is not the major problem that bedevils so many downtowns. And fourth, even where top line growth is sluggish, Aimco often outperformance at the bottom line because our long-term success with innovation and productivity has held onsite costs operating expenses, essentially flat for about the past 10 years.","So, continuing growth in property incomes together with profitable redevelopment activities will drive growth in gross asset value and net asset value. Net asset value per share increases, plus cash dividend are what we call economic income and uses our primary metric for financial success. Over the past five years, our NAV per share has increased at a compounded annual growth rate between 10% and 11% and our cash dividends have nearly doubled.","Now, some investors ask me about our emphasis on NAV thinking it applicable only to a hypothetical liquidation. But, I like it because it\u2019s the most objective and reliable predictor of long-term cash flows. NAV represents the distilled investment decisions of tens of thousands of market participants, specifically their judgment as to the present value of expected future results adjusted for risk. This market-based result is objective unbiased by awkward accounting or management optimism.","Our Aimco calculations have been confirmed by property sales of many billions of dollars. So, when applied to Aimco, NAV captures the importance to the overall enterprise of the $4.7 billion, 37% of our capital that\u2019s invested outside of same-store in acquisitions, in development and in redevelopment where current returns are not yet stabilized but substantial future cash flows are expected. And NAV also reflects the relative importance of the current asset management income which we expect to decline as we exit that business. And it points to the opportunity to redeploy the capital invested there to our core businesses with their higher sustained returns, which will again make their contribution to NAV growth.","So for these great prospects and for the good results achieved last year, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver as well as across the country.","And now, for a more detailed report on the fourth quarter, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry.","I am pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter in operations, led by strong performances in Los Angeles, San Diego and Boston. Same-store revenues were up 2.8%, expenses were up 2.1%, and net operating income was up 3.1% for the quarter and 4.2% for the full-year. Our residents continue to reward us with high marks as they gave us better than a 4-star rating in customer satisfaction for the 17th consecutive quarter with a record 4.29 out of a possible 5 starts. This strong customer satisfaction limited our turnover to 48.5% for the quarter. For the full-year in 2017, turnover was 47%, a 160 basis-point reduction from 2016. This lower turnover was a key contributor to our operational efficiencies and our full-year expense results. We saw increased average daily occupancy and finished at 96.3% for the quarter. That result was 20 basis points better than that fourth quarter of 2016 and our best fourth quarter of occupancy since 2010. Move-out reasons for the quarter are similar when compared to the recent quarters in our long-term averages.","Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter. Blended lease rates were up 1.6% with renewal rents having solid increases of 4.5%. We saw a particular strength in Denver, Seattle, Nashville and Chicago. Renewal rents in these markets increased more than 5% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new leases were 80 basis points lower than the prior lease as we traded for higher occupancy during the winter months. We saw continued improvements in Los Angeles and Miami where new leases grew 2% to 3%.","Turning to the fourth quarter same-store revenue growth. Our top performers had revenue increases over 4% for the quarter. This was lead by Los Angeles where we have our largest concentration of capital, followed by San Diego and Boston. Our steady performers which had revenue growth from 2.5% to 3%, were Atlanta, Chicago and the Bay Area with revenue growth of 1% to 1.5% we had Washington DC, Denver, Miami, Seattle, and New York. And finally with revenue growth of negative 1%, we had Philadelphia. As a reminder, our same-store sales Philadelphia portfolio represents only three communities and does not include our prime redevelopment assets in Center City.","Looking ahead to 2018, we\u2019ve seen an operational outlook that is quite similar to 2017. We anticipate revenue growth of 2.6% at the midpoint for the year, comprised of average daily occupancy, 10 basis points higher than 2017 and a rate growth of 2.5%, which is based on blessed lease rates on par with last year.","Our controllable operating expenses which exclude utilities, taxes and insurance, are expected to rise 2% at the midpoint. This increase includes strategic investments in technology to enable greater efficiencies for our teams and an improved customer experience, higher cost due to the reprising of multiyear service contracts, and lastly, increased compensation for our top-performing team members who enable our operational success. This, combined with changes in taxes and insurance, which Paul will discuss later, result in NOI growth for the year of 2.4% at the midpoint.","Turning our intention to the 2018 outlook for individual markets. We see our top markets with revenue growth of 4% to 6% are Seattle and San Diego. Strong markets with revenue growth over 3% are Denver, Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Our steady markets with revenue growth over 2% are the Bay Area, Washington DC, Atlanta and New York. And finally, in Philadelphia and Miami, we expect to grow about 1.2% to 2%.","As we look at our preliminary January results, we see a solid beginning to the New Year with a strengthening of our rates and occupancy. Blended lease rates are up 2.7% with renewals up 5.2% and new leases about flat. Our average daily occupancy for January is 96.3%, some 30 basis points higher than 2017. And finally, February and March renewal offers went out with 4 to 6% increases.","And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco\u2019s success, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. On the transactions front, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold two affordable properties and three of our lower rated conventional properties, producing $381 million in net proceeds. And by mid-January, we completed the few remaining property sales that funded the equity for the 2017 reacquisition of our partner\u2019s interest in the Palazzo communities. In total, these property sales closed at prices that exceeded their underlying values and our published NAV at NOI cap rates around 6 and free cash flow cap rates around 5.","The Palazzo pair trade reallocated capital from weaker submarkets in Southern Virginia, Southern New Jersey and suburban Maryland to the Mid-Wilshire submarket of Los Angeles where we expect to achieve superior long-term revenue growth, higher rents and higher operating margins, and added $50 million of net asset value to our portfolio in the process.","Similarly, our redevelopment activities in 2017 continue to create value. As Terry noted, we completed construction in Center City, Philadelphia on our major redevelopments at The Sterling and the third tower of Park Towne Place, and we continued several projects elsewhere. In total, during 2017, we invested a $158 million in our redevelopments. This investment created roughly $0.35 of value for each dollar invested, leading to NAV creation of more than $55 million. This creation of value to redevelopment along with operational earnings growth are the primary drivers of our economic income performance in recent years. As Terry explained, we measure economic income as the change in our net asset value plus dividends paid. For the past five years, Aimco\u2019s economic income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 14%.","Looking to 2018, we expect to complete the redevelopment of the final tower of Park Towne Place, continue construction on Parc Mosaic in Boulder, Colorado with anticipated first deliveries in mid-2019, and carry on the planning and execution of redevelopment and development activities at other communities. We expect these activities to create another $50 million to $60 million in net asset value to the Aimco portfolio. While our 2018 guidance does not include any acquisitions, we continue to look for opportunities to make accretive pair trades that improve our portfolio.","With that I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, John.","Today, I\u2019d like to spend a few moments on our 2017 results and our balance sheet and then turn to the 2018 guidance that was published yesterday with our earnings release.","At the beginning of 2017, we guided to three primary financial metrics. First, at the midpoint, we guided to an 8% increase in AFFO, and achieved it. Second, also at the midpoint, we guided to a 5% increase in FFO, and delivered a 6% increase. And third, we guided to a 3.5 to 5% increase in same-store net operating income and achieved growth of 4.2%. And in doing so, we continued to demonstrate our ability to reduce cost through innovation, delivering a 1.3% reduction in controllable operating expenses and overall expense growth of 70 basis points.","Next, turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains safe and strong with minimal 2018 maturities and over $500 million of capacity available on our revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we closed or rate-locked $189 million of nonrecourse fixed-rate property debt. These loans have a weighted average term of approximately eight years and an interest rate of 3.48%, a spread of 117 basis points over the corresponding treasury rates at the time of pricing. For the year, property debt refinancing activities lowered our weighted average fixed interest rates by almost 20 basis points to 4.64%, generating more than $6 million of prospective annual interest savings. In short, 2017 was a good year for Aimco, both in operations and in our investment activities where we realized gains on sold properties of almost $300 million.","We also recognized an impairment, resulting from a January 2018 decision to sell a property as part of a legal settlement. In this settlement, we agreed to sell our interest in our La Jolla Cove property to resolve legal actions filed in 2014 by a group of disappointed buyers with hope to acquire the property. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a gross impairment of approximately $36 million. $26 million of this amount relates to a day one increase in recorded land value unrelated to our cash purchase that GAAP required to offset a deferred tax liability assumed in our purchase. Upon closing of our sales that tax liability will be assumed by the buyer, resulting in no economic loss to Aimco. This $26 million is entirely a GAAP-based paper loss. The true economic loss of $10 million is offset by cash distributions received during our ownership and avoided legal costs for continued litigation.","Now, turning to 2018. We expect our core business of owning and operating predominantly market rate apartment communities will continue to perform well. At the midpoint, we expect that net operating income growth of our same-store and other real estate portfolio will contribute $0.09 of year-over-year incremental AFFO, and that our redevelopment and development communities will contribute an incremental $0.05 of growth. Dilution from asset sales, which funded our redevelopment and development activities is expected to be approximately $0.04.","Outside of property operations, as we continue to simplify our business and reduce the scale of offsite activities, we anticipate a $0.01 reduction of these costs in 2018. This $0.11 of AFFO growth is partially offset by a $0.04 reduction in tax benefits, primarily from the effect of the recent tax law change and $0.03 from our long-discussed reduction in the contribution of our asset management business. As we continue our exit from this business, we are excited to redeploy its capital to our core business of real estate ownership with its attractive returns. At the bottom line, the result is 2018 pro forma FFO per share in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 and AFFO per share in the range of $2.11 to $2.21.","Now, diving a little bit deeper into our same-store expectations. We have established full-year 2018 guidance for same-store revenue growth of between 2.1% and 3.1%. The earn-in of our 2017 leasing activity will contribute 1.2% with the remaining growth primarily resulting from our blended lease rates and changes in occupancy. Same-store expenses are expected to grow between 2.6% and 3.6%, a level of that is uncharacteristically high for Aimco and is primarily attributable to higher real estate taxes and insurance costs. In 2017, we experienced favorable tax appeals in San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles which lowered 2017 taxes by approximately $1 million and is contributing roughly 70 basis points to the 2018 growth rate. And after five years of the declining costs, Aimco\u2019s property hazard premium is expected to increase by approximately 10% in 2018 due to worldwide casually events contributing approximately 40 basis points to our expense growth rate.","One last item, as you are aware, Aimco is engaged in litigation with Airbnb to protect our property rights to select our residence and their neighbors. Due to the unpredictable nature of these cases and associated legal costs, Aimco will exclude such costs from 2018 pro forma FFO and AFFO.","To summarize, Aimco expects 2018 to be another good year with continued strong revenue and NOI growth, strengthen flexibility in our balance sheet, and stability from its high-quality and well-located portfolio. Given these positive prospects, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in our totally dividend of $0.38 per share.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I\u2019ll turn over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. John, given your comments on continuing to look for acquisitions today in a pair trade manner combined with the comments talked about earlier on the call and referenced NAV and how you think about it, given the discount where are you trading versus NAV today. Would you consider stock buybacks and just what are the latest thoughts there?","John Bezzant","Austin, I appreciate you directing the question to me. I think I will defer over to Terry on the question of stock buybacks.","Terry Considine","Austin, thank you very much for very good question. It\u2019s something we think about regularly. It\u2019s part of our tool kit. And as we work through the year ahead, we\u2019re open to all options.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then, maybe touching on dispositions, you guys had assumed 600 million in your 2017 guidance, I think you\u2019ve closed about 450 million included what closed subsequent to year-end. So, curious what\u2019s driving the delta there and then how should we think about the timing on the balance of dispositions, assumed in your 2018 guidance?","John Bezzant","Yes. Austin, and just heads up to everybody else on the call, we have a bit of a rough connection and so we\u2019re getting bits and pieces of your questions. But, I believe it was regarding our disposition guidance for the year and what we actually did. As you noted, during 2017, the bulk of our dispositions activity took place at the end of the year. We have closed a few deals here in January of this year that are really carryover deals from 2017, and the bulk of our 2018 guidance we anticipate will take place toward the end of the year as well.","Operator","And our next question comes of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","On the asset management business and the tax benefit roll-off, how should we think about that beyond \u201818, when are you going to exit the business? And you referenced capital coming back to and being able to be redeployed, how much capital are we talking about?","Paul Beldin","I will talk about the financial impact for the next couple of years and then Terry or John, if you want to add any color, please jump in. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned that we expect 2017 over 2018 a $0.03 decline from our asset management business. As we look forward into 2019, without getting into particulars about the business as a whole in 2019, we know that there will be a small decline in the amount of low income housing tax for the amortization. As a reminder, those are fees paid to us by our investors to originate those low income housing tax credits. And so, those are expected to decline by approximately $2 million next year or a penny. We don\u2019t expect to have any other declines from sales in 2019 from the communities, although we do work with our partners to explore opportunities to sell. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we think that will be a good thing, because it will allow us to reinvest that capital into our conventional operations.","Terry Considine","Juan, what I would add to that is that there is a pretty financial description if you will, financial impacts of the asset management business in our net asset value disclosures. And so, I think you might look there. They are valued at the discounted cash flow of the relatively certain payments that we expect to receive fees and other elements of the original syndications, but that disregards the upside potential of redevelopment. And so, whether we will see that through the run-off according to an existing schedule or be accelerated by a transaction is as unknown at this time and we will keep you posted.","Juan Sanabria","Great, thanks. And then, I was just wondering if you guys have targeted any new redevelopment starts or if you could talk about maybe what\u2019s next on the horizon, whether that be Parc Bay Plaza, anything in the New York City area on the Upper East Side and kind what the latest for Calhoun?","John Bezzant","Thanks, Juan. We do have some identified projects that are in -- continue through plan including those that you just referenced. Yes, club in Miami, project up on the Upper East Side in New York that are, what I would call further out. And those would be really more of a development type of a project where we would be building some new buildings. On the redevelopment side of the pipeline, we have an existing pipeline that\u2019s identified in Schedule 10 of our release. We have a handful of others that are in the planning process that when we are ready to implement them, we will announce them.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Terry, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted the diversified nature of your portfolio on a geographic basis. And I\u2019m just wondering, going forward, if tax reform or if the impact from SALT has changed the way that you look to allocate capital going forward?","Terry Considine","John, that\u2019s a very good question. I thank you for it. I have an incomplete answer. I think that tax reform has been a tremendous stimulus to the U.S. economy. And it will affect different regions differently. And we would like to maintain a highly diversified portfolio. And so, it gives us a change that we need to think through for different markets. And we don\u2019t have anything to report on it today, but it\u2019s the right question. And we hope to have a more complete answer perhaps by the end of next quarter.","John Kim","Okay. So, little bit too early to tell at this point?","Terry Considine","Yes. We\u2019re thinking about it, but we\u2019re not prepared to act on it, and it\u2019s easier to report when we\u2019ve taken action.","John Kim","Got it, okay. Looking at your 2018 outlook versus your initial outlook from last year, one thing that kind of stood out to us was the property upgrades. So, you exceeded your target for 2017; and then for 2018, it looks like that range is higher than your initial outlook for 2018. Can you just discuss why this is happening. And if this is really the upgrade from kind of like your Cs and B minuses to a higher grade product.","John Bezzant","John, I think you\u2019re referring to the model that we published a year ago for 2018, which provided some broad parameters and applied those parameters in a mathematical way to forecast a range of potential outcomes. And so, there were some variability between what was modeled, and then as went through the detailed budget and planning process where we identified specific opportunities of specific projects to improve our communities. And so, you\u2019re right, it is slightly higher from the model to what we\u2019ve published in our guidance. And the reason is that Lisa and Keith and their teams have done a wonderful job of identifying communities that we expect to earn about a 10% return and a 9% plus IRR by investing dollars on those projects. So, we\u2019re excited about these opportunities. And I think it will benefit the portfolio both next year and along into the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Terry, you sort of opened the door in your opening comments talking about NAV and why you think it\u2019s relevant and why you focus on it. And you talked about the unstabilized, the acquisitions, basically the 20% a year gross NAV that\u2019s not in there that arguably will start earning income and then has cash flows. But, I guess if you take the other side of it, one of the important things for NAV is it does give you a sense of overall value relative to where a stock is trading. And you sort of dismissed the share buyback question pretty quickly, sinks an arrow in quiver, in your toolkit. The reality is Street NAVs are $50, you think stock is worth 53. Stock\u2019s trading at $41 million. You trade at the widest discount to NAV in the apartment space at almost 20%; your peers are at 10%. So, it\u2019s not only just an absolute discount, it\u2019s a massive relative discount to your peers. Why aren\u2019t you more confident in your answer about saying, yes, we see this discount and we\u2019re going to do something to take advantage of it, and we\u2019re going to either put the Company up for sale, look for M&A opportunities or be aggressive at buying back our stock? It\u2019s preposterous that you are not like being aggressive enough at trying to narrow discount that you think is there.","Terry Considine","Well, Michael, I think you are focusing on a very important question. So, I appreciate it, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s very much on my mind and the mind of our team here. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s also on the minds of our shareholders. And it\u2019s something that we will address in a productive way. But, I wanted to bring your attention what our shareholders keep telling us, which is they are focused on a long-term asset allocation, they are focused on longer-term results, they are not as interested by where the stock trades day to day, and that they look at the long-term record which is satisfying to them, and relatively quite good. And, I think that this will work out in the course of time.","Michael Bilerman","But, why won\u2019t you take more aggressive action as Chairman and CEO of the Company? I mean, you can -- strategic alternatives and selling the Company is one thing, but you are at a leverage position, now where you are underleveraged, you have confidence in the private market. Why not buy back stock at a 20% discount to what your investors and analysts think your NAV is and a 25% discount to what you think it is, why not do it?","Terry Considine","Those are good questions. I\u2019m going to say that we would like to talk about results and actions, and we just haven\u2019t made a decision on that.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Ivy Zelman","Terry, maybe you can chat a little bit about your portfolio, as you said about 50% is really more in A and class B and C. Remind us how much are Cs versus Bs I guess first. And then, what you think the supply that\u2019s still elevated for 2018 is impacting your forecasting and your outlook for \u201818, where there is any trickle fact and maybe some pressure on rents as As are coming down or maybe you are not incorporating any impacts from the supply?","Terry Considine","Well, Ivy, thank you very much. It\u2019s good to hear your voice in this call. I think that the Bs and Cs are broken roughly 35% Bs and 15% Cs, plus, I would call them because they have high average rents compared to the nation but lower in their market. So, they tend to be in high-rent markets and tend to have high land values. I think that the impact -- our experience is that the impact of new supply is primarily at the A price point, and that in inside Aimco, if you did a gross screen, you\u2019d see that perhaps 40% of our -- 40% of our capital would screen to be inside those kinds of markets. But, if you adjust for the ones where we have an A for the overall market but a B price in the submarket, and if you adjust for the ones where job growth is quite high, then, we end up with about 20% of our capital in the submarkets where we expect that Keith will earn his keep this year by competing with lease-ups that often discount their rent to absorb that incremental supply.","A related part to that -- to your question, as I heard it, was that trickledown effect from the A markets to the Bs and Cs, and there is. There is no doubt about that. And I think that you and your team have written persuasively about the general slowdown in rent growth. And so, we fight that every day; there are offsets to that in improving retention, increasing ADO and controlling cost. And I think that at the end of this year, you and others will be satisfied with the job that Keith and his team do in that area.","Ivy Zelman","Just to make sure I understand it then, you are incorporating some modest impact, deceleration in markets where you\u2019ll see some trickle effect, I think you said 20%, is that correct?","Terry Considine","20% of our capital is in markets that we think that are pretty directly impacted. And yes we go through on a property-by-property basis and so we will have less optimism on -- in those areas and greater optimism elsewhere.","Ivy Zelman","And then, another one, if I could, on the competitive landscape and the transaction market for you guys. recognizing that you are obviously competing on the value add product and cap rates have really compressed. Can you give us a perspective of are you still interested in doing value add or are you pulling some because the valuations or more steep at this point, and just then maybe comment on a lending [ph] market and what you are seeing their please?","Terry Considine","You are exactly right that it\u2019s a competitive market, and we see lots of properties that we think are priced beyond our ambition. But, we are interested to see properties where we think that the redevelopment skills and the operating skills that have been developed can make it an accretive transaction for us. And so, that\u2019s why we keep looking.","Ivy Zelman","And then, just again on the competitive landscape on what lenders are willing to, are you seeing any change for the positive, lenders easing a little bit after being stringent, any change there?","Terry Considine","I think for the interest rate markets, lenders remain quite aggressive, there is a plenty of liquidity, and that the life insurance companies where who are our primary lenders, if anything, are little bit more aggressive than they were a year ago.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Number of your peers are seeing 5% plus increases in payroll due to upward cost structure on both wages and benefits. You guys are actually down a $1 million year-over-year on the offsite cost in your guidance, and it didn\u2019t seem like it was a major factor in the same-store expense guidance either. What are you guys doing to keep the personnel cost down? Is it more technology, mix of more part time people hordes and hordes of unpaid interns, what are you guys doing?","Keith Kimmel","It\u2019s not hordes and hordes of unpaid interns. Listen, it\u2019s a combination of things. And so, let me just walk you through it. Really, it\u2019s about innovation and productivity. And where we have found that we can take fraction or that had been done onsite, move it to our shared service center in which we get a much greater efficiency. When we actually look at the average compensation for our team members, it\u2019s actually gone up greater than 5%, especially for those that are our top performers. So, at the end of the day, we are paying our team members more, rewarding those that are great, and we are finding ways to be much more efficient within our operation onsite.","Rob Stevenson","And then, Paul, what\u2019s the litigation cost to date regarding Airbnb?","Paul Beldin","Our litigation costs to-date have just not been all that significant, wasn\u2019t impactful to our 2017 results.","Rob Stevenson","And by your comments earlier in terms of excluding it from guidance, are you expecting that to pick up over the course of \u201818?","Lisa Cohn","This is Lisa. We do. As you probably saw, we had a challenge in our California case, but we\u2019re succeeding in our Florida case. And as with most legal proceedings, there are ups and downs, and these cases are going to turn on some complicated legal issues. We\u2019re going to be appealing the dismissal in California to the ninth circuit and in Florida we survived the motion to dismiss. And the fundamental issue for us is that we just object to their intentional interference in our private property rights and our contracts and the impact that that has on our residents. We\u2019ve consistently said that our most important job is picking our residents and our residents\u2019 neighbors. And what Airbnb is doing is preventing us from fulfilling that promise to our customers. So, as we proceed with the litigation, there will be some increased costs coming into 2018.","Operator","And our next question comes from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Conor Wagner","Keith, you mentioned on rent growth that it would be similar new lease and renewals. So, is the assumption around 4.5 for 2018 on renewals and around 50 to 75 bps on new lease fair?","Paul Beldin","Conor, this is Paul. That math that you just did, works. But as you know, there are a million different ways to achieve revenue growth, so it could be a function of higher rent, lower renew, higher new, lower renewal or combination of both those and changes in occupancy. So, there is a lot of different levers to pull but the high level math that you just walked through, certainly works.","Conor Wagner","Thanks, Paul. And then, Terry, you opened up the call, you said you\u2019re upbeat and you\u2019re energized. We note that you\u2019re going to celebrate your 25-year anniversary in the public market next year. Just like to know what you\u2019re thoughts are for yourself and your role in the Company over the next three to five years.","Terry Considine","Well, Conor, just to put gasoline on the fire, it will actually be my second 25th anniversary of being in the public market, since that began in 1971.","Conor Wagner","You said it, not me.","Terry Considine","At Aimco, all facts are friendly. I\u2019m enthusiastic and energetic about my work. I\u2019m delighted by the team with whom I spend my days. We do good work and we expect to do that for the foreseeable future.","Conor Wagner","And for you specifically, as of right now just for the investors that are listening in, you feel -- again, the future is uncertain but making three to five-year commitment in your role as CEO and Chairman is something you\u2019re comfortable with?","Terry Considine","I am.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you. And then, Terry, just on a lighter note, I know, you\u2019re the only apartment CEO who has Boston and Philadelphia in the Super Bowl and given that Philadelphia is going to riot in either case of the outcome, have you increased your CapEx, your maintenance reserves in that market for Q1?","Terry Considine","Well, you point to a material risk, because Philadelphia will riot in either case but Boston may celebrate too and burn the town down. So, either way, it\u2019s going to be an expensive Sunday.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Well, that question was taken from me, but I have one more. So, Terry, at the beginning, you mentioned disposable income as a consequence of tax reform. And I\u2019m curious how this kind of parlays into single-family market from the perspective of Aimco. Imagine, single-family becomes more of a competitive factor in rental housing. First of all, do you agree with that? And second, do you think some of the other elements of tax reform, namely to cap some mortgage interest deductibility and property tax deductibility provide a material offset to this potential increase in single-family as a competitive threat to apartments?","Terry Considine","Rich, thank you very much. that\u2019s a good question; it reflects your usual focus on the big picture. I think that tax reform and the improving economy is good for single-family demand, not so much because of the rising income, although, I think that\u2019s important, but because higher interest rates will make it easier to cumulate down-payments. And that\u2019s been the block to demand, particularly at the entry level.","I think that the caps on deductibility won\u2019t materially affect that because most people at the entry level will have benefited from the standard deduction anyway. And so that -- it doesn\u2019t affect their -- the money they have available to pay debt service.","The impact on the apartment business will vary very much depending on the customers involved. If the customers involved are primarily young couples getting started, then, there will be very direct competition from single-family housing to pull those people out of two or three-bedroom apartments that you might see across the Sun Belt. But of course, we\u2019ve redeployed away from that. So, today, most of our apartments are in areas where the competitive single-family housing is quite high. And most -- about half of our customers are single occupants. So, they\u2019re just not as attracted to home purchases. But, there\u2019re plenty of apartments that will be subject to the discipline and the impact that you just asked about.","Operator","And our next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Buck Horne","I just wanted to drill down a little bit on some markets that you guys have a fairly positive outlook on for the coming year, but in which you do have some A priced properties, some high quality locations, in places like Los Angeles and San Diego and Miami, but where -- we think there\u2019s some growing supply pressure, you seem to have a feeling that you\u2019re going to kind of perform similar to last year with those supply pressures. Maybe walk us through how you have that comfort level and why you think you\u2019ll be able to perform similar to last year there.","Terry Considine","Buck, first of all, again, a terrific question, very thoughtful. I read your piece this morning and made a note about -- to look into CoreLogic and to be sure I understand their submarkets. Because what I touched on in my remarks and want to remind everyone on the call, is that supply is very local. And so, when people look at a market, for example our largest market Los Angeles and they say supply is up in Los Angeles, that is -- that can be true but irrelevant to Mid-Wilshire or to Calabasas if the supply is concentrated Staples. So, you\u2019re talking about broad areas, and it matters very much where that local supply increase is. As we sort through our portfolio, we think, as I said, about 20% of our capital will be challenged by competitive new supply. And that\u2019s probably up a little bit over last year but it\u2019s in the same zip code. And, in those areas, we have to work harder at customer satisfaction, customer retention, and manage your costs. And that\u2019s exactly what Keith did in 2017, it\u2019s exactly what we predict will happen in 2018.","Buck Horne","And I guess, secondly, did you have to take any impairments or write-downs on tax assets or other tax management related income due to the new legislation?","Paul Beldin","Hey, Buck, this Paul. Thank you for that question. As far as the impact of the tax legislation, just so everybody is clear, it impacts only two lines of our financial results for those of you that have the supplemental schedules handy, in our supplemental package, Scheduled 2 outlines our FFO by line item. And so we have two income tax related line items there. One is associated with historic tax benefits, the others are our other tax benefits. So, those are the only two items line items that are impacted by tax reform. And so, as we evaluated the impact of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, we are able to write down the liability for these deferred taxes that we\u2019ve incurred but not yet paid and that created a benefit, but then that caused us also to evaluate the deferred tax assets we had on our books and how we\u2019d be able to use those in the future. And so, the net of tax reform on our recorded assets and liabilities was about a net $500,000 benefit to FFO, which we\u2019ve excluded in the process of reporting pro forma FFO. So, fairly inconsequential.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Thank you all for your interest in Aimco.

[Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your presenter, Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Ms. Cohn, please go ahead.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you, Jamie. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgments, including projections related to 2012 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today. Also we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website. ","The participants on today's call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide opening remarks; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Ernie Freedman, our CFO, who'll review 2011 results and 2012 guidance. Also in the room today are John Bezzant, Executive Vice President, Transactions; Miles Cortez, EVP and Chief Administrative Officer; and Dan Matula, Executive Vice President of Redevelopment and Construction Services. We are all available to answer questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. ","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you on the call for your interest in Aimco. I'd like to take a few minutes at the beginning just to talk about the big picture. ","The apartment business was good last year, and I think it will be as good or better this year. Demographics remain strongly positive, and the economy seems to be slowly recovering. And I'm pretty sure that 2012 will be a very solid year for Aimco. About half of our expected rent growth is already in the bank from leases made last year and so far this year just waiting to earn in. Our renewal business remains quite steady, with more than half of our customers renewing their leases at rents up 5% and more. In most markets, we enjoyed steady consumer demand for new leases, pushing up average daily occupancy and producing higher rents.","Our portfolio is good and getting better. It is more and more concentrated in the most desirable markets, with higher rents and greater expected rent growth. Last year, average rents were up 9% to more than $1,140. This year, we expect average rents to be up another $120 or 10%, more than $1,260. About half of that increase in average rents will come from rent growth, and about half will come from the sale of properties with lower rents. ","We apply the same selling discipline to our Affordable portfolio, where we plan to sell 60 Affordable properties this year, reducing our allocation to the Affordable business to less than 10% of net asset value. ","On the buy side, we expect to make at least $200 million of property acquisitions, primarily by buying out limited partners in 11 partnerships that own 19 properties. We've already closed on 4 of these transactions, and we expect to close 3 more this month. We like partnerships acquisitions because we already operate the real estate and know it well. Partnership acquisitions are especially accretive where we can eliminate overhead costs. For example, all 7 of the transactions that we closed in January or expect to close in February are public partnerships, with all the costs of SEC reporting, required audits, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and so on, and that's a lot of costs to eliminate. So that's it. After this year, we'll be largely done with a decade of partnership acquisitions, and we will enjoy a simpler, more transparent, lower-cost business. So we're actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities, especially where we see that our operating and redevelopment skills can add value and enhance returns. ","Even as we upgrade our portfolio by selling weaker properties, we are also adding higher-rent, better-located properties through redevelopment. Over the next few years, redevelopment will be an important contributor to improve portfolio quality and to faster rent growth. We expect to have 8 redevelopments underway this year: 4 in coastal California and 4 others in Seattle, Chicago and Philadelphia. We expect to spend more than $400 million on these properties over the next 2 years or so with current returns on untrended rents greater than 7% and unlevered internal rates of return greater than 10%. ","Three: Treetops, which is now known as Pacific Bay Vistas, Lincoln Place and Madera Vista, are currently vacant. So the return to service of more than 1,200 units, with target rents over $2,400, will upgrade our portfolio and be especially accretive. Behind these, we have a deep pipeline of other good redevelopment opportunities for future years. ","We remain focused on simplifying our business and reducing costs. As I mentioned earlier, closing out 11 more property partnerships will save legal, accounting and other overhead costs. We've also agreed to sell NAPICO, a legacy asset management business, in a management buyout. While the final closing will be later this year after conditions are satisfied and regulatory approvals are received, overhead savings are already being realized. So once more, Aimco offsite costs will be down year-over-year this year by another 12% or $12 million. ","The Aimco balance sheet is liquid and safe. Our business is self-funding with ample liquidity, including a new $500 million unused revolving line of credit with an extended term and reduced pricing. We have limited near-term refunding obligations, largely fixed interest rates and essentially no debt with recourse to income. ","With property income increasing, retained earnings supplies to amortized property debt and opportunistic redemption of high-cost preferred stocks, we expect balance sheet leverage to come down over the next few years. For example, we expect the ratio of EBITDA to interest to be about 2.5:1 by the fourth quarter of the year. We expect the ratio of debt to EBITDA to be less than 7.5:1 by year end. ","In sum, we have a favorable environment, a clear plan and a veteran team that works well together. We expect 2012 to be a year of steady progress across all metrics. With this in mind, the Aimco board of directors voted yesterday to increase the common stock dividend by 50% to the annual rate of $0.72 per share. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Aimco Property Operations. Keith and his team are doing a great job, and I thank them for their hard work. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. We had a very solid year in 2011. And I'm exceptionally proud of the accomplishments of the team that I'm fortunate to lead. During 2011, we successfully increased rents and saw improvement year-over-year each quarter. We stayed disciplined about costs and actually reduced expenses both on and offsite year-over-year. We upgraded our technology, implemented a new property operating system and redesigned the Aimco website, thereby, enhancing the customer experience. And we retained a high percentage of our resident base by the prioritization of customer service and customer satisfaction. ","We finished 2011 on a positive note with Conventional Same Store fourth quarter NOI up 5.3% over the third quarter and up 5.8% year-over-year. This increase was driven by revenues being up 0.8% over the third quarter and up 3.3% year-over-year, while expenses were down 6.6% compared to the third quarter and down 1% year-over-year. ","Now for some additional context around the fourth quarter revenue numbers. Fourth quarter renewal rents were up 5.2%, and new lease rents were up 0.7% for a blended increase of 3%. In our target markets, which represent about 86% of our NOI, occupancy was stable and new lease rents were up 1.6%. ","In our non-target markets, we focused on gaining occupancy and getting to a strong jump-off point for 2012. After some softening in the -- early in the fourth quarter, demand strengthened. And we finished 2011 with high occupancy across the portfolio.  ","Average daily occupancy increased each week during the November and December to the year end of 95.7%. For the full year 2011, Conventional Affordable Same Store NOI was up 5.9% driven by revenues being up 2.9% and expenses being down 1.8%. ","Now for 2012. We began the new year in good shape, thanks to solid 2011 leasing activity, which will contribute 2.1% to the 2012 revenue growth, substantially better than the 0.4% we started with in 2011. January is on track, finishing according to plan. We remain highly focused on cost control. The expected increase year-over-year in expenses is entirely due to higher property taxes and property insurance costs. Utility expense increases are reimbursed by our customers. And in the aggregate, all expenses will be flat or down year-over-year, driven by operational efficiencies. ","Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the stellar work of my colleagues, particularly, Karyn Marasco and Kevin Mosher, the Area Vice Presidents of the East and West Property Operations. Proud to be part of a team so wholeheartedly dedicated to Aimco's vision. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, Keith. I'll provide some additional highlights from 2011 and discuss 2012 guidance. Keith provided 2011 highlights from operations, so I'll focus on our portfolio, redevelopments, balance sheet and financial results. ","John Bezzant and his Transactions team sold 151 properties in 2011. They sold 25 low-rated Conventional properties. These properties had an -- had average rents of $649 compared to our current portfolio today of $1,143. We also sold 45 Affordable properties, where our average ownership was 39%, and we continue to reduce the size of our third-party asset management activities to the sale of 81 NAPICO properties. The properties we retained have higher rents and higher expected rent and NOI growth. Importantly, capital replacement or CR spending is a smaller percentage of their revenue and is the case for lower-rent properties. ","As a result of the 2011 property sales, we expect free cash flow margin and AFFO to grow faster than NOI margin and FFO. ","Turning to redevelopment. Dan Matula and the team broke ground on our Pacific Bay Vistas redevelopment, started the first phase of our Lincoln Place redevelopment and have established a pipeline of projects lined up for starts in 2012 and 2013. Because 3 of these properties are presently vacant, we do not expect the redevelopment activity to be near-term dilutive to FFO and AFFO. We do expect it to be accretive in 2013 and beyond. ","Regarding the balance sheet. Our coverage has improved during 2011 due to earnings growth and a net reduction in debt. EBITDA coverage of interest increased to 2.18:1 from 2.07:1. EBITDA coverage of interest in preferred dividends also increased to 1.78:1 from 1.68:1. A detailed and supplemental Schedule 4 of our earnings release will reduce total leverage, which includes preferred stock, by $84 million. ","Patti Fielding and her team refinanced over $600 million of property debt maturing in the years 2011 through 2015 at rates averaging 4.9%. These loans mature on average in 9 years. Today, our property debt is helped by 46 insurance companies, pension funds, banks and other institutions in addition to the GSEs. Patti also increased our revolving credit facility, expanding the number of participants, ending the maturity dates to December 2016, inclusive of extension options and reducing its cost. In addition to lowering our total amount of preferred equity, we also issued a new class of preferred equity with a total -- with a coupon of 7%. Proceeds from this initial offering were used to redeem higher-cost preferred equity. ","The efforts of Keith, John, Dan, Patti and the entire Aimco team led to FFO up 11% year-over-year from 2010 and AFFO up by 5%. ","Turning to 2012, you'll find on Page 5 of our earnings release our detailed guidance for the full year 2012, as well as guidance for the first quarter. There's a lot of information there, so rather than reading the schedule to everyone, I'll just point out a few key items. ","Projected full year FFO is $1.72 to $1.82 per share. At the midpoint, this is an increase of about 8% from our 2011 FFO of $1.64. AFFO is anticipated to be up about 21% from 2011. FFO growth is driven primarily by expected revenue growth in lower offsite costs. AFFO was up more due to the levering effect of selling lower-rent assets that required similar amounts of capital replacement spending as the current portfolio. ","Our assumptions around operating results are as follows. Full year NOI growth for our Conventional Same Store portfolio is expected to be between 5.25% and 7.25%, with revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% and expense growth of 2.5% to 3%. Keith pointed out expense increases are due almost entirely to anticipated increases in property taxes and property insurance. While utility costs are also expected to increase, these increases will be offset by reimbursements from our customers. All other expense line items in the aggregate are expected to be flat or down. ","Regarding our balance sheet, we entered 2012 with $173 million of property debt maturities in the next 12 months. We have rate-locked $55 million of that amount, leaving us $118 million or about 2.5% of our total property debt remaining to refinance. ","Property debt amortization in 2012 will be $83 million or a little less than 2% of our property debt. We announced in our earnings release that we entered into an agreement to transfer asset management of our NAPICO portfolio effective February 6 and to sell our minority interest in the portfolio to the new asset manager upon satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory approvals. We expect the sale to close later in the second half of 2012. With this sale, we will have liquidated all of our legacy asset management business. In 2011, we generated less than $0.01 of FFO from our NAPICO relationship. And it's anticipated that for 2012, we'll generate a similar amount of FFO. ","On Page 4 of the earnings release, we discuss how we expect coverages to further improve during 2012 from our growth in operations and balance sheet activities. ","Annualizing our anticipated EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2012, we expect EBITDA coverage of interest expense to be approximately 2.5:1, EBITDA coverage of interest expense and preferred dividends to be approximately 2:1, debt to EBITDA of approximately 7.5x and debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of approximately 9x. ","I'm happy to report that we are off to a good start in all of these areas, and we are looking forward to a successful year ahead. ","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Jamie, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm just trying to understand the first quarter guidance a bit more. $0.35 implies a pretty big drop from the fourth quarter, so just wondering how you get from the fourth quarter down to $0.35 and then how that ramps back up through the year to get you to the $1.77?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Eric, this Ernie, and I'll walk you through the details on that. You'll note in our guidance we provided that we expect sequential NOI growth from our Conventional Same Store portfolio to be down at the midpoint about 3%. And that's mainly due to expenses. We do expect revenues to be up about $0.01, but we expect expenses to offset -- unfortunately, be down about $0.04. And that's just -- part of that is seasonal, as we go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, in terms of the utility costs. And part of that is just we had a very good expense quarter in the fourth quarter. Secondly, Eric, we had about $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 of nonrecurring income, and we're not projecting any nonrecurring income in the first quarter. That's another $0.02 going down for us. That gets you from our $0.41 to about $0.36, and there's a bunch of other small things that net out to about $0.01 being down. So that's how we expect to end up at $0.35 at the midpoint for the first quarter 2012. Regarding what happens then, Eric, for the rest of the year, I don't want to get ahead of myself and provide quarterly guidance going forward, but as you can see from what we're expecting from revenue growth and where we expect expenses to be in NOI for our whole portfolio, we do expect that operations to kick some strong contribution into gear for us as we finish out 2012. And then you also know in our guidance, we did provide guidance for nonrecurring revenues of about $6 million, which is a little bit more back-end weighted in our numbers, and that's how we\u2019ll see our FFO contribution ramp up in the second, third and fourth quarter.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then in thinking about the $0.13 of dilution that you provided, I think from the property sales in 2011, 2012, how much of that is just from the sale of the Asset Management portfolio? And I know you said you didn't want to say when the sale was going to occur, but I'm trying to figure out how dilutive that transaction, in particular, is going to be, and so we can sort of carry that forward into the coming years.","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. The Asset Management portfolio will have virtually no impact on the dilution. In 2011, we earned about $0.01 or a little bit less than $0.01 from the activities from NAPICO, and it's a similar amount in 2012, as we are expecting that to be in our numbers for most of the year. So I don't want to talk about too much about what would happen for the future years, other than the fact that it's only $0.01 in 2012, so it won't have a big difference. I think it's important, Eric, to point out -- you're right to point out in our numbers that you see that there's a dilution from asset sales of $0.13. But offsetting that is the reduction in expenses across the organization of $0.09. So on state, it sounds like our sale activity is quite dilutive, but we save a lot of money as we simplify the company, we take out costs, and we reduce our scale. And when you really net those 2 numbers, you can see that even with all the asset sales we've had, it hasn't been that dilutive for us on an overall basis. And going forward, we would expect something similar with the sales that we're contemplating in 2012. And the fact is as we contemplate those sales, we have the opportunity to continue to save costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the delevering plans. It looked like to me the debt-to-EBITDA target number went down from when we spoke in November to today. Can you just talk about, if that's the case, what's driving that decision to de-lever more quickly?","Ernest M. Freedman","Karin, this is Ernie. What I'd say is we're not too different from the plans we\u2019ve talked with folks about when we provided a presentation publicly of our NAREIT presentation from a few weeks -- from actually a few months ago. What's happening there is we're very focused on getting our coverages more in line with where our peers are, and we wanted to provide some guide posts for those folks as to where that's coming in. I'll point out the numbers that I mentioned. They're both in the release and my script, and we're annualizing the fourth quarter numbers. And we did talk to folks before. We provided both annualized numbers, as well as the trailing 12 numbers and, of course, with our growth that we're going to have in EBITDA throughout the year, on a trailing 12 basis, we don't get quite as far as we do on the annualized numbers, but that's where we'll be going forward. So there really hasn\u2019t been a material plans and changes in terms of what we want to do with leverage, other than that we want to make sure people understand that we're focused on that, and we wanted to -- we're committed to continue to improve our coverages both through typical recovery of NOI, as well as bringing our overall debt balances down, as well as the costs of that debt term.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Second question just relates to the dispositions and, I guess, the acquisitions as well. Can you talk about the timing and the cap rates that you're expecting on both the sales and something you might acquire this year?","Ernest M. Freedman","Karin, I'll ask John Bezzant to talk about what we're looking at around dispositions and acquisitions. Go ahead, John.","John Bezzant","Sure. Timing, I think, you\u2019ll see it spread throughout the year. I won't say ratably exactly quarter by quarter, but you'll see it spread through the year. On the acquisition front, it's noted in earlier remarks that our partnership activities, some of it is already taking place. We'll continue to close some more in this coming month and over the course of the remainder of the year, as we identify acquisition opportunities. We'll see how they arise, and when the timing comes to bear.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just cap rates?","John Bezzant","Cap rates, very similar to what you saw this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","How much did you pay the buyer to buy NAPICO? Did you give any of the math behind that transaction yet?","Terry Considine","Rich, this is Terry. We'll give you the details on the purchase once it closes. I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But it's a management-led buyout. It's a -- the company will finance it. But the management team is going to come up with the amount of equity -- a significant amount of equity to them, and the price makes sense to us.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So you're out of the tax credit business?","Terry Considine","No. The NAPICO was not a tax credit entity. NAPICO was a syndicator previously owned by Casden. We acquired that in the Casden transaction a decade ago, and it both institutional and retail investors for whom it provided asset management services.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I thought they did tax credit stuff, too, but I must be wrong about that. Okay, so\u2026","Ernest M. Freedman","Rich, just a follow-up here on Terry with regards to tax credit, of course, when sell some of our legacy tax credit deals that we've done under the Aimco umbrella, I just want to -- I'm cautious to use the word business. For us, it\u2019s a financing opportunity. And as we\u2019ve talked about, we're selling a lot of our Affordable assets. And we think in the next couple of years, we'll be down to just a handful other than our legacy tax credit deals. We may choose at some point in the future to use tax credit to finance redevelopment on some of those. But in terms of trying to generate large syndication fees, et cetera, that's not the goal of that, of what we're trying to accomplish or what we're looking for, cost-effective financing to do redevelopments. And there may be 1 or 2 of those we do a year, but to call it a business would be a little bit of a misnomer.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I'm sorry I'm getting my signals crossed in the various entities there. And then a separate second question on CapEx. You kind of go through your capital expenditures on redevelopment and upgrades, but what can you say about recurring capital expenditures on a per-unit basis? What do you expect to spend during 2012? And how does that compare to 2011?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. We provided guidance, Rich, around what we were going to do around redevelopment and property upgrades. On a recurring basis, we do expect to spend about $1,200 of capital per door, of which about $900 to $950 of that is capital replacement, and the rest of that is capital improvements, where we do get a little bit of revenue uplift. And that's been consistent for the last couple of years. With times getting better and customers going to pay more rent, we have pushed for more property upgrades the last couple of years. And similar to last year, we're looking to spend about $30 million to $40 million in addition to that approximate $1,200 a door.","Operator","Our next question comes from Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just trying to reconcile, I think, the new leases, which you showed here as 0.7%. In October, you mentioned it was 3%, I think, over expiring leases. Just wondering what was the numbers in November and December. And then sort of how is it trending for the new year?","Keith Kimmel","Swaroop, this is Keith. I'll take that question. Swaroop, first of all, let me just reference back to my prepared remarks, particularly around that 86% of our net operating income comes from our target markets, where we had stable occupancy at 95.6% occupied, and our rents were up 1.6%, more than double the average. In our other markets, we focused on building occupancy and getting a strong jump-off point for 2012. And as we finished out January, we're on plan. And more particularly, as we look into February and March, we're starting to see early renewal rates being accepted in north of 5%.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And are you seeing more sensitivity to these renewal increases between sort of the A\u2019s and the B\u2019s -- I mean, sort of B- in your portfolio? And can you also talk about the traffic trends you're seeing and generating?","Keith Kimmel","Sure, Swaroop. On the sensitivities, we're not seeing any particular sensitivities across the different A, B\u2019s or C\u2019s. And traffic is up, and we're feeling good about business and right on track.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Could you answer that to the last question, what are you doing on new move-ins over the course of the last 2 months of 4Q and into this year?","Keith Kimmel","Dave, I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","What are your new move-in increases in November, December and January?","Keith Kimmel","Oh, as those were in the prepared remarks, we were at 0.7% in aggregate. But what I was referring to is that the 85% of our NOI that really is to our target markets, those came in at 1.6%.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. Just trying to understand better what's going on, on the new lease side. When we look at the fourth quarter this year, you had 0.7%. That's actually below what you did in 4Q '10 on new leases, although you were much stronger on renewals. And the 0.7% certainly suggests a drop-off from the October level that you talked about last quarter. So could you just talk about new lease pricing in general? Because your guidance at least at the top end suggests that you\u2019ll have to get back to second or third quarter levels of increases from last year pretty quickly.","Keith Kimmel","Dave, let me just say it this way. We solve for total revenue. And so while we're focused on new lease price, we're also focused on renewals and the blend of those 2, so that's how we're solving it.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","But can you talk a little bit more about the level of traffic or underlying drivers of weaker new lease pricing over the last few months as compared to October?","Ernest M. Freedman","Dave, this is Ernie. Keep in mind, we're not just solving for maximum new lease pricing or maximum renewal pricing. It's also a big component of this within occupancy as well. And we grew occupancy more in the fourth quarter than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the October call. Keith talked about it really is kind of a tale of 2 portfolios for us in terms of the -- our target market portfolio and our non-target market portfolio, and Keith addressed that. And we did see that the pricing fell off a little bit more in the non-target markets, which makes about 14% of our NOI, but we grew occupancy significantly and that to put us in a strong position for starting 2012. On an overall basis, and I think similar to what other folks have been reporting for new lease rates in the fourth quarter, our numbers on an aggregate basis were about where those folks were. And in fact, in our target portfolios, it was toward the top end of that. That's carried over into January, where we see things get modestly better, but we haven't seen any spike in new lease rates from where they are at today. But without providing guidance, Dave, to what's going to happen in the second, third and fourth quarters, specifically around renewal and new lease rates, we do expect for the year that on a blended basis, we\u2019re going to be north of 5% on those. And as you can see from our numbers in the fourth quarter, we are there already for renewals, but it will be a lot of hard work to make sure we stay there for renewals and, hopefully, do even better. And as you saw in our numbers during 2011, we had a pretty big spike in new lease rates as we got into the summer peaking season and then trended down, which I think was very similar to almost everyone in the industry. I'm not going to say that 2012 is going to play out exactly like that, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it has a trend similar to that.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","All right. And let's focus on D.C. for a second. Could you talk about your outlook for that market as compared to your broader 4.5% to 5.5% revenue growth forecast?","Keith Kimmel","Dave, let me just kind of walk through our D.C.  market. Revenues were up 5.1% from last year. And as you may know, we have on average a B portfolio in Washington. Most of our properties are around the Beltway, both suburban Virginia and Maryland, and we anticipate another strong year in 2012 there.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Can you quantify that as compared to the portfolio?","Ernest M. Freedman","Dave, we don't -- we haven\u2019t provided guidance on a specific market-by-market basis on how that adds up to our expectations overall at 4.5% to 5.5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan from Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was curious if the disposition for next year kind of get you where you want to be in terms of your target NOI for the Affordable portion of your portfolio or whether you'll continue kind of calling that going forward.","Ernest M. Freedman","Particularly with our disposition guidance, it gets us closer. We're going to get to -- eventually, to a point where it's less than 10% of our NOI and NAV, and we're getting close to that but not quite there in 2012. I expect there'd be -- if we don't get it done in 2012, another maybe 20 to 25 more properties to sell as we go into 2013. So what I'd tell you is we're almost there. As we sell these properties, it doesn't make a big change in its contribution because these are our Affordable properties with the lowest ownership percentage across our portfolio. And then longer term, we continue to expect Affordable to become a smaller and smaller contributor to our -- the overall Aimco picture in terms of NAV, as well as NOI. So we\u2019ve talked about wanting to be at 10% or a little bit less, and we're going to be almost there with what we plan to do in 2012.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then I guess kind of bigger picture, given the kind of current platform you have, what do you think is the appropriate size for the company?","Terry Considine","Jana, it's Terry. I think we're roughly $10 billion. That's a comfortable size. We've been larger at other times. It'd be okay if we were a little bit larger. We've been smaller at times, and that would be okay, too. It's the size where transactions and improved performance can move the dial, and so I like this size, about where it is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Ernie, given the fact that you were able to issue preferred at just under 7.25%, I mean, where does that need to be in order for you to basically swap out new issuance for the $600 million of redeemable issues at 7.75% to 8% that you guys have?","Ernest M. Freedman","Rich, it's a good question. We're getting closer to where that might make some sense for us. But keep in mind on the prepared ATMs, the cost to do a transaction is only 2%, and unfortunately, the investment bankers look for more if we're going to do a bigger offering. And so the math isn't quite there at that higher expense, but if there's anyone out there listening who'd like to offer up a lower amount, I'd be happy to take that phone call either now or as soon as we finish this call. So the math needs to be closer to 100 basis points for it to work on a larger offering, Rob, for it to make sense, to offset those transaction costs. We\u2019re very happy with how the ATMs performed. We continue to get shares up out there, and it's a good trade for us to be able to issue at about 7.20-or-so yield and take out 8% for paper.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then where was unit turnover for the fourth quarter and for the year? And what's implied in your guidance for '12?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, this is Keith. Unit turnover for the year was a little bit more than the previous year. And this coming year, in 2012, we anticipate it to be on par with 2011.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. Do you guys have, though, what the actual figure was though?","Keith Kimmel","It was just about 40%. 43%, actually.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","43% turnover for the year?","Keith Kimmel","Yes.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And what was it for the fourth quarter?","Keith Kimmel","I don't have that information right at my fingertips, Rob.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay, we\u2019ll follow up later.","Keith Kimmel","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question, Terry, you quoted the returns discs for the 3 projects. Were those -- was that on impaired land values or unimpaired land values? If it was on impaired values, can you give us what it was on the unimpaired values?","Ernest M. Freedman","Mike, this is Ernie. Let me address that. The returns that Terry gave are for all the redev projects that we're going to be doing, not just the 3 that -- and 2 of those had impairments associated with those. What I can tell you is we haven't -- so we haven't provided on a specific project-by-project basis what those would be. I can tell you, though, that from the real estate values we're covering, the returns on the unimpaired values on those projects are only about 100 to 200 basis points less than what we're expecting based on the impaired values. But as we get further out, we provided some guidance around Pacific Bay Vistas in an earnings release a few weeks ago. As we get a little further along on Lincoln Place, which is the other major redevelopment project that had an impairment a few years ago, we\u2019ll provide that kind of information, too. I just want to be clear with folks that -- what the project returns are when you look at it both ways.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second one is a 3-parter. Can you talk about what your -- you gave the same store numbers for the Conventional portfolio. What's the same-store expectations for the Affordable portfolio in 2012? Also what is the number you're budgeting for real estate tax increases in 2012? And what the impact of selling off the Asset Management business would have, if any, on the asset management fee income that you guys recognize?","Ernest M. Freedman","On the Affordable, we expect Affordable to be up -- Affordable Same Store up about -- from flat to up 1%. That's mainly driven by a revenue increase but a little less of an increase than we saw in 2011 because we had some larger Affordable projects that had the rents -- their 5-year rents studies [ph] come up, and we got a nice bump. We're not going to see that in 2012. And then expenses behaved similarly in the Affordable portfolio, maybe a little bit more growth than we have in our Conventional portfolio. So Affordable will be up 0% to 1%, the Affordable Same Store portfolio. Real estate tax is embedded in our guidance is an assumption is real estate taxes will increase between 5% and 6%, and that\u2019s for the Conventional Same Store portfolio year-over-year. Within that number, Mike, 3.5% of the 5% to 6% is due to our expectation that both assessments and\/or tax rates are going to go up year-over-year. The other part then -- the part that's not the 3.5%, so roughly the 1.5% to 2.5%, that increase is due to the fact that we do expect we'll have less successful appeals on prior year taxes in 2012 than we had in 2011. So again, real estate taxes, embedded in our guidance, we're assuming to go up 5% to 6% on a comparable basis. Finally, with the Asset Management business. That's only going to contribute about $0.01 to us overall in 2012. Basically, the revenues almost offset the expenses for that business. And then actually that business is something that's taxed. It\u2019s in our TRF as well. There's a tax expense associated with any profits from that. So we basically expect that revenues we generate before taxes are offset more or less by expenses to run those assets. And then there's a minor tax expense associated with those that brings it down to a little bit less than $0.01.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So the impact would be then in the investment management. It wouldn't impact your property management, and it's not impacting G&A?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes, that's correct, Mike. We provided in our guidance, guidance around both recurring revenues and nonrecurring revenues. It's going to impact mainly the recurring revenue number going forward. That would come down a little bit because of that management fees go away, and then we lift out recurring expenses and nonrecurring expenses in our guidance for investment management. So you're exactly right. All the impact is just within that area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering with the recent dispositions, I don\u2019t know if you -- do you have an update in terms of what your Conventional portfolio looks like on a rent-to-income basis when you look at your current tenant base? And also I just wondered if you have an update on the number of people that you had moving out to buy a home in the quarter.","Terry Considine","Buck, on -- it's Terry. On the first question about rent-to-income, I think that's a very good piece of data, and we've been tracking it for about a year, but I don't think we have it quite in usable form, so I hope to report that in future quarters. But let me just say, in general, our customer is not income-constrained about rent increases, but I don't have a good quality number to give you.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the percentage of people moving out to buy a home?","Terry Considine","Yes, Keith, has that information.","Keith Kimmel","Sure, Buck. This is Keith. Most recently, we've been trending between 13% and 15%, which is down from the high of the housing boom of north of 22%.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No major changes in that trend recently?","Keith Kimmel","No. Nothing.","Terry Considine","No major or minor changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry for the follow-up, but I thought maybe it would be helpful to just get a snapshot of what Aimco will look like a year from now after you go through your dispositions. And so in listening to you, debt to EBITDA of 7.5x, Conventional business being 85% or thereabouts versus Affordable being 15%, 0 partnership business in the Conventional portfolio, pretty much. Is that about right? Do I have that reasonable snapshot of what things would look like?","Terry Considine","Close, Rich, but let's just go back over that because I think that's a useful way to look at it, and it's the way I look at it is trying to be very clear about where we're going. And so the first part about the Conventional business that I would flag is that we expect the average rents at year end to be about $1,260 a month. Secondly, we expect that to be about 90% of our net asset value. Third, we expect to have about 4% or 5% of our GAV, so make that maybe 10% of our NAV invested in redevelopment at untrended rents providing 7% -- more than 7% current returns and unlevered IRRs greater than 10%. We expect almost no partnerships, almost -- no asset management. Offsite costs down by another 12% or $12 million and debt to EBITDA, less than 7.5:1.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What about third-party property management?","Terry Considine","We have essentially none.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And that goes down every time you buy a partnership out?","Terry Considine","Correct. The allocation that is reported would be more with respect to our owned limited partners and not to a completely unrelated third party.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So if Conventional is 90% of NAV and redevelopment is 10% of NAV and -- but you still have some Affordable, how do you get 110% of NAV?","Terry Considine","Because the redevelopment piece comes against the conventional 90%.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just kind of wanted to follow up on Dave Bragg's question. You did 4.2% in weighted average rent growth in 2011 which, like you mentioned in your remarks, locks in about 50% of your revenue growth or 210 basis points of the 5% that you're predicting for this year. So just logically, right, you would have to be expecting 6% rent growth for this year for your -- the math to work out to get to that 5% revenue growth number, right? Or is there something -- is there a piece of it I'm missing because the occupancy\u2026","Ernest M. Freedman","There's a couple of things, Eric. I know our occupancy guidance says we're going to come in relatively close to where we're at in 2012, but we'll see how that plays out. And in addition, about 10% of our income comes from other income, not from rents. It comes from things we bill back to our customers, when they pay for extra things like parking, storage, et cetera, and we continue to think that we have the opportunity to grow that at a pace quicker than we're growing rent. Now that said, it's only 10%, but that also will be a positive accretive to us and -- otherwise, I would agree with your math. And we're talking about, we have to be north of 5%, so that would coincide with your -- the math that you said that we would need to be closer to 6%. I'm not going to say exactly what number we think we're going to get to, and it could be a trade of occupancy and rate as we go through the year. We'll see how the circumstances will play itself out. But we're confident that we're going to come within a range of 4.5% to 5.5% and wanted to lay that marker out there, knowing that almost -- like you pointed out, Eric, that almost half of that is already baked in.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And I think Michael had a quick one as well.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, Ernie, just looking on Page 6 of the release, and you have the FFO reconciliation. Can you just walk through -- you have this $0.13, and you title it '11 and '12 asset sales net of reinvestment, and I was just wondering, can you walk through how you came up with that $0.13? You obviously had growth dispositions last year of about $370 million, 40% of which happened in the fourth quarter. And it looks like you're targeting, net of reinvestment, about $330 million to $430 million of dispos this year, net of the acquisitions and the partnership interests. So I'm just trying to think about how you came up with that $0.13 of dilution. How much of it is effectively from '11 and how much of it is from '12 and how you went through the math?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Mike, well, I don't have the details in front of me. It's difficult [ph] to say this much came from '11 and this much came from '12, but you walked through exactly the logic associated with it, as well we're netting against the fact -- it's a small acquisition. We did -- we had a couple -- we had a small acquisition in June of last year. We're getting some income generating from that. So I'm happy to take it offline with you to provide you some more details on how we get to the $0.13, but basically, as you just described, the sales from 2011, we had a big bunch of them close in December, so those are going to be quite dilutive to us because we had almost a full year earnings of those in 2011. The sales in 2012 are assumed to be, as John talked about, not quite ratable, but they will be spread out through the year. And based on our expectations for what we would sell those at from a cap rate, the math just worked out to be $0.13. But I just, unfortunately, I don't have it in front of me exactly how much is related to '11 and '12, but I'm happy to share that with you offline.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How much debt do you have on the $550 million to $650 million, and what rate is that debt at?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes, those are levered very similar to the rest of our portfolio. So on a property debt perspective, they're between 50% and 55%. Some will be a little higher, some will be a little bit lower. And those are at rates that are generally north of 5.5% because they\u2019re older loans, so usually between 5.5% and 6%.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And that was for the sales last year as well? The $195 million of debt was around that rate?","Ernest M. Freedman","The leverage was consistent on those sales as well in 2011.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you show this -- you talked about this $0.09 in terms of the offsite costs including G&A. Looking at the G&A, and I assume the stuff on Page 5, this is at your pro rata share in terms of the full year guidance or is it at your consolidated share?","Ernest M. Freedman","No, this ties to what we have in Supplemental Schedule 1, which would be our proportionate numbers. So you're correct, Mike.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the G&A number is down about $3 million, right? So for $0.09, you need to save $11 million year-over-year. So $3 million of that is G&A. Where is the other $8 million coming out of on the P&L? Where are you saving $8 million?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. If I can point you to Supplemental Schedule 1b, let's just go through that with everyone so they can hear it. You\u2019ll see 3 line items on Supplemental Schedule 1b, which is our year-end, December 31, expenses. So the first line item I\u2019d point you to is the total...","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sorry, what page number?","Ernest M. Freedman","It will be Page 13 in our Supplemental Schedule 1b. You'll see a line about halfway down for property management expenses under property operating expenses, and that's $41.4 million for 2011. Our guidance is $35 million for 2012, so that's a $6 million difference. Investment management expenses in about 5 lines below that. And the investment management expenses in 2011 were $10.4 million. We're guiding to $8 million, which is the combination of recurring expenses and nonrecurring expenses on Page 5, in our asset management and tax credit activity section. That's another $2 million of savings. And the rest is the number that you mentioned with G&A, Michael.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. And now, this is -- effectively, what's going to be the annualized rate of all these savings? I assume this is not sort of happening day one, that you'll start seeing this benefit into 2013. But just trying to think about where do you sort of end the year when all is said and done from an accretion dilution standpoint from all this stuff?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, there's definitely an earn-in because there will be sales activity throughout the year, but I don't want to tie myself to being too specific, Michael, as to what that could be because we're hopeful other things could happen in the business that could change our outlook on expenses with regards to -- if we found the right acquisitions, do other things. So the answer is yes. There is some earn-in both from the fact that our 2012 sales will have some dilution into 2013. But our savings will not quite offset that. We'll come close to offsetting that on an FFO basis. Importantly, on an AFFO basis, that offsets it completely because of the levering effect of the capital spend.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew McCulloch from Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the redevelopment comments. Are you going to have 10% of your portfolio undergoing some sort of redevelopment in '12, or have you identified 10% of your portfolio that is targeted for redevelopment over several years? And then if you can expand -- just give us a little bit of color on what type of redevelopment you're talking about, whether it's full scale repositioning, where you're taking entire assets offline? Or are you talking more redev-light, where you're doing work on term?","Terry Considine","Andrew, it's Terry. And I want to go back in that 10% and walk it back just a little bit because it will depend on the timing over the next couple of years of when that is under construction. But just to walk through the big -- the 8 projects that we're describing there, 3 of them are currently empty. And the average spend on those, which are Treetops, Lincoln and Madera Vista, Dan, is probably $100,000 a unit?","Daniel S. Matula","Yes, probably $150,000.","Terry Considine","$150,000 a unit, okay? So quite substantial. We're not prepared to give guidance about Seattle, Chicago and Philadelphia, but those again will be quite substantial. We'll have some lesser, more redev-light areas that are not included in those 8, which will be more in the nature of $10,000 or $15,000.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then can you just go over what the expected yield on that, that you're expecting? Sorry, you cut out for some reason.","Terry Considine","I'm sorry. Yes, we said it in -- I guess, I said in my prepared remarks, current returns are expected to be north of 7%, unlevered IRRs. On untrended rents, north of 10%.","Operator","And our next question comes from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the board's decision on the dividend. It looks like based on the midpoint of your AFFO guidance for this year, it's roughly a 59% payout. And I know your plan is to use some of the retained cash to amortize debt. Is -- do you think that 60% payout ratio is roughly where the board wants to stay, and do you plan to continue that strategy? Or should we expect down the road that, potentially, there might be room for dividend increases greater than earnings growth because that payout ratio is still pretty low?","Terry Considine","Karin, I think the board will look at it -- again, they look at it every quarter, but they basically make an annual decision. And we'll discuss it and compare it to all of the context and other uses of corporate funds. The decision-making this year focused on adding a significant increase in the dividend, reflecting the prospects for the company but balancing it against an interest in retaining cash to amortize property debt and reduce the leverage in the company somewhat.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And just one other one. Can just talk about what you're seeing in Los Angeles? I know it's a big market for you. It looked like you were not getting as much sequential momentum there, I guess, as some others had seen. Can you just talk about what kind of conditions you're seeing on the ground there?","Keith Kimmel","Sure, Karin. This is Keith. Let me start by stating that we look at Los Angeles in 2 different segments. We first look at the west side of Los Angeles as one. And then the outer LA markets, Simi Valley, Saugus, different markets on the -- in the peripheral. Particularly when we look at the west side of Los Angeles, that's where we carry our A products. And as many of you may have had an opportunity to visit them and see them, we would say that those are the communities that we believe have the greatest upside, particularly as we go into 2012.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Great. Thank you very much. And in closing, I'd like to go back to Rich Anderson's question because I thought he framed it exactly right, so thank you, Rich. And it\u2019s focused on where we expect the company to be at the end of this year. We expect to have a good year with the revenue up north of 5%. About half of that's in the bank, and our renewal business is more than half of the remainder, and those rents continue to grow at about 5% or more. We expect average rents to be about $1,260 a month by the end of the year. We expect the Affordable business to be less than 10% of our net asset value. We expect to close out public partnerships and private partnerships on the Conventional side, significantly reducing costs and increasing transparency. We expect to start 8 redevelopments, as we just discussed with Andrew, with 7% current returns, unlevered IRRs north of 10% of untrended rents and to have a deep pipeline of other opportunities besides -- behind that. We expect offsite costs to be down year-over-year by another 12% or $12 million. And we expect our balance sheet to end with debt to EBITDA of less than 7.5:1 at year end. So we've got a year of good progress ahead for us, a lot of work to do. And we thank you for your interest in the company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call.

Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Jeremy Metz","Operator","Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Apartment Investment and Management Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2013 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in Charge of Property Operations; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO. We are available to answer questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","And I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa. And good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco.","Business is good. Aimco had a solid first quarter to start the year. The big picture that I'd like to communicate is this, the Aimco team is systematically executing the plan that Ernie and I have laid out to you over the past few years. This plan covers 5 main areas: Property operations, portfolio management, redevelopment, balance sheet and simplicity. Let me walk through a few particulars in each of these.","In property operations, while we'll hear from Keith in a few minutes a detailed report in the first quarter, I would like to direct your attention to 2 specifics. First, our same-store revenue growth rate is higher this year than last, up 50 basis points from 4.2% to 4.7%. Second, our same-store property expenses before taxes, insurance and utility costs are flat year-over-year and are actually down for the past 5 years, a remarkable accomplishment in cost control.","Next, in portfolio management, we remain committed to a portfolio that is broadly diversified amongst coastal and job growth markets, and across price points averaging BB+ with the belief that this diversification will provide more predictable results over the business cycle. When we make investments, we follow a paired trade discipline explicitly comparing what we expect to buy to what we plan to sell. We have been conservative about acquisitions, but we do expect that we will make some investments to reduce our allocation to non-core markets and to improve our locations within core markets.","Here are 2 important results. First, average revenues per unit are up 8% year-over-year and are up 20% over the past 3 years. Second, we continue our exit from the Affordable business and have sold more than 100 Affordable Properties in the last 3 years.","Next, in redevelopment, we expect to invest $130 million to $160 million this year with yields about 7%, assuming untrended rents and about 8% at the rents expected at stabilization of these projects in the next year or 2. And these will have free cash flow internal rates of return north of 10%. These 8 projects underway this year are expected to generate about $2 per share of net asset value at stabilization.","Turning to our balance sheet. Our leverage is in line with peers and in fact considering its long duration, nonrecourse nature and the absence of a large construction pipeline, Aimco's balance sheet is safer than the industry average. As Ernie will detail in his remarks, we are on track to meet our goal of leverage-to-EBITDA of less than 7 to 1 by early next year, and we expect to end next year with a leverage ratio in the mid-6s. This improvement based on rising property income and debt amortized from retained earnings also leads to lower interest expense, adding a few cents a year to our bottom line.","Finally, our business is simple. We have a clear plan, a high quality of earnings with limited nonrecurring income and a high level of transparency. Our management team is cohesive, collaborative and having fun. We are pleased that the Denver Post recently recognized Aimco as one of the top places to work in our state. It's my great pleasure to work with a talented team, not only here in Colorado, but across the entire country.","In this steady progress across all areas of our plan translates in the bottom line. Year-over-year, first quarter FFO is up 20%, first quarter AFFO is up 31% and the first quarter dividend is up 33%.  Looking to the full year, Ernie is raising FFO and AFFO guidance to a full year 10% increase in FFO and 15% increase in AFFO. Net asset value is increasing similarly and smartly. And as you know we base our dividend on AFFO, so you can look for continued dividend growth in 2014.","In sum, business is good. We're working hard to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions, and we're making solid progress to position Aimco for the longer term.","Now for a more detailed report on first quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. We're off to a good start in 2013. Our on-site teams continue to consistently provide excellent customer service to our residents. And as result, we achieved renewal rate increases of 5.3%, 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year. Of those leases that expired and were not renewed, new leases were signed at rates that were on average 2.6% higher than the expiring leases. An improvement of 60 basis points over the first quarter of last year.","As a result of our team's hard work, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.9% for the quarter, some 50 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year. Of the customers that decided to move out, 22% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. We continue to be successful in replacing move outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average income of those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was $100,000. The median income was $63,000 and had a rent-to-income ratio of 21%.","Our operations teams also continue to find innovative ways of showcasing our distinctive products and services to provide additional value for our customers, while generating other income growth of 13.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. With this solid execution, first quarter Conventional same store revenue was up 4.7% year-over-year and up 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter.","Looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up 2\/3 of our revenue, the top 3 performers had revenue increases from over 6% to nearly 9% for the quarter. This was led by the Bay area, followed by Miami and Chicago. Our steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth from 4% to 6% were Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Orange County and Washington, D.C. And rounding up the 10 largest markets in the 3% range, we have Philadelphia and San Diego.","As we look ahead, we're building upon our first quarter successes with a solid April, establishing an expectation of a strong leasing season. April blended lease rates were up 4.2%, with new lease rates up 3.4% and renewals up 5.1%. April's average daily occupancy was 95.6%, on plan and solid progression from the first quarter. May and June renewal offers went out with a 6% to 9% increase.","And with great thanks to our entire Aimco team, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, Keith. Pro forma FFO of $0.48 per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04, primarily due to $0.01 of stronger-than-expected results in our non-same store Conventional portfolio and a bit less than $0.03 from the sale of one of our Affordable assets that generated a pay off on a fully reserved loan, which is recognized in interest income.","Operating results for our same-store portfolio in the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Our average rent per unit was up 4.4% over last year, while other income went up 13.5%, leading to an increase in revenue per unit of 5.3%. Total revenue was up 4.7% as we had a year-over-year decline in average occupancy of 60 bps. Year-over-year occupancy comps eased throughout the rest of 2013 compared to 2012.","Operating expenses increased 4.9% over last year. Real estate taxes, insurance and utilities combined were up almost 10%, while the net of all other expenses were flat. Insurance costs, in particular, were higher than anticipated due to a few high severity health insurance claims. Better performance in utility costs from the mild winter helped to offset this.","On the portfolio management front, asset sales during the quarter were on plan with the sale of 3 Affordable Properties. We continue to expect that 2013 asset sales will be heavily weighted toward the end of the year, reflecting the extended closing schedule associated with the sale of Affordable Properties, as well as the timing of opportunities to reinvest the proceeds from asset sales.","As Terry mentioned, we intend to sell most of our Affordable Properties, not subject to tax credit agreements in the near term, and our remaining Affordable Properties over the next several years, as the tax credit agreement expires. With this in mind, we have modified our definition of Affordable Same Store properties to exclude those not subject to tax agreements -- tax credit agreements.","So as you look at our portfolio, you can think of the Affordable Same Store properties as those that will wind down over the next several years, and the other Affordable Properties as those we intend to sell in the near term.","Looking ahead, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance by $0.02 at the lower end, upper end of our guidance range, which takes into account our stronger first quarter results. For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.45 to $0.49 per share, with the year-over-year Conventional same-store NOI growth projected to be 4.4% to 5%. Second quarter Conventional same store NOI is projected to be up 1.5% to 2.5% compared to the first quarter.","For the remainder of the year, we anticipate third quarter FFO to improve slightly from the second quarter, with growth coming from sequential improvement in operations. The fourth quarter is expected to have a significant improvement over the third quarter, as we anticipate further and larger gains in sequential operations results. Also, as we noted in our initial guidance, we will have some benefit from nonrecurring revenues occurring in the fourth quarter.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Amy, I'll turn it over to you for the first the question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You noted in your comments that your revenue growth in 1Q '13 was higher than it was in '12, and it looks like that held true for how much you guys were pushing rents in 1Q '13. So it's fairly unique, relative to the rest of your apartment peers. What do you think is different about Aimco that's allowing you to do that?","Terry Considine","Karin, I think you just made us all pause and catch our breath to think about it. We focused each day and each week property-by-property and unit by unit type trying to find the right price or rental rate that will optimize the margin contribution. So it's balancing both the revenue received and the cost avoided. And with a diversified portfolio, we look for greater steadiness and predictability. We like where we are. The renewal rates have been quite steady in this plus or minus 5% range for the last couple of years, and we'd expect our revenue to come in consistent with guidance.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. My second question is on the GSEs and their plans to pull back on the multi-family lending side. Could you just talk about what impact, looking forward, do you think that might have on cap rates and does that potentially hit Class B and C properties more so than Class A properties?","Terry Considine","Karin, I think any reduction in participation by any lender, certainly, ones as large as the GSEs will have some impact across both cap rates and interest rates available at all price points. But I think the effect will be largely muted, as you well know that the world is awash in liquidity right now. For Aimco we have a significant amount of our borrowings with non-GSE lenders. And for the moment we don't expect a material impact in the forecast horizon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a question on the redevelopment pipeline. And for the 6 projects you have, it looks like you pushed out stabilization for 4 of them a couple of quarters. I was just curious why that was? And then also it looks like the expected costs went up a bit?","Terry Considine","Jana, this is Terry. I would say that the push out is because we were just taking a little bit longer to get it done. And I would say that's also the case about the costs. We don't see significant cost increases in terms of construction cost inflation. It's just as we work through it, we're finding we're just a tick optimistic in our estimates. But what I would come back and emphasize is that those projects taken as a whole would have 7% yield today at today's untrended rates, 8% expected at stabilization and double-digit free cash flow internal rates of return.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Bragg at Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just to follow-up on that question a little more specifically. Can you talk about Pacific Bay Vistas. You've had cost increases there before, but this quarter was significant. Is it that you're continuing to address the issues you've highlighted before as part of this more offensive and that you see higher rent rates as a result?","Terry Considine","David, no. At Pacific Bay Vistas, as we highlighted I think 2 quarters ago, after we completed the first couple of buildings we saw an opportunity to improve our design to deal with the moisture intrusion. As you know that's a very moist microclimate. And so we went back, redesigned it, tested it and we're now back in full swing. But the effect of it was a time delay which added to our cost and a certain addition in terms of the capital cost of the construction. I wouldn't expect that to be revenue enhancing and the impact on that particular property will be to reduce it's free cash flow internal rate of return from well over 10% to something closer to 10%.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","That's helpful. And then, Terry, on the purchase in San Diego, I'd like to touch on that. We're still looking for a little bit more in terms of parameters around what you look for when you're out there in the acquisition markets. So on that one, can you disclose the cap rate and talk about the process behind identifying that asset and how that asset might give us an indication of what you'll be looking for when you do make select an acquisition going forward?","Terry Considine","Well, I think, David, just as you know, but to review. We look at all of our capital allocation activities based on a free cash flow internal rate of return. By free cash flow, we mean after capital replacement spending and we use a standard charge of $1,200 a door across all of our investment activities. And we look at that whether we're making disposition, an acquisition or development. And in terms of then where we buy, you can see that very clearly in our indicated portfolio allocations, as reported in our documents. We have identified markets where we would like to have greater allocations and markets where we'd like to have lower allocations. And within those markets, we have identified preferred submarkets, where we'd like to own better located properties and sell weaker submarkets. So La Jolla is actually a wonderful example of what we're trying to do. La Jolla is one of the most desirable addresses in the entire country. Prospect 400 is one of the best located properties in La Jolla. It is, as real estate people would say, very good dirt. It's a small property, extremely well located and has great redevelopment potential.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on that asset, you mentioned in your press release the plans for significant capital upgrades. Can you talk about that and what that could result in, in terms of your going in cap rate and a stabilized yield?","Terry Considine","It would be premature to talk about the property upgrades we've disclosed in the last few weeks. But what you can expect is that we'll go through exactly the same discipline we've talked about on other cases. We'll look at where -- what, who's our target customer, what they would like to see in the property, what the opportunities and costs are of meeting their needs, and how much rent they would pay in return. What I would say about this location is, this is one of the most expensive housing locations in the country. They contiguous in quite similar condominiums priced in $1 million to $3 million range. And the upside in rents could be quite high.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicholas Joseph at Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was the $0.03 benefit from the repayment of the note receivable you received in the first quarter originally in full year guidance?","Ernest M. Freedman","Dave, this is Ernie Freedman. It was not in our full year guidance. It's above and beyond what we expected, both for our nonrecurring revenues and in our total numbers for FFO and AFFO that we provided last quarter.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the guidance raised by $0.02 really is more of a reflection of this?","Ernest M. Freedman","Exactly that. The benefit we got was slightly less than $0.03. We raised guidance $0.0.2 and I'm keeping a little in my pocket just to be a little conservative early in the year, that's exactly what it is.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then could you talk about, I guess, going back to Dave's question, can you talk about the acquisition pipeline today?","Terry Considine","Nick, this is Terry. I wouldn't say that we have a -- that we would expect to make a large number of acquisitions. We've been quite disciplined about them. And we've made, I think, we made 3 last year and we made 1 so far this year. I would not expect to see a high volume of acquisitions but we regularly look at what's available in the market and we look for anomalies where for some circumstance of taxes or debt structure or other. We think we can make an acquisition that will further our announced portfolio management goals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson at Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","You've been pretty clear in terms of the dispositions on the Affordable portfolio, the expectations there. Can you talk little bit about the 12,000, the roughly 12,000 units that you have in the other category within the Conventional portfolio? What the sort of plan is for those and sort of timing? Is this basically stuff that you would sell to offset acquisitions? Is this stuff that likely to be teed up after you get done with the Affordable? Can you just talk a little bit about that?","Terry Considine","Rob, that's exactly right. That's all inside our very explicit laid out portfolio management plan that we look at all of our properties, as I said before, based on a free cash flow internal rate of return. And we look both for -- in making any trade, we think of it as a pair trade that we're going to sell one or the other properties in order to buy something that we like better, as we said in La Jolla. And that we would be looking both for higher rates of return as measured by a free cash flow internal rate of return, as well as qualitative improvements as measured by price point.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. But the 300 to 350 of disposition guidance for this year is primarily Affordable, is that correct? Or some of that includes expectations of some Conventional?","Ernest M. Freedman","It's the latter, Rob. We expect about half of our disposition proceeds this year to come from those Affordable sales and about half would come from the Conventional sales. So Conventional sales are expected to happen in the late third quarter throughout the fourth quarter. We have a number of properties that we put into the market on the Conventional side in the last few weeks, and we'll see what the better takes are and we will see some Conventionals close before the end of the year.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then I'll ask the obligatory D.C. market question. You talked a little bit about how you're seeing performance vary across the various submarkets that you guys operate in D.C. and whether or not there's any difference price point-wise et cetera as well?","Keith M. Kimmel","Rob, this is Keith. Listen, D.C. is a market that we're very focused on as well. Occupancy was strong at 95.8% in the first quarter. We've seen a little moderation, but we really believe that our product being outside the Beltway and at a B price point, will have less impact than maybe some others will with the new product coming in, in downtown. With that said, we'll be cautious and we're very focused on keeping a close eye on it.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Is there any difference performance-wise between sort Maryland suburbs versus the Northern Virginia suburbs?","Keith M. Kimmel","There's a little bit but not a whole lot. It's really been pretty close. Alexander is a little bit further down than some of the others as an example outside Maryland and Fairfax.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ernie, on your comments about the changes in the same-store portfolio for the Affordable portfolio. Based upon the changes, what are you guys expecting from that portfolio maybe in terms of same-store revenue growth and NOI growth there in terms of contribution to earnings for 2013?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Specific to Affordable same store, which is now the 48 properties that we'll be holding longer term. Mike, we expect the revenue growth probably in the 2 range and expense growth very similar to  what we expect on the Conventional side. So overall NOI growth there is going to be flattish to maybe up 1 point in that small portfolio, which represents today about 5% or so of our total contribution for NOI.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And second of all, Keith, can you go through kind of how the As versus Bs versus Cs performed across the portfolio? And if you could see a unique way to look at it just given the -- is that the same operator across all 3 portfolios?","Keith M. Kimmel","Sure, Michael. We really look at new lease prices as the best parameter -- barometer, excuse me, as we really think about how they're performing. One thing though we've noticed, this particular quarter is, we've seen over previous quarters about 150 basis points spread between the As, Bs and Cs, it's tightened up to about 100 basis points. What I would tell you though is we have really seen some variability in marketplace, so depending on where the assets are located throughout the country that we can see some variants.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And when you just think about redevelopment conditions in the back half the year. Any plans for additional starts at this point or is just pretty much working through the stuff you have right now?","Ernest M. Freedman","Mike, this is Ernie. It's pretty much working through the stuff we have right now. We do have a couple of our larger multi-phased projects we've talked about and there will probably be spending on those that hasn't start as of yet. We're focused on our capital replacement spending. We're in the throes of planning for the next class. We think we have a pretty deep pipeline of opportunities in the future years. But most of the focus on redevelopment this year within our $130 million to $160 million guidance is on those projects that we have ongoing currently.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bob Horne (sic) [Buck Horne] at Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It's Buck. Do you have quick -- I'm sorry this is for Ernie. Do have an estimate of what the total nonrecurring revenues in the fourth quarter is going to be and what the FFO benefit would be, Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes. I do. And most of our nonrecurring revenues that we laid out on our initial guidance and what hit in the first quarter was not our initial guidance. It's going to hit in the fourth quarter, all but about $500,000 of that. Our guidance was $8 million to $12 million, of which would lead to an FFO impact, Buck, of about $0.05 because of the tax expense associated with some of that. So we would expect to see on the sequential basis a $0.05 increase, roughly, at the midpoint of that range from third quarter to fourth quarter from that activity. And then we'll have a nice bump up in the fourth quarter from third quarter as well because of our strong sequential growth in NOI because of what happens with both revenues expenses between third and fourth quarter.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. That's really helpful. Terry, just maybe more broadly. I'm thinking how would you characterize the industry's supply picture right now just more broadly. And do you think there are developers that are still stretching rent growth assumptions or construction cost estimate to get out of the ground or is it -- do you think it's going to get more disciplined? What are your thoughts around that? And I guess related to Aimco, is the spread between developing an asset versus an acquisition now attractive enough that anything -- any new projects might catch your eye?","Terry Considine","Mike, the general point would be that, as you know from having followed us for many years, developers will build when they can make a project pencil. And I they can get a lender to finance it. And so each -- every market in the country will be built to over supply at some point. The reason for diversification, of course, is that they won't all be overbuilt at the same time. And it'll just depend on the individual markets. The markets, for example, in Washington, D.C. today, we had a question about it just a minute ago, it's going to be harder to get a construction loan than it would be in West Los Angeles, where the supplier response and rent growth have been slower since the recession. But broadly, I would expect every market to respond to price increases and increased new supply to offset those rental rates. And i think that -- I'm trying to think the rest of your question was...","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Well, do you think -- is there anything that's attractive enough that Aimco would want to increase its exposure to new development projects out there?","Terry Considine","We would do so cautious. We look at that. We've done it from time-to-time. You will remember we did it quite successfully with the Palazzos for example, a decade ago. And I would think that it's something that we would look. We would look at it where it served our announced portfolio management plans of trying to upgrade the location in a particular submarket.","Operator","Our next question comes Hendel St. Just [ph] at Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Analyst","First one for Keith. What are the average turn costs both in dollars and vacancy lost in the portfolio? And how aggressive do you think our plan to be in pushing the rents going forward on your tenant base today given the recent portfolio changes? And how sensitive to turnover are you as you pushed the rents?","Keith M. Kimmel","Well, we always sold to total revenues. So it's certainly -- part of our contemplation is, is that rental rates, occupancy, turn costs and all those things are things that we consider. On average, our turn costs are around $300. And so it's certainly something that we're conscientious of and keep a close eye on.","Unknown Analyst","And the vacancy loss portion of that, how long does it typically take?","Keith M. Kimmel","It varies from market to market. But generally, around 21 days from move out to move in.","Ernest M. Freedman","Just to be clear that covers both the period of time it takes to ready the apartment, which for us is typically about 6 to 7 days. And then from there, just rent it up once it's been completed which will run about 14 days, as Keith mentioned, to get that total.","Unknown Analyst","Understood. All right. Second one for you, Terry. The portfolio of balancing improvements over the last 2 year's have been key to narrowing your relative discount to the peers. But a fairly wide discount still persists. Are you surprised by this and what are your thoughts, your plans going forward on narrowing that remaining discount to the peer group?","Terry Considine","Well, Hendel, I think you're exactly right. Theres a substantial discount today and of course, on the one hand that's a disappointment to me and then on the other hand, it's a great opportunity for those listening to this call. Aimco plans to narrow that gap by just systematically executing a very clear plan. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're increasing property operating results and I think we're increasing our revenue year-over-year at a significant cliff, and I think that will continue and that will meet our guidance, which had wonderful success at cost control. Costs are actually down at a compounded rate of 1.5% or 1.75% a year for the last 5 years. We're increasing our average rents 20% in the last 3 years by selling off the bottom and investing selectively in these higher-quality assets. Our redevelopment program is producing double-digit internal rates of return. Our balance sheet, we've given guidance today that will have a leverage ratio in the mid-6s by the end of next year. And the financial statements have a high quality of earnings and a certain simplicity and transparency. I think as the Street looks at that, I think they'll find it attractive and I think that will close that gap.","Unknown Analyst","Appreciate the response, but in fairness to them, I mean, you've been pretty clear in the past few quarters, maybe even few years on this plan. Is there something here you feel that perhaps the Street isn't getting, not appreciating or perhaps are there additional considerations that you think about your current plan that you would consider that, I guess, aren't being currently articulated?","Terry Considine","No. I think it's just a question of staying with it. We've had wonderful stock returns in the period of time you've mentioned.  What causes the discount is our net asset value keeps going up even faster. And so and that's a nice problem to have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz at Deutsche Bank.","Jeremy Metz","Ernie, just thinking about -- you gave a pretty good -- you laid out the run rate here for earnings as we look throughout the year, and then with the nonrecurring revenue coming in that fourth quarter. And I'm just trying to wrap my arms on it, the bulk of the sale should all really hit late 3Q, 4Q. Shouldn't a good amount of that $0.05 of upside be offset of at that point?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, Jeremy, that's a good question. But I think the timing of those sales and when they're going to happen is going to be pretty minimal dilution to the FFO line. And importantly, very little with no dilution to the AFFO line. As we do sell assets, there are -- sometimes there's a lag, Jeremy, in terms of our ability to adjust our off-site costs associated with that. We've seen that as we've done sales at the impacts on the short term to FFO could be there a little bit. Over the longer term, that goes away and then AFFO ends up being actually slightly accretive to us because we eliminate some of that capital replacement spending. So we do think that a lot of the sales happening at the back half of the year, specifically towards the end of the third quarter and the majority actually in the fourth quarter, and that's why these nonrecurring income items will happen then. Then there won't be too much of an impact or dilution from those sales in 2013, there'll be some in 2014.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just have you seen anything in terms of pricing and what you have on the market given the acquisitions you're looking at any noticeable change or increase in competition or movement in cap rates?","Terry Considine","The market -- this is Terry. The market today is roughly consistent with what it's been over the last year or so. But if anything, it's slightly better than it was 6 months ago.","Jeremy Metz","And is that in terms of both where pricing is coming in and the comp level of competition you're seeing?","Terry Considine","Both, yes. The one leads to the other.","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you very much. And what I'd like say is we appreciate your interest in Aimco. And here we're on plan, on track and optimistic about the balance of this year. So please call Elizabeth Coalson or Ernie Freedman or me with any questions. And we look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT Meeting in Chicago in another month or so. Thanks very much.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2016 and 2017 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations, John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, CFO. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa. And good morning to all of you on this call. I appreciate your interest in Aimco. The Aimco headline is this: business remains good and on track. We expect to meet or beat our guidance for the full year -- guidance which Paul has already raised twice.","Before turning to the details of the third quarter, I\u2019d like to take a minute to discuss the bigger picture. Of course, there's always turbulence in the markets and there are certainly some today. In some submarkets there's so much new supply at A price points that it cannot be easily absorbed leaving property owners to discount rents to gain occupancy. This is painful for those property owners and their neighbors if they are A price point competitors. It is also predictable.","Aimco portfolio strategy is designed for just such times. We emphasize price points and geographic diversification. We allocate half of our capital to be in C price points which are less affected by new supply. We emphasize lower turnover and higher renewal rates reducing the need to discount rents to attract new customers. And we invest across many submarkets, each with a somewhat different building cycle.","The best strategy is no better than its execution. As Keith will report in a few minutes, the Aimco team continues to do a good job in executing its plan. Here is one example. Paul told you at the start of this year that we were focused on the lease-up of vacant properties, some then still under construction. Paul also told you that we would be very transparent to investors as to our progress. ","Here's the update. We began the year with about 1300 units of lease-up exposure. We sit today with fewer than 500 of these units remaining and we expect to finish the year with about 150 of such units, an almost 90% reduction. Before adding about 300 units this year in additional phases at The Sterling and Park Towne Place based on the continuing success of those redevelopments.","At Indigo and One Canal, the pace of leasing is ahead of our underwriting by six to nine months. The successful lease-ups across the country are due to disciplined capital allocation by John and his team as well as excellent work by Keith and his leasing teams in Boston, Cambridge, Philadelphia and Redwood City.","We're now busy with plans and budgets for next year. Paul will provide detailed guidance for 2017 and the forecast for 2018 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Until then here's what I see. We plan to stick to our same strategy emphasizing customer satisfaction and cost control in operations, lower risk in accretive redevelopments, disciplined capital allocation based on paired trades, a safe balance sheet with non-recourse long dated property debt and limited exposure to capital markets, plus an intentional team culture emphasizing collaboration and performance.","The 2017 forecast that Paul made earlier this year seems likely to be roughly right. Property operations will generally be similar to that forecast. Contributions from lease-ups will be greater based on the good work done this year that I just mentioned. And interest expense savings from refinancing will also be greater as rates are lower than was forecasted. Broadly I expect 2017 results to be in the same range as they have been for the last four or five years.","For this good results and for the optimism and confidence that I feel about next year and beyond, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco team mates here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. ","And now for a more detailed report on third quarter operations, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, head of property operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid quarter in operations. Revenues were up 5% year over year. Expenses were up 2.4% with net operating income up 6.3% for this quarter. The rate of growth in both revenue and net operating income accelerated versus the third quarter of 2015.","As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.1% in the third quarter. Our residents gave us our 12th consecutive quarter of better than a four star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 5.3%, our sixth consecutive quarter of 5% renewal growth or better. ","There were no significant differences in renewal rents between our A and B communities in similar markets. We saw particular strength in Seattle, Boston, Atlanta, and Denver. Renewal rents in these markets increased between 7% and better than 8% compared to the expiring leases.","Our same-store portfolio saw our new lease rates increased by 3% led by our B communities with rate increases north of 4%, outperforming our As by 270 basis points. We saw a particular new lease strength in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and Denver with increases between 6% and 16%.","Shifting to resident turnover and quality. Turnover for the quarter was 47.2% in line with our third quarter of 2015. Of the customers who decided to move out, 27% were for career moves, 18% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long term averages. ","Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was 156,000, with a median income of 100,000. Year over year the median income of our new residents was up 5% compared to the third quarter of 2015.","Turning to revenue growth. Our 12 target markets were up 5.3% for the quarter versus 5% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from about 8% to better than 15%. This was led by Seattle, followed by Boston, San Diego and Denver. Our strong performers which had revenue growth from almost 5% to 7% were the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Our steady markets with more than 3% to 4% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia.","Of note, our Washington D.C. portfolio neared 4% in revenue growth for the quarter, signaling its recovery from a lengthy period of operating in an oversupplied market. And finally finishing up by more than 2% we had New York City and Miami.","As we enter our peak leasing season, we\u2019ve made a strategic decision to build occupancy heading into 2017. This decision resulted increasing October's average daily occupancy by 50 basis points to 95.9%. While not yet complete, preliminary October lease rates had blended lease rates up about 2%, renewals up 5% and new leases roughly flat. In November and December renewal offers went out with 4% to 7% increases.","With great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco success, I will turn the call over to John Bezzant, our chief investment officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. During the third quarter our investment activities were focused on continued upgrades to our portfolio through redevelopment. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of Indigo in Redwood City, California.","I am pleased report that we made significant progress on our lease-ups at both Indigo and One Canal in Boston. We invested $44 million in our redevelopment activities, $16 million in the continuation of projects we were executing in phases, $10 million in new starts and the balance in several smaller projects in planning within our redevelopment pipeline.","Our phased redevelopment projects include Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center City, Philadelphia and the Palazzo in Los Angeles. At Park Towne Place we are working our way through the four residential towers with construction completed in the South Tower and nearly complete in the East Tower. Earlier this month we began construction on the North Tower. As of September 30, we completed approximately 60% of the total apartment homes approved for redevelopment. And of those completed homes, 76% were leased. The rental rate achievement across the redeveloped buildings is in line with underwriting.","We also continue the final phase of our redevelopment at Sterling where 91% of the completed apartment homes are leased and the rents are consistent with underwriting. During the quarter we started new projects at Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California; and Yorktown in suburban Chicago. Detail on these projects is included in schedule 10. ","As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter we closed the acquisition of Indigo. Our lease-up of this community began earlier this year while it was still under construction with the first occupancies on July 1. At acquisition in August, the community was 27% leased. As of today Indigo is over 63% leased. Lease pace is well ahead of our underwriting and rents are in line with underwriting.","At One Canal where we received our final certificate of occupancy this month, we have seen an outstanding lease up as well. Currently over 81% of the apartment homes are leased at rents above underwriting. ","I'd like to take a moment to thank our teams at both One Canal and Indigo for their stellar efforts and success during third quarter. As a result of their good work, we find ourselves well ahead of plan and well positioned for the fourth quarter and the successful 2017 at both properties. ","As to sales, we sold one affordable community during the third quarter and anticipate the closing of over $200 million of additional sales in the fourth quarter to complete the year on plan. ","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thank you, John. Beginning with third quarter 2016 results, at $0.45 per share AFFO was at the midpoint of our guidance range and pro forma FFO of $0.55 per share was one penny above the midpoint of our range. The drivers of pro forma FFO outperformance was better than expected property operations and lower interest expense as we take advantage of the low interest rate environment. ","Now turning to the balance sheet. As previously announced in July, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 7% Class Z preferred stock at a redemption value of approximately $35 million. In doing so we incurred $1.9 million redemption related charges. These charges were excluded from the calculation of pro forma FFO. We also prepaid at par $168 million of property debt with a weighted average interest rate 5.67%. ","And in September we closed on a $145 million same year fixed rate non-recourse loan at a 3.34% interest rate which represented a spread of 152 basis points above the 10-year treasury rates. At the end of the third quarter we had outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $295 million. We expect to repay the line borrowings with proceeds from fourth quarter property sales and a new 10-year fixed rate non-recourse loan of approximately $150 million. The spread on this loan has been locked at 140 basis points above the 10-year treasury. At year end we expect no significant line borrowings and that our trailing twelve months leverage to EBITDA ratio to be 6.7 times, consistent with our beginning of year guidance. ","We expect a further decline in leverage in 2017. On a run rate basis we are forecasting fourth quarter 2017 leverage to EBITDA of approximately 6.0 times driven by the completion of the Indigo and One Canal lease-ups as well as earnings from our redevelopment activities. ","Looking forward to the remainder of the year we are increasing the midpoint of our full year 2016 pro forma FFO guidance by one penny to reflect the third quarter outperformance and are maintaining the midpoint of our AFFO guidance to reflect additional capital spending to maintain our properties. ","In yesterday\u2019s release, we also established fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance of $0.58 to $0.62 per share and AFFO guidance of $0.50 to $0.54 per share. In the same store operations with overall third quarter results in line with our expectations, we narrowed our full year guidance for our same store revenue, expense and NOI growth. The midpoints of each range remain unchanged. ","For the year we expect revenue growth of 4.7% to 4.8%, expense growth of 1.8% to 2.2% resulting in an NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.25%. For the fourth quarter we project same store NOI growth of 5.75% to 6.75% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.","We will provide full 2017 guidance as part of our fourth quarter earnings call once we've completed our budget process. However as a preview, we expect 2017 property operations to look a lot like the forecast that we published at the beginning of this year.","While some markets have softened, potentially reducing rent growth, we see opportunities to outperform by improving occupancy and controlling costs. And we currently expect that our 2017 NOI growth will fall within the forecast range of 4% to 5.5%. I look forward to sharing the details of the guidance with you in February. ","Before we take questions, I\u2019d like to point out a change that we made to our supplemental schedules. As many of you know the Securities and Exchange Commission recently publicly clarified their position regarding the presentation of proportion of financial information. In response we revised the presentation of supplemental schedules 2, 3 and 4 and we provided a detailed explanation of the revisions on page 10 of our earnings release package. ","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions two per time in a queue. Laura I\u2019ll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. ","Austin Wurschmidt ","Hi, good morning. It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Terry, you mentioned that the property operations were trending pretty much in line with your 2017 forecast. So just curious on the nonrecurring items, where you are in terms of the wind down from the affordable and asset management business.","Terry Considine","Austin, that's a good question but I am going to turn that to Paul because he is the master of those details. ","Paul Beldin","Yes, Austin, thank you for the question. On the wind down of the affordable asset management business, there's really two components to that. The first relates to the amortization of our deferred tax credit income and that in our outlook that we've prepared for 2017 you will have noted that that drops from \u201915 to \u201916 and then \u201916 to \u201917 by roughly $5 million or $6 million each year. We continue to expect that decline as well. ","The other component of the wind down relates to the operations of the properties themselves. And so over the course of the next few years John and the team will work hard to sell those properties as they end their compliance periods and enter kind of the remaining five year period under which we have to maintain compliance with the programs but do have the ability to sell. John, would you add anything to that? Does that respond to your question?","Austin Wurschmidt ","Initially I think you guys said at the beginning of the year $0.09 to $0.10 of dilution next year from the wind down. I'm just curious if that's still intact or if that's accelerated at any point.","Paul Beldin","It's still intact, Austin, I think for the total non core earnings bucket which is comprised of the deferred tax credit income, nonrecurring management revenues, historic tax credits and then just our other tax benefits or expense that $0.09 to $0.10 range is still intact.","Austin Wurschmidt ","Thank you. And then switching over just on the investment side, I mean with Indigo and One Canal, you've talked about those leasing up well ahead of your expectations. I was just curious if you're evaluating any other development or lease-up type investment opportunities as you look across the portfolio and look to meet any other portfolio management objectives.","John Bezzant","Austin, this is John. We look at opportunities regularly and kind of always have our toe in the market within our target markets to see what's out there. But right now we don\u2019t have anything on the immediate horizon. ","Operator","And the next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nick Joseph ","Thanks. It's been a year since you announced the Indigo acquisition. I appreciate the update on the occupancy, the leasing, and the rents. What are your current expectations for the stabilized yield and how has that changed since initial underwriting?","John Bezzant","Nick, it\u2019s right on track with the initial underwriting. We would look at a yield there that would be kind of high fives when we get fully\u2013 excuse me \u2013 high 9s, low 5s, -- high 9s, 5, 4s, low 5s as we stabilize out the next couple of years. ","Paul Beldin","Yeah when we announced the acquisition last year in the third quarter we had discussed a stabilized NOI yield of 4.9%. And we're on track to hit that number. ","Nick Joseph ","What year is that stabilization?","Paul Beldin","It's upon NOI stabilization, so once you complete the lease up, and you have a full year of lease terms, so we\u2019re about say 18 months or so out from that now. ","Nick Joseph ","And then, Terry, you've talked about and talked about at the beginning of this call how different markets and sub-markets will be over built at different points in the cycle. We've obviously been focused on Northern California, New York, Houston. But looking ahead, I guess, over the next 12 to 24 months, which of your markets are you watching or would most concern you that maybe we aren't focused on today?","Terry Considine","Well, Nick, that's a good question. And what I would say at the beginning is that we really have to think about it at a very specific market level so it's not just the Bay Area, of the Ren County will behave very differently from Peninsula, San Jose and from Fremont. But for the specific markets I am going to ask Paul Beldin to speak. ","Paul Beldin","Nick, we have put together an analysis in the third quarter that looked at the expected number of deliveries between the third quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017 and we looked at it at the submarket level and because it's important to note that sometimes supply in a couple of submarkets down the road will have little or no impact on a community where there's no direct competition. And it's also important to remember the impact of the price points and so as we look at this the potential impact of supply we bifurcated in a number of ways, we looked at our JV that was not exposed to any new supply, that\u2019s about 13%. Then the next cut off was a 1% from the new supply, we have about another 19% of our GAV that falls into that bucket. We have about 23% of our GAV that has new supply, more than 1% but less than 2% and the reason that 2% threshold is important is because we typically see markets operating fairly efficiently at sub 2% supply level. And that would then leave about 38% of our GAV where you have supply greater than 2%. And to bifurcate that down then to the price point diversification point, we have about 16% of our total GAV, so that\u2019s a B or C plus price point. So a lesser effect on the new supply there. And that leaves about 22% of A price point communities that will incur new supply greater than 2%. And I would note that of that 22%, roughly 1% of that is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. So the inverse of that, of that math is that we have about 79% of our GAV that we don't expect to be meaningfully impacted by the new supply. ","Now then to actually answer the question you asked, I would say that for Aimco\u2019s portfolio where we see exposure at that A price point, we see it most notably in the downtown South Beach area of Miami, at our Flamingo, Baypark and Yacht Club communities and then also at in Center City, Philadelphia. Although I would note that a portion of that new supply, the supply that we will be delivering the course of the next nine months or so.","Operator","And next we have a question from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico ","Thanks. Paul, just going back to your comment about the 2017 forecast for same-store NOI being, I think you said the same as the original outlook given earlier this year. Is your confidence in that driven by the fact that you guys got lower expense growth this year? Earlier this year, you reduced your expense growth forecast. Is that what's driving more of the comfort level versus revenue, maybe the revenue growth expectation?","Paul Beldin","Yes, Nick, our comfort level in our NOI range that we provided for \u201917 between 4% and 5.5% is driven as much as anything as opportunities that we see within our own portfolio. We continually focus on ways to be more effective onsite, to spend more efficiently and we have a couple of ideas that are teed up that we're discussing as we go through the budget process. We also think revenue growth for 2016 has performed largely in line with our expectations, so we think that our jump up point for next year will be fairly similar to what we expected at the beginning of the year and we also think the -- that renewal lease rates will be largely consistent with our model that we model a 4.5% which leaves the variable on new lease rates. And as we look at the third party projections for new lease rates for next year at the sub market level we\u2019re seeing a decline -- a very slight decline. And so based upon all the data we have now we think that the range that we provided is so likely to be achieved.","Nick Yulico ","That's helpful. Terry, can you talk a little bit about your appetite to do acquisitions? Do you feel you need to still upgrade the quality of the portfolio in terms of newer -- adding more newer buildings or do you like having the heavier Class B mix as we are getting a little bit later in the apartment cycle?","Terry Considine","Nick, we're quite pleased with our current portfolio allocation but not at all satisfied. We\u2019re always interested in trying to make it better and in looking at our portfolio the first thing that we think about probably would not be price points but would be the quality of locations. And so the opportunity to buy particularly in locations for example such as La Jolla and Marin county would always be of interest to us. ","In terms of price point, we like the mix between A and B and our interest in an acquisition would most likely be at a B price point. But again opportunities emerge unexpectedly and Indigo is an example of that where we bought an A asset on an opportunistic basis that I think would be highly accretive So we have that philosophy as we look at the market, we're not deal junkies. We haven't made a new commitment to acquire property in 18 months and we've typically averaged three or four year over the last five or so years, so it's something that we look at quite actively. But I don't expect to see tons of activity. ","Operator","And our next question will come from Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Rob Stevenson ","Good afternoon, guys. Paul, I guess just an ancillary question based off of, it looks like that this is the first quarter that you guys have ever had a preponderance of Class A units in the portfolio. I think it's now up to 51% on one of your schedules. What does that sort of do to you guys in terms of the replacement, capital replacements or the AFFO non-revenue maintenance adjustment going forward? Are you looking at 2017 and beyond with a newer portfolio than you've had in the past at a significantly lower annual per-unit cost on that? How should we be thinking about that?","Terry Considine","Rob, this is Terry and I would like to take and answer that, then ask Paul to comment. Broadly owning newer assets does not reduce the rate of depreciation. It may reduce the rate of cash costs but one of the deficiencies of the FFO measure is it doesn't acknowledge the continuing depreciation which is quite similar between A and B. And so the more likely outcome is that over time we will increase the $1200 reflecting monetary inflation.","Rob Stevenson ","Okay. And then I guess back to the expense question, Paul, you guys have been trending at a 2% same-store expense growth. You guys have been really handling taxes I think better than most of the peers at only up 3.5% year to date, and even on your on-site payroll where a lot of your peers are bemoaning the fact that it's sort of spiraling upward, for you guys it's only been up a little less than 4% year to date. How confident are you at being able to keep expenses down in the 2%, maybe in the 2.5% range going forward? Or is there any sort of give-back where you have difficult year-over-year comps and we're likely to see expense growth jump into the 3s or higher?","Paul Beldin","As we look at expense growth for 2017, Keith and I actually had the opportunity to review the first cut of the budget about a week ago. And what struck me as we went through the discussion on the number of innovative ideas where we think we have the opportunity to be more efficient with our labor, more efficient with our spending, with contract maintenance and with turns and because of that level of detail that we undertake as part of the budget and planning process, I have a great deal of confidence for next year that our same store expenses, while they may not be the 2% that we've guided to this year, they will likely below -- be below the 3% which was the high end of our range that we provided for \u201817. ","Operator","And the next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim ","Thank you. At Indigo, by recollection, you have a high percentage of Facebook employees there. Can you just provide an update on that? And also, many of those employees are subsidized by the company to be near campus. Is it your understanding that's an annual incentive or more of a one-time incentive?","John Bezzant","John, John here, I'll take first crack at it. In terms of number in a building, it\u2019s about 15% today and as to the incentive, we have \u2013 on the operating side the incentive package for them as a preferred provider, I will let Keith speak to.","Keith Kimmel","John, I just want to clarify your question. I think you were asking Facebook have an incentive to fund their team members to live in our building, is that -- was that the question?","John Kim ","Yes, either at your building or close to headquarters.","Keith Kimmel","And what we have done is the numbers that John is talking to are these are individual leases with individual team members that work at Facebook. And so this has not been a Facebook funded population of residents that live in our communities, these are actually individual Facebook team members who said because of proximity to the campus and only being nine miles away and close proximity to the train and our particular location they have chosen us over many of the other places in which they've had some of those kind of contract deals.","John Kim ","And then Paul, I think in your preview for 2017, you mentioned that there are potentially markets where you can gain occupancy. Can you just elaborate on that statement?","Paul Beldin","Actually I\u2019ll let Keith Kimmel talk about maybe some broad general market expectations for \u201917 particularly related occupancy growth. ","Keith Kimmel","John, can you just clarify the question for me, real quick. You're asking what markets we think occupancy will change year over year or what was it specifically?","John Kim ","I think there was a commentary on \u201817, even though the conditions have gotten tougher in some markets that you would be able to make up for that in expense reduction and occupancy gains. I'm not sure -- ","Keith Kimmel","So yeah, let me \u2013 I will walk you through that John. Really where we see the opportunity is when we think about the time from when a resident moves to the time that a resident -- a new resident will move back in, it\u2019s really bifurcated in two pieces. One being, the first one which is current time, how long it takes to turn the apartment. The second piece as we describe it is vacancy after a turn or short term of that and what we do is we believe there's an opportunity to improve that position over the next year because of our focus on efficiencies and a variety of other models that we think that we can pick up a day or two or maybe even more than that in condensing that time period.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Michael Kodesch of Canaccord. ","Michael Kodesch ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered, but just two more from me. The first one is as it relates to 4Q guidance, just looking at some of your lease trends from July through September and even October, we're starting to see a deceleration. You guys did 6.3% NOI growth in 3Q, and your midpoint, I guess, for 4Q is close to that. Can you just kind of help us get more comfortable with how you see trends continuing through 2016 to hit that NOI guidance number and where you expect to see improvement? Thanks.","Paul Beldin","Michael, really the secret at this point in the year to achieving revenue growth guidance for us or just revenue growth period comes down to the occupancy levels. And so at this point on a real rough rough math if we enter into a lease that\u2019s up or down by 100 basis points, the impact on the remainder of the year is maybe $100,000 or so. So where were you see the real benefit is growing occupancy and where we are planning currently we see the opportunity to grow occupancy by say 30 to 40 basis points. Keith noted in his remarks that we\u2019re up 50 basis points in October and we actually have fewer lease expirations year over year in November and December than what we had year over year in October. So we feel like we\u2019re well set up to achieve that occupancy gain.","Michael Kodesch ","Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just as it relates to 2017 dispositions, I believe your initial outlook called for about $200 million dispositions at the midpoint. Do you guys still expect to achieve that in 2017 or just with some of the affordable portfolio winding down or is that still the expectation?","Paul Beldin","Michael, we actually expect for our dispositions likely to come down from that $175 million to $225 million range that we provided and part of that is due to the fact that we have accelerated some of those planned sales in \u201917 into \u201916. And so our sales in the fourth quarter here will pre-fund say roughly $50 million of our cash needs for 2017.","End of Q&A","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session.

Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2019 and 2020 expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can we found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may we discussed today. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Amico's website. ","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, Executive Vice President, in charge of Redevelopment; and Paul Beldin, our CFO. John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer, is present and will be available during our question-and-answer session, which will follow our prepared remarks. ","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Two or three headlines. First, Paul raises guidance again. The explanation is another great quarter of property operations. In a few minutes, Keith will have more tell you. Second, Patty and Paul capitalize on current interest rates to lower the cost of Aimco leverage. Paul expects the work of the past few quarters to save more than $20 million annually.","And third, John, Wes and Lisa continue to reallocate to reallocate Aimco capital, to value-add -- value-creating opportunities in higher-growth submarkets. Without stealing Wes' thunder, I am enthusiastic about our increased investment in Florida, in general, and in Miami, in particular. As most of you know, Florida is the third most popular state after California and Texas. Florida is 10% more populous than New York, and about equal to Pennsylvania and Illinois, added together. Its mild weather and cosmopolitan culture attract people from the Northeast and from around the world. An important part of its economic appeal is effective government with good education, modern infrastructure and low taxes. And did I mention, no state income tax. ","Miami, the largest of Florida's metropolitan areas is the leader among Atlantic seaboard cities, including such sunbelt darlings as Nashville, for the rate at which real GDP per capita has increased going back to 2013. And our locations include the best neighborhoods in all of Miami-Dade County. And other but related news Aimco was named by Bay Area News Group, a top workplace in the Bay Area, adding to our frequent recognitions including designation by the Denver Post as a top workplace in Colorado for the past 7 years. ","I offer sincere thanks to the entire Aimco team. You are the bedrock foundation of Aimco's success. If any of you on this call are interested to learn more about what makes Aimco special, please ask any Aimco teammate or read our corporate responsibility report available on our website. ","Now for a more detailed report on the second quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. As mentioned in our first headline, we had a strong second quarter in operations. The outlook for the balance of the year is also positive. We've continued to improve our occupancy while increasing rental rates. This starts with consistently high customer satisfaction and the relentless focus on customer selection. Our second quarter trailing 12-month turnover was 45.4%, marking a sixth consecutive quarter under 46%. As a result, second quarter average daily occupancy was 96.9%, 60 basis points better than the second quarter of 2018. Our strong occupancy translated to solid top line growth, with revenues up 3.8% for the quarter. Our top markets with growth over 4% were Washington, D.C., Boston, the Bay Area, Philadelphia and Seattle. We had solid performances of growth over 2.5% in Los Angeles, San Diego, Denver, Chicago and Miami. Finally, markets with growth over 1% are New York and Atlanta, which make up less than 4% of our same-store revenue. ","Expenses in the second quarter grew 1.8%. We continued to drive innovation and productivity, resulting in lower personnel, marketing and administrative costs. This was offset by higher property taxes as well as increased maintenance expense as we continued to invest in our communities. As a result, net operating income grew 4.6% and margins expanded to 73.3%, 50 basis points better than last year. ","Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter. New lease rates were up 2%, renewal rates were up 5% and same-store blended lease rates were up 3.6%. Our strongest new lease rate growth was in Philadelphia, Boston and Seattle, with the most pressure on new lease rates in Chicago and New York.","Finally, as we look at our preliminary July results, we see a good start to the third quarter and an acceleration of our momentum. Blended lease rates are up 3.9%, with new lease rates up 2.6% and renewals up 4.8%, all while achieving average daily occupancy of 96.6%, some 50 basis points better than 2018. And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President of Redevelopment. Wes?","Wesley Powell","Thank you, Keith. Today, I will provide highlights on our second headline. Aimco continues to reallocate capital to value-creating opportunities in higher-growth submarkets. During the second quarter, we invested a total of $52 million in redevelopment and development across our portfolio. At Parc Mosaic in Boulder, a very wet winter and spring season slowed our pace of construction and led to higher costs. We now expect our total investment in Parc Mosaic to be $123 million. Our initial move-ins occurred yesterday, and demand has been strong. 80% of our first building was pre-leased at rents above underwriting prior to its delivery. We expect the higher rents to offset the higher costs, leaving our expected returns unchanged. ","Construction at our other ground-up projects in Elmhurst, Illinois and on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora remain on time and on budget. ","Turning to new business. Aimco began the next phase of redevelopment at Flamingo Point in Miami Beach, where we are completely renovating this waterfront community. As we previously announced, our first phase includes major improvements to the site and ground-level retail. These enhancements will be complete later this year. In the newly announced phase, we will fully reposition the property's North Tower, saving only its concrete structure and creating all-new floor plans, which highlight the spectacular views of Biscayne Bay. In addition, we will renovate apartment homes within Flamingo Point's Center Tower on the turn and only as demand warrants. Upon completion of the amenities, common areas, retail and apartments in the North and Center Towers, Aimco will have invested $280 million, generating a free cash flow IRR of approximately 10% on its incremental investment.","On the acquisition's front. Aimco purchased for $157 million in an off-market transaction, a 95% interest in a nearly 2-acre waterfront property located in Brickell and directly adjacent to our Yacht Club community. The property 1001 Brickell Bay Drive contains a 30-story office tower, with approximately 350,000 square feet of rentable space, which is currently 86% occupied. ","Our investment thesis is simple. Given the scarcity of waterfront land in Brickell, the substantial increase in densities that is allowed by code and the efficiencies gained through assemblage with our neighboring property there exists the potential to unlock considerable value through a large-scale redevelopment of the combined sites.","With no definitive plans to report today, we remain open to all possibilities to maximize value, including the potential of a joint venture partner. In the meantime, we intend to operate 1001 Brickell Bay Drive based on its existing use, generating a free cash flow IRR in the mid-8 percentage range, approximately 250 basis points higher than the returns expected from the apartment communities being sold to fund the acquisition. We expect this investment to be accretive to earnings in 2019, with an initial NOI yield in the mid- to upper 5s, growing as we increase occupancy to the submarket average. ","Also during the quarter, Aimco purchased an apartment building that is currently under construction in Cambridge and located directly across the street from our Axiom community. We expect our $70 million investment in this 136-unit property to generate a free cash flow IRR north of 9% and NOI yields near 6% at stabilization. Construction is scheduled to be complete approximately 1 year from now. ","Coupled with our Axiom and Vivo communities, which are located within a 2-block radius, Aimco will have $200 million invested in the heart of the thriving Kendall Square submarket. ","Finally, during the quarter, Aimco sold one property for $79 million in suburban Chicago, in keeping with our paired trade strategy whereby we recycle capital to value-creating opportunities in higher-growth submarkets. Additional sales are expected before year-end or in the first half of next year to complete the leverage-neutral paired trades plan to fund the acquisitions and redev spending I've just described.","And with thanks to all of my teammates for their continued hard work and pursuit of value-creating opportunities, both inside and outside of our portfolio, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, Wes. Our third headline is: Aimco capitalizes on current interest rates to lower its cost of leverage. Aimco leverage is primarily safe property debt, that is low-cost, long-dated amortizing and nonrecourse. We are not market timers. Yesterday reconfirms that interest rates are predictable. We're focused on regular repricing of our leverage when we can and do so at lower rates. In May, Aimco redeemed its Class A professional preferreds, retiring a $125 million at a 6.875% rate. ","In June, Aimco rate-locked $587 million of new fixed-rate property debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3.37%, a weighted average spread to the applicable benchmark treasury rates of 129 basis points and a weighted average term to maturity of 11.5 years. $284 million of these loans closed in July and the balance is expected to close in August. We're paying all bank borrowings so that Aimco's $800 million line of credit is undrawn and available, and with a pool of unencumbered properties valued at more than $2.3 billion. ","The new property loans extend the average duration of Amico's debt by more than 1\/2 year and reduce our weighted average cost of leverage by 10 basis points. When combined with the refinance activity completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, Aimco has reduced annual average leverage costs by approximately $20 million. ","Now turning to our financial results for the quarter and guidance. Second quarter AFFO per share of $0.51 and pro forma FFO per share of $0.60 were both $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance ranges due to strong performance at our same-store properties.","Based on these results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising guidance. Same-store guidance is raised for a second time this year at the midpoint and compared to our beginning of year guidance we have, improved our revenue growth rate by 40 basis points to 3.7%, improved our expense growth rate by 20 basis points to 2.3%, improved our NOI growth by 60 basis points to 4.2%. And as a result, we've increased our pro forma FFO and AFFO per share expectations by $0.02 at the midpoint.","I remind you, it was 1 year ago when Aimco sold its Asset Management business, accepting near-term earnings dilution as the price of a longer-term increased growth rate. In the first half of 2019, Aimco overcame the dilution, posting pro forma FFO per share of $1.21, up $0.01 from last year. Third quarter will be the last quarter when current results are compared to a bottom line inflated by contribution from the now-sold Asset Management business. ","Fourth quarter results will be the first where the increasing profitability of apartment operations will be apparent in year-over-year comparisons of the bottom line. Using the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter pro forma FFO guidance, we expect year-over-year growth to accelerate to approximately 5%. Finally, Aimco's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, up 3% over the quarterly dividend paid in 2018.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Rocco, I'll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","Paul, maybe starting with guidance. I appreciate the update. But if we look at the back half of the year in terms of same-store revenue growth, it looks like it's going to decelerate by about 60 basis points assuming the midpoint. Could you walk through these assumptions there in terms of occupancy, rate close and other revenue that get you to that midpoint?","Paul Beldin","You bet, Nick. Thanks for the question. It's really been driven by occupancy. As you likely all have noticed, in the first half of the year, we are able to -- well, Keith and the team were able to increase occupancy by 80 basis points. And so as we enter the second half of the year, we have a little bit of a tougher comp. We still expect that occupancy will likely be higher year-over-year in the second half but not to the same extent.","Nicholas Joseph","And just maybe on the balance sheet. Leverage is a little higher than the target, but it sounds like there is a plan to get it back down to target by year-end. So can you go through the path to getting leverage back to your longer-term target?","Paul Beldin","You bet, Nick. You're right that our thoughts on leverage are unchanged. As a reminder, we keep leverage-to-EBITDA ratio to be below 7x. And really, we're also seeking total leverage to be about $3.8 billion. As you point out, we are above these levels currently and do have a plan and anticipation to get back to those levels by year-end. And what we -- what drove the increased leverage now was we just wanted to take advantage of the ability to lock in low interest rates. But when we complete our paired trades that Lisa and team are working on in the remainder of the year, we'll be back at those leverage targets.","Operator","And our next question today comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","Piljung Kim","On the 1001 Brickell Drive office acquisition. Is your plan as you lease it up because you mentioned wanting to bring that to market, are you going to be leasing on a short-term basis to provide optionality to eventually redevelop? Or is this going to be long-term office hold?","Wesley Powell","John, it's Wes. I'll take that one. And the answer is, yes, we are considering lease duration as we lease that building up in primarily shorter-term leases, 4-year durations, but also including provisions and clauses that would allow us access to the building if and one redevelopment materialized. And I'd say that the existing in-place leases have an average duration of well less than 5 years.","Piljung Kim","And then sorry, it wasn't clear to me. Can you also develop on this land adjacent to the office building? Or is it really that development opportunity with the office redevelopment?","Wesley Powell","No. The office building today takes up the majority of the site, if that's the question.","Piljung Kim","Yes. Okay. Second question is on redevelopments. It looks like you're planning to spend $360,000 per unit, which is a bit higher than what you've done in past years. Can you just discuss why it seems initially high this time around and what kind of rental uplift you expect to chase?","Wesley Powell","Sure. And I assume you're referencing the Flamingo project on the $360,000?","Piljung Kim","Just the entire redevelopment actually.","Wesley Powell","Oh, on the entire redevelopment. Yes, I think right now in the entire pool, we're obviously weighted more towards ground-up developments. And also on the redev side at both our 707 Leahy project and specially the North Tower at the Flamingo. Those are very comprehensive projects that we'll essentially rebuild those properties back to new. So it's a heavier investment than typical, but relative to the rent increases and the value-add opportunity, we feel very good about it.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Trent Trujillo of Scotiabank.","Trent Trujillo","So in recent calls, you mentioned you'd have about $1 billion or so of assets on the mark any giving time, some of which for transaction, some of which for pricing discovery. And after you announced sales, that puts you at about $500 million or so based on valuation a few quarters ago. It looks like you added Hyde Park Tower and Willow Bend in Chicago to your list. Makes sense based on the comments -- prior comments about Chicago, but you also added California assets, The Bluffs at Pacifica. So could you talk about that decision? And also, overall, how much you estimate you have on the market today?","Lisa Cohn","This is Lisa Cohn. I'll take it and then I can turn it over to Terry or John to add to. We have about $700 million in the market, and you're right on about Chicago and we've expressed our views on what we see is potential for lackluster growth in that market as well as the politics of Illinois. And The Bluffs is a unique property that has had some opportunities as well as some potential challenges and we're always looking to think about the balance of our assets in California as well. Terry or John, anything?","Terry Considine","John?","Trent Trujillo","Okay. I guess one for Wes. I appreciate the comments on Parc Mosaic. So that development saw a 5% increase in investment, but the return profile is essentially unchanged. So I guess 2-part question here. I think you previously mentioned a 5.5% to 6% stabilized yield. So does the unchanged expectation mean you're expecting the low end, the midpoint or high end of that? And second part of that, has strength in rate growth had any effect on how you're underwriting other developments?","Wesley Powell","Take those in turn. On the yields, I would say, your range is correct, but it's very early days. We've experienced strong demand, rents are, let's say, a good amount above our original underwriting. And as we lease up the building through the remainder of the year, we'll let you know where we land. But that's still the range we're targeting. And then the second question was on other developments and the rent growth or can you repeat that one for me?","Trent Trujillo","Since basically, the strength in rate growth and rent growth at Parc Mosaic offset the increased in -- the increased investment, has that had any effect on how you're underwriting your other developments?","Wesley Powell","It is not. No.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. And I'm sorry, one more quick one, sorry, if I may? Keith, so you cited turnover has been favorable. And in the first quarter, it was down 150 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis year-over-year. But this quarter, it was actually up 40 basis points year-over-year. Can you talk about why that is? And where you see turnover trending in your portfolio?","Keith Kimmel","Trent, thanks for the question. You're correct, there was a slight increase in -- I would tell you we're always trying to be better. With that being said, the 45% that we had is consistent with our plan and most importantly was peer-leading as we look at it across the board. Turnover is really just one of many levers that we use as we solve to total revenue the [indiscernible] way to the expense and, of course, bottom line. We -- this was our sixth consecutive quarter at sub-46, and we think that we'll continue to see numbers like that and we will look to be better each quarter as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shirley Wu","So my first question has to do with renewal. So it would seem as if June and July have decelerated from a high of 5.3% in May. So I was just curious as to how you're approaching that lever versus occupancy? And how you see that playing out in the rest of pre-leasing season?","Keith Kimmel","Shirley, listen, renewals are something that we put a lot of focus and that's specifically around retaining our customers, and we think those that stay with us longer are more profitable. At the end of the day, we look at blended lease rates, both the combination of new and renew. And, of course, the third lever being occupancy. And so total revenue is how we solve it, and we don't solve it to any one particular thing, except for the fact that I would tell you that retention of our residents is one of the most important things we think we can to.","Shirley Wu","Okay. So moving on to your acquisition in Cambridge. So the acquisition was for $5 million. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's actually there, if that's just land for now and who the seller was? And why did he decide to sell out that development?","John Bezzant","Yes, Shirley. This is John. This development is very similar, in fact, exact same fracture to our Vivo building that we bought a few years ago there. You may be -- your name is new anyway to me to the coverage universe. But we bought a building there from Alexandria Real Estate Equities that they completed for us. We're repeating that process again, as Wes indicated, hiring 36 units across the street from existing building. The building is under construction. It gets steel up to the second floor, and we will pay the remaining cost through the completion of construction.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","So as we start to think about the start for the Flamingo Point deal and other redevelopment opportunities into 2020, projects like 88th Street and Second Avenue. How should we expect the level of development and redevelopment spend to trend really into 2020?","Wesley Powell","Austin, it's Wes. I'll start and if anyone, Terry, or others want to supplement, they can do so. I think as we roll into next year, the expectation is that we will be at, if not above, our level of investment in redevelopment. We've got a healthy pipeline. Of course, it's subject to timing of start, some of which are in our control and some are not. But, of course, as we get later in the year and start to put our plans together, we'll give you more precise information there.","Austin Wurschmidt","Appreciate the thoughts. I guess then piggybacking on that a little bit. Then how should we think about then the dispositions in funding of that potentially higher redevelopment spend next year?","Paul Beldin","Yes, Austin. This is Paul. I appreciate the question, but it starts to sound like we're starting to get dangerously close to providing 2020 guidance. So what I'll leave it at is that we intend to continue to execute all of our redevelopment and potential acquisition activity on a leverage-neutral paired-trade basis. And so to the extent that we spend $250 million, which is the midpoint of our expectations of this year or maybe a little more next year, we'll fund that with asset sales and leverage-neutral basis.","Austin Wurschmidt","Appreciate the thoughts. And then just last one from me. Expenses are up a modest 1.8% here to 4%. I guess, what's driving the implied increase in the back half of the year to over 3%? Or is there just a good bit of room in there for conservatism or for unexpected items?","Keith Kimmel","Austin, this is Keith. In the second half, your -- as you mentioned, we see -- we're going to make it a little bit of an investment specifically in technologies. We think about how we could enhance our customer experience. It's specifically around the sales process and some items like that. And so that's really where a piece of it -- in specifics to the controllable expenses in operations.","Paul Beldin","Yes. Austin, just to add a commercial for Keith here. In year-to-date, our controllable operating expenses are down 20 basis points. And because of these investments that Keith mentioned, we think we'll probably be closer to 5% or maybe slightly positive.","Austin Wurschmidt","That's helpful. No. You certainly have done a nice on the controllable side. Can you give us a sense of how large the tech investment is?","Keith Kimmel","I can't get into the specifics of it, Austin. Just, ultimately, what we're focused on is the customer experience and ultimately, hey, if we can also find a way that our team members also are benefited from all those things that we do.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just one more. Is it a onetime expense? Or is this going to be a recurring spend that we should expect kind of on a go-forward basis?","Paul Beldin","No, there's a -- Austin, there's a software element of it, that is capitalized and amortized over its expected life. So it's a mixture of both. But it's not a big movement. So it's in that.","Terry Considine","Austin, this is Terry. We've run controllable operating expenses basically flat for the last 12 years. And next year we will seek that again.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman.","Hardik Goel","I wanted to take the conversion maybe in a little different direction and just bigger picture. If you look at your portfolio where it is today and your market exposure, I know it's inside the greater LA and it's all over Los Angeles and it's not really in one submarket, but are you comfortable with where it is today? Where would you want it to be five years from now? And just your thoughts around your exposure.","Terry Considine","It's Terry. I like our exposure today. We have a wonderful portfolio. And 5 years from now, I hope it will be better.","Hardik Goel","Any markets that you think will make it better? Any markets you like right now more than others, where you'd like to densify?","Terry Considine","Well, we've talked about our interest in Florida, and we've outlined a couple of investments today that carry that forward. And going forward, we're both opportunistic looking for specific properties that have upsides as well as markets that are supportive. So it's a -- I don't want to predict what those opportunities might be.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC.","Richard Anderson","So first question is on Philly. I heard, Keith, I think you said a top market from a leasing perspective this quarter. I'm curious like if you guys think about how that market is trending? You're going to -- did something a little bit unique with your Philly trade a little while back? How is it trending relative to sort of those expectations going in? And could you become the Philly hero because of the efforts that you've made there?","Keith Kimmel","Rich, it's Keith. Thanks for the question. Listen, Philly, it started off strong. We have had a strong first half of the year. It's been tracking on our plan. I would just point out that our first quarter average daily occupancy was 97% in the first half, and it's 97.5% year-to-date. We continue to feel like Philly is a really special place and most importantly that our assets are very special and their locations. I'd also just point out, Park Towne Place, as we move past or lease-up, continues to show great strength and being really well received in the marketplace. And, of course, it will lend itself to why we've made the other decisions we've made to having more there.","Richard Anderson","Yes. I didn't even mean that pun about Philly hero. I just realized it.","Terry Considine","Sure.","Richard Anderson","And the next question is on Flamingo, big effort there. I'm wondering if a part of that effort will be to rebrand it. Flamingo kind of has sort of 70 sort of vibe to it, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. or something like that. I'm curious if there is a renaming or rebranding initiative that's going to go along with the whole redevelopment effort there?","Wesley Powell","Rich, it's Wes. I'd say, in general, yes. As part of all of our redevelopments, we kind of start first with the customer we want to attract and different customers are going to be drawn to different marketing campaigns and alike. So surely at Flamingo, we are looking to rebrand a bit. And with the investment create a new community that appeals to residents that are probably going to be slightly older than they were in the past and have higher propensity to pay large rents.","Richard Anderson","I think you should call it The Terry. I'm just saying in that sense.","Wesley Powell","I'd rather be called the Philadelphia hero.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question today comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James.","Buck Horne","I just wanted to -- I guess you guys have heard a couple different versions of this. But specific to New York, with the new rent control laws and the recent legislations there, does that create any sort of change in your -- how you operate those assets near term? And do you think about holding on to New York longer term?","Terry Considine","Buck, it's Terry. And there are some glances exchanged around the table because we have so little exposure to rent control in New York City, that we weren't 100% sure who should answer it. I think we have single digit, roughly 10 or 11 rent-controlled units. We have maybe 100 and change, 140 or so that a rent stabilized. That total investment is not very large. And in fact, if those buildings were torn down, which we can tear down, then the land values are greater than our carrying value for GAV. So we have a very limited exposure because we've always been cautious about that rent control market. ","That said, so going forward, there's not a lot of impact on Keith's operations beyond what those few I just said. And there's opportunity for Wes, who is in the teardown business as, for example, at 88th Street to look at particular sites and redevelop them in a market where there may be somewhat lesser competition because of the thoughtless regulation and legislation.","Buck Horne","Okay. All right. And just on the West Coast and California, I don't know if you've heard any updates on the latest. I know there's more chatter about the ballot initiative propped in 2.0 or something along that line. And how do you think about the exposure in California with this ongoing measures that are out there? And do you still remain comfortable with the allocation in California?","Wesley Powell","I do, but I'm also anxious too. So I mean it's comfortable maybe too strong. California is a wonderful market in terms of demand, in terms of consumer incomes, in terms of the properties we own and their locations. And so we like that exposure. It is possible that they will pass some rent control legislation that would be hurtful. We don't know that yet. It seems to me, and this is just as a outsider watching the legislative process, more likely that they pass something that will -- that they can say addresses rent concerns and has, perhaps, for, example one proposal that rent cannot be raised more than CPI plus 700 basis points. And then only -- that legislation lasts for only 2 or 3 years. So from my point of view that's a fig leaf. But it could be worse, it could be not at all. We'll just have to wait and see.","Operator","And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","So a question for you Terry, I guess. First, you've had sector-leading organic growth here the last couple of years, which hasn't necessarily translated into earnings growth. Some of that is dragged from asset sales, sale of the Asset Management business. And I think I heard Paul mentioned a 5% earnings growth target post the sale of this business. So I guess -- I'm wondering if -- should we be expecting Aimco to be closer to the upper end of the group, the peer group going forward? Or is there anything else that we're maybe not appreciating that could be a drag on the earnings growth going forward?","Terry Considine","Haendel, thank you very much. I think that's a very good question. The biggest impact on FFO growth in the last 12 months is, of course, the sale of the Asset Management business. And what that sale illustrates is our focus on net asset value creation, even if it results in short-term earnings dilution. Over time, those 2 metrics are to drive together, but we think net asset value is a measure that we use because it allows us to anticipate the effect of spending decisions we make today. And so, for example, during this second quarter, we will have emptied 707 Leahy in Redwood City, California. And we have emptied the North Tower in Miami beach. And so that'll show up in FFO as a negative -- as negative events. In fact, we see them as investments, as an opportunity to empty those buildings, so that they could be renovated on basis where we tend to get 10 -- double-digit free cash flow IRRs, but have short-term earnings dilution. And so, again, over time, those metrics should rise together. But we would expect FFO to lag that because it -- it's the outcome of those value-creation activities.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it, got it. That's helpful. How should we think though about disposition volume in paired trades and markets going forward? Beyond the $700 million that you mentioned earlier, is it your sense that we're getting to this end of this long-running process?","Paul Beldin","Haendel, no. I think it has been long-running. But I think we may just be beginning another cycle because what we're focusing on is not just the submarkets, but the opportunities for above-average gain. If you think about it, the difference in buying a stabilized asset in Redwood City would have an expected return today of probably under 6% and probably a NOI cap rate of -- with 3%, Haendel. And so -- but if we do a redevelopment, such as our 707 Leahy, we expect to have internal -- unlevered internal rates of return of double digits. So we're looking at not just at the submarket, but at the opportunity to earn above-average returns in those submarkets.","Haendel St. Juste","And one quick one, if I may. Did you -- or maybe can you share what the blended lease rates in July for this year compared to last year were?","Paul Beldin","Yes. Last year, there were 3.8%, and this year they're 3.9%.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes. So along similar lines from Haendel's last question. You guys mentioned you expect occupancy to be up in the back half of the year, but less than the first half. But occupancy was 96.6% in July. I think you averaged 96.8% in the second half of last year. So should we expect the occupancy to reramp as you've pulled back a little bit on renewals? Or is the comp materially different from changes in the same-store pool?","Paul Beldin","Yes, Austin. This is Paul. I guess I wasn't clear as I thought when I was talking about the occupancy comp. In the first half of last year, our average daily occupancy was 96.2%. We're at 97% the first half of this year. In the second half of 2018, our average daily occupancy, I believe, if I'm remembering correctly, it was about 96.6%. And so we expect to do better than that 96.6%, but rate of change is not going to be as great as it was in the first half. It's not a function of anything other than that.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to the management team for any final remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, Rocco, thank you very much for your leadership or conduct of this call. It's done well.

If you have particular questions, please give us a call, either Paul Beldin or Matt Foster on the IR team or Wes Powell, who spoke to it, and Keith Kimmel or me, Terry Considine.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you and good day everyone. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2016 and 2017. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Terry Considine, our Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you Lisa, and good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Aimco. Our business is good and we hope that yours is too. Before discussing our results, path and projected, I'd like to make sure that you know that yesterday we reported 2015 results, gave 2016 guidance and provided a financial model forecasting a 2017.","Paul made the decision to provide that forecast for the next two years to make clear to investors the impact of forward factors. First, same store NOI growth rates. Second, the long expected decline in non-core earnings as we continue the simplification of our business, for example the wind down of our low income housing tax credit activities and the reduction in the number of partnerships. Third, the dilution that comes from selling fully leased properties to acquire the Northern California lease up property that has no current income and fourth the savings in G&A and other offsite costs as we scale our overhead to our more focused business.","So for 2016, the headline is that we continue to think long-term accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. The short-term pain is a lower growth rate for AFFO this year, up only 4% compare to being up 12% last year. For 2017, the long-term gain is the reacceleration of the AFFO growth rate to 12% together with higher rent growth going forward, a better portfolio with higher average rents, a stronger balance sheet and improved quality of earnings.","We will return to 2016 and 2017 later especially in Paul's remark, but now I would like to direct your attention to a few highlights from last year. Last year in Property Operations across our diversified portfolio rent growth was higher than in 2014 by 50 basis points. In redevelopment strong consumer demand for our redeveloped apartment homes drove the lease up of Ocean House in La Jolla, absorption as above seasonal expectations at Park Town and The Sterling, Philadelphia. Second generation rent increases averaging 13% for occupancy stabilized redevelopment at Lincoln Place specific divestures [ph] and Preserve at Marin.","In portfolio management, fourth quarter average revenue per apartment home was up 10% year-over-year reaching $1,840 a record high for Aimco. And on the balance sheet at yearend we had $675 million of cash on hand and credit available on our bank lines and at yearend leverage as given by the ratio of leverage to EBITDA was down year-over-year by 11%. So the bottom line 2015 AFFO per share was up year-over-year by 12%, cash dividends per share were up year-over-year by 13%, and consensuses net asset value per share was up year-over-year by 11%. For these excellent results I thank my teammates and say well done.","Now let's look forward, when we look property by property at the Aimco business, we see unbalance continuation of the solid consumer demand of the past few years. In fact through January of this year the rate of year-over-year rent growth has been higher for each of the 12 consecutive months that is January 2016 rent increased at a faster rate than the January 2015. December 2015 rent increased at a faster rate than the December 2014 and so on, so for the past 12 consecutive months our rent growth has accelerated.","Now when we look outside our business, we're mindful of the potential for over building in some markets and we cannot help but notice the turbulence in financial markets and uncertainties about economic growth. These conflicting data points make us conservative. You can see that we project 2016 rent growth which is the closet to hand and most visible to us and roughly equal to and in fact a little bit better than the rent growth we've enjoyed for the past few years.","You'll also see that in our 2017 forecast, we decided to assume lower rent growth. We are not making the call on the market. As mentioned earlier in our portfolio rents have accelerated for 12 consecutive months and we have no visibility on a deceleration. We assumed lower rent growth for two reasons. First we want you to know that our 2017 forecast is quite achievable even if there were to be a slowdown. And second whether or not there is a slowdown in 2017 we all hope that markets will turn some day and we want you know what we are thinking and doing now to be prepared.","First, continue to emphasize our commitment for customer selection and customer satisfaction and we are increasing our investments in our site teams. Second, we're increasing capital spending to put our properties in top condition. Third, we are glad of our limited exposure to development and redevelopment and we're monitoring closely our exposure to lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition properties. Fourth, we appreciate our portfolio diversification across markets and price points and we're conscious about possible acquisitions. And fifth, we're guarding financial liquidity and are building balance sheet capacity to reduce dependence on financial markets and to support opportunistic investments if such can be found.","Now I would like to turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations who will review our fourth quarter results and a first look at the New Year. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I am pleased to report that we had a solid 2015 in operations with full year revenues up 4.5%, expenses up 2.1 and net operating income up 5.6%. Annually we achieved blended lease freight increases of 4.9% while maintaining an average daily occupancy of 95.9 with turnover at 48.6%. In Q4 of 2015 our residents gave us our ninth consecutive quarter of better than a four-star rating in customer satisfaction. As a result renewal rents increased 5.6% for the quarter, some 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2014.","We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 7% to 9% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing outperformed the results from the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each month of the quarter individually. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 2.1%. A 120 basis points better than prior year. New lease rates were particularly strong in the Bay Area, Atlanta, San Diego and New York City with increases between 6% and 12%. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points better than Q4 2014.","Turnover for the quarter was 50.7% and off the customers who decided to move out 23% were for career moves, 20% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. Our resident quality continues to improve.","The average income of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was 128,000, with a median income of 90,000. Year-over-year the median income of our new residents was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, due to an increase in household incomes and portfolio quality. Our 12 target markets which represent 90% of same-store net operating income, had top-line revenue growth up 4.6% in Q4. The top performers had revenue increases from more than 7% to nearly 11% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle followed by the Bay Area, New York, Denver and Boston. Our steady performers which had revenue growth of more than 5% to 7% were San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles.","And finally, with revenue growth of roughly 1% to nearly 3% we round out our target markets with Chicago, Washington DC, Miami and Philadelphia. As we look ahead to early first quarter 2016 results, January blended lease rates were up 4.2%, doubled our start to last year. New leases were up 2.9%, some 270 basis points better than prior year. And renewals were up 5.8%, a 160 basis points better than January 2015.","January's average daily occupancy was on plan at 95.8. 30 basis points better than prior year and February and March renewal offers went out with 5% to 7% increases.","Our expectations for 2016 revenue growth and our 12 historic markets can be broken into three tiers. At the top of the list with forecasted growth between 6% and 9% we at the Bay Area, Denver, Seattle and Atlanta, the mid-range of markets with forecasted growth of more than 4% of better than 5% are Boston, New York City, San Diego and Greater Los Angeles. In rounding other 12 target markets with growth of nearly 3% to 4% we have Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington D.C. and with great advantage to our tour teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to inter success.","I'll further call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith and good day to all of you. During 2015, we sold 11 properties with about 3,900 apartment homes with gross proceeds to Aimco of 386 million. These sales represented roughly 4% of our beginning in the year in real estate assets. We sold eight conventional properties with average revenues per apartment home of a $1043 per month 43% below the average of our retained portfolio and among the properties we sold were the last we held in Phoenix. ","We also continue to sell down of our affordable portfolios as the sale of three properties. On average the properties sold in 2015 had a free cash flow cap rate of 4.9%, had we held these properties for the next 10 years we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow of internal rate of returns of about 6%. Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions of property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return about 350 basis points higher than the properties sold to fund them. In particular we invested the 118 million in redevelopment projects during the year enhancing seven communities with a total of more than 2,500 apartment.","During 2015 we completed our multiyear redevelopment for Lincoln Place located in Venice, California and Preserve at Marin in Madera County, California. We also completed work at 2,900 on First in Seattle and Ocean House on Prospect located in Ohio County [ph]. We continue to redevelopment of two centers city Philadelphia properties which many of you saw during our Investor Day back in October, [indiscernible] 2015 saw the near completion of the redevelopment of one of the four towers that comprise the community as well as the community center. At the end of June we have leased 84% of the completed apartment homes in this tower with rents above underwriting and we anticipate completing the remaining apartment homes in the First Tower by the end of this month. ","Based on these successful results and Aimco approved the plan during 2015 to redevelop a second tower at Park Towne Place, with 245 apartment homes. We began de-leasing this tower during the fourth quarter and construction is underway. At the Sterling, we continue to enjoy good product acceptance, end of January we have leashed 97% of the completed apartment homes with rent above underwriting. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we approved a plan to continue to redevelopment of the Sterling with another five floors containing 130 apartment homes. And during 2015, we also invested the total of the 116 million in development about 100 million of this was in our One Canal property in Boston which will be completed in April and which we are preleasing now. We had also invested 60 million in the completion of Vivo, a property we acquired in Cambridge, which it was under construction. We saw our first move-in\u2019s of people in October and the property has 44% lease today at rents above underwriting. ","In addition to Vivo during 2015, we purchase this two other properties Mezzo, an operating property in Atlanta and Axiom a leased up property in Cambridge. A total purchase price for these three properties was $129 million. Our leasing at Axiom has gone very well with the property currently 89% leased at rents above underwriting and we expect to reach occupancy stabilization on this property during the second quarter. ","And finally as we discussed on our last call during 2015, we entered into a contract to acquire an under construction apartment community in Northern California for 320 million. We have commenced preleasing at this community and anticipate closing the acquisition upon the completion of construction this summer. The portion of the acquisition price will be funded through a property loan and the balance with proceeds from the sale of two properties. One in Phoenix and one is Alexandria, Virginia. ","During the fourth quarter noted earlier we closed the sale our Phoenix property and we anticipate closing on the sales of the Alexandria property in the second quarter of this year. ","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, John. Today I'd like to spend the few moments on our 2015 results after which I'll provide some details around our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release. ","First 2015. 2015 AFFO of $1.88 per share was 12% higher in 2014 and $0.03 per share ahead of our beginning of your guidance. 2015 same-store revenue growth of 4.5% was 40 basis points ahead of our beginning year guidance, while expense growth of 2.1% was 70 basis points lower than guided. Combined these results produce year-over-year net operating income growth of 5.6%, which was 90 basis points above our beginning of year guidance. As for the balance sheet at 6.8 times year in leverage was down 11% year-over-year. This reduction was accomplished in parts by using proceeds on our January equity offering to reduce that balance. Specifically we raised 367 million by selling stock at $38.90 per share and use the proceeds to reduce property debt and to repay our outstanding loan balance.","Today our unencumbered pool contains properties with a combine value of approximately 1.8 billion nearly double that of year-end 2014. Last week our Board of Directors, approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.33 per share. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 12% compared to the dividends paid during 2015. In short 2015 was a good year for Aimco with double digit AFFO growth, solid same store results, lower leverage and increase dividends.","Looking ahead, we feel good about our prospects. Our 2016 outlook and 2017 forecast provides more visibility into the four key factors, Terry mentioned that are expected to impact to Aimco\u2019s projected earnings they are same store growth, property sales and reinvestment activities, non-core earnings and offsite cost. I would like to take a minute to walk through each of this.","First, same store NOI growth. In 2016 we anticipate same store revenue growth between 4.5% and 5%, an acceleration of 25 basis points at the mid-point over 2015. We anticipate expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% up from 2.1% in 2015. This rate of expense growth is attributable to an increased investment in our on-site teams in 2016 which we expect will result in improved productivity and lower cost in the future. These increases in both revenues and expenses driver our expectations of 2016 NOI growth between 5.25% to 6.25%.","We also provided a financial model for 2017, in that model you will see revenue deceleration of 50 basis points from 2016 based on 60 basis point deceleration in new leases and a 90 basis point deceleration in renewal leases. We have no evidence to the fact there is such deceleration net across our portfolio, far from it. As Terry said we picked a conservative number to show that our 2017 forecast is achievable. Even if market weakens and to show that we are looking ahead to that inevitability of slower growth.","At the topline we show revenue growth in 2017 of 3.75% to 4.75%, this growth rate is based on the earn in the 2016 leasing activity, the renewal rates of 4.5% and new lease rates of 3.9% as estimated by third part data providers. We assume operating expenses increased 2.5% to 3% which is based on market level and pricing adjustments which are also projected by third parties, these assumptions 2017 NOI growth up 4% to 5.5%. So if these assumptions prove to, we will see continued strength in same store NOI growth albeit at a slower pace than in 2017, than in '16.","The second key factor impacting Aimco\u2019s AFFO growth is the effect of the sale of stabilized properties to invest in non-stabilized properties. The most impactful of which are One Canal, our development property in Boston, Vigo, property acquired under construction in June of last year and our Bay Area acquisition expected to close this summer. For 2016 we expect that NOI contribution from these three properties to be less than $0.01 per share, this normal contribution is more than offset by $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution from property sold to fund these investments. For 2017, we expect Vigo to achieve NOI stabilization by the end of the year and for One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition to reach stabilized occupancy of 95% by third quarter. Together we project these lease up communities will contribute $0.12 per share to 2017 NOI. As One Canal and our Bay Area acquisition achieve NOI stabilization in 2018 we would expect an even greater contribution to 2018\u2019s result. In short we are expecting short term pain in the form of 2016 AFFO dilution, but a long term gain provided by higher quality communities with growth prospects superior than the properties sold to fund their development or acquisition.","The third factor of our team Aimco's, AFFO growth is a long expected financial impact of the simplification of Aimco's business model. In 2016 the contribution to bottom line from non-core earnings is expected to decline by $0.08 to $0.12 per share compared to 2015. As a result of our gradual exit from the affordable and asset management lines of business and the reduced income tax benefits related to historic tax credits and are taxable REIT subsidiary. In 2017 we project a further decline in non-core earning of an additional $0.09 to $0.10. The fourth factor affecting Aimco's AFFO growth is the positive impact of reduced offsite costs that comes with our simpler business model.","As the complexity and scale of our business gains and we gain efficiency we expect these costs which include property management, investment management and G&A to decline by $0.02 in 2016 and an additional $0.01 to $0.03 in 2017. While we expect some variability in other components of AFFO, these four items are the primary drivers of our expectations for the change in 2016 and 2017.","In 2016, we expect AFFO will be in the range of $1.91 to $2.01 per share at a growth rate of 4% compare to 2015 notwithstanding the $0.05 to $0.07 per share dilution related to the property sold to fund the purchase of these sub-properties. In 2017 based on a stated assumption, we calculate AFFO would increase 12% at the midpoint to $2.12, to $2.26 per share. Assuming these rates of earnings growth, we see year-end 2017 leverage of approximately 6.3x, a reduction of 7% compared year-end 2015.","So to summarize, we see over the next two years better operating results and improved portfolio, simpler business with lower non-core earnings safer leverage, reduced offsite costs and increased AFFO per share, all of these accomplished without the need to access equity capital markets.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. If you could please limit your questions to two per time in the queue, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Terry, the portfolio on business changed a lot over the past few years, this year is a continuation of that strategy. So how do you think about a balanced portfolio and business transformation between the impact to NAV and the impact of cash flow growth?","Terry Considine","Nick, the key word there is balance and it's a little bit like riding a bicycle, you can't lean too far one way or the other. Over the years, our primary metric for the business has been net asset value plus cash dividends which a balance and it increases in that or what we call economic income. And so we focus on that first and you can see for example in 2016 net asset value will be much more predictable than the current income that we just discussed which is more volatile. But net asset value is closing to that overtime, is closely connected to cash flow. So again it's a question of balance.","Nick Joseph","Thanks then you able to confirm that the Northern California acquisition is the indigo in Redwood City?","Terry Considine","I am, thank you.","Nick Joseph","[Multiple speakers], can you remind us of the underwriting in terms of where you expect to be rents to be this summer and where rents are in the submarket today?","Terry Considine","Sure, John, do you want to take that.","John Bezzant","Sure, so Nick, I'll tell you that today we're in the middle of what I would call a soft opening preleasing scenario where we have started our preparations for preleasing. We will go live with that with staff in a marketing office at the end of this month and we will go full bore on a marketing program beginning in March. The rents that we have tracked for that marketing program as of today are some of our underwriting from where we thought that would be in June. And so that is based on comps and what the comps in the markets and submarkets, there have been through the last six months or so since we originally underwrote and tied the property up. And we feel pretty good about where are in the rent profile today.","Terry Considine","Nick, if I could just add to John's comments because of course we are focused on the lease of that property and we want to provide the most immediate and relevant information we can provide to the market as to whether our expectations are conservative or optimistic. It happens that we own four properties within -- the bulk of them within 2 miles to 5 miles of this property. In the fourth quarter, those four properties had rent growth of 10.3%. In January those four properties had rent growth of 4.8%. So what John has said is exactly right, rents today are higher than we underwrote and they're increasing faster than we might have expected.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, can you quantify how far ahead in terms of maybe a percentage they are today versus where you underwrote for June?","Terry Considine","No probably no. I don't want to go through all the details of the underwriting on a call like this, if you have a question come back offline and John can walk you through it. But there is 170 model types and it's just too complicated for this format. The next picture is rents are faster -- higher than we thought and are growing faster than we thought.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","Can you tell us, wondering if you could comment on the performance of A's versus B's in terms of the new leases and renewals?","Terry Considine","We monitor A's versus B's every quarter and what we really think is the best way to think about it is using new lease pricing as the best barometer and as we've looked at this past quarter our B's were outperforming our A's by about 70 basis points. And that's across most of our portfolio.","Jana Galan","And if you could just comment on the supplier outlook for the 12 core markets in '16 and then also what you're kind of forecasting for 2017 versus what you've experienced in 2016? And does any of these markets seem more susceptible to softness if job growth disappoints?","Terry Considine","Jana that's a tall order again for a call of this nature, the answer to that is very specific and detailed and not especially market driven, but more site specific. And so just at the top of my head to think about it and walk down the seaboard with you, so to be responsive. In Boston there is considerable supply coming into the CBD and Cambridge and it's being absorbed at or above our expectations.","In New York we have limited exposure to new supply. We're at a different price point. In Washington -- Philadelphia, excuse me, we have -- competitive new supply but our experience at Sterling and Park Towne is that we\u2019re being -- our product is being accepted at price points above our expectation in underwriting. In Washington DC we're -- our revenues are growing. There is continuing new supply but again it\u2019s at price points above our portfolio there.","In Atlanta there's competitive new supply, our rents there have been growing. In Miami we have a certain amount of disappoint, but it's not so much the overall levels of new supply to a specific location of them. And two of our major towers have constructions literally contiguously or across the street 24\/7 that make it a noisy place to live. And so you'll see that in our Miami results, in Chicago in the suburban markets where that portfolio is certain amount of new construction but not impactful today.","In Denver there's a significant amount of new construction, I think the Denver -- and this illustrates the point that it\u2019s got to be location specific and not market specific. It would be my opinion that the Denver market will soften, and perhaps it'll be difficult, but it's a market we\u2019ve avoided and so our properties that are grouped under Denver are in fact either on what we think of as an island at the Anschutz Medical Campus at University of Colorado Health Science Center or in Boulder where there is no growth ordinances that provides some protection against oversupply. So, more probably Denver\u2019s likely to be soft but not our assets as much.","Moving west, in Seattle we have a single asset in downtown Seattle and one in Renton. So, we can't be affected too much at all. In the Bay Area which is a course of -- a matter of concern to all REIT investors, as I've mentioned earlier the specific properties that we own and where we own them actually had a wonderful fourth quarter and wonderful January and so we do not now see supply in our markets, which remember we're not in the city of San Francisco, but we do not now see new supply impacting rent growth.","Los Angeles again there new supply continues but it's more moderate than other markets and rent growth for our portfolio which is primarily West LA continues and I would say the same would be true in San Diego. Now that's just top of mind. John, would you agree with that or floor that in a different way?","John Bezzant","I guess so.","Terry Considine","So, that's kind of we can -- maybe we can try to give you more detailed information if you have interest to follow-up on that, Jana but that's top of mind.","Jana Galan","And I guess this maybe a big picture, do you feel that your portfolio is going to experience peak supply in '16 or did that already happened in '15?","Terry Considine","Jana, I think it again depends on individual markets but if we were to take a picture I think the competitive pressure from new supply will increase for each of the next couple of years and so we -- as you know we made a great emphasis on being diversified in balance and it's my view that free marketing in time will be over build and so it's just it's also my experience that they\u2019re not synchronous and so by the time that the Bay Area is over built and rents do begin to ease, our hope will be, that will be offset by rent growth in Los Angeles or in Washington D.C. which are large and important markets for us. ","Operator","The next question comes from Gordon Saddler of Keybanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Gordon. In your guidance you guys are assuming -- so knowing NOI contribution from your development communities and I guess speaking to the Indigo acquisition specifically, what occupancy level really gets you to breakeven on an NOI and cash flow basis with that deal?","Paul Beldin","Hi, Gordon. This is Paul. As we look at the lease up of not only Indigo but all of the properties including Vivo and One Canal we are breakeven from a cash flow perspective at the NOI line in 2016 that excludes the impact of interest expense and so to cover that interest costs on that we\u2019d probably need an incremental cash flow of say about 5 million or so, so it's not a big impact but we expect that will recover in be accomplish in 2017 with the $0.12 of NOI growth that will expect to earn at that point.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the detail there. And then just looking at the $0.15 dilution that you attribute to assets sales, how much of that is coming from sales from 2015 versus what you expect to sell this year and then are the assets sales that you\u2019ve assumed in your guidance is that a gross amount or does that reflect your share?","Paul Beldin","Well the asset sales are reflected in the guidance are a gross amount which in 2015 happen to reflect the Aimco share what we expect to sell would be largely a 100% own properties. As far as the timing of this sales we expect to a large chunk about 300 million of that will happen in the second quarter and that's related to 2Q assets and the remainder of our guidance range would be towards the end of the year into the fourth quarter that sort of time frame. ","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay, thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stevenson of Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Can you talk a little bit about the, whether or not you see any sort of real material bifurcation and operating fundamentals across the various D.C, submarkets versus Maryland, Northern Virginia, the district itself, et cetera?","Keith Kimmel","Rob. This is Keith. I will walk through it. When we look D.C. over the past several quarters I've reported out that Maryland for us had been an outperformer against our suburban Virginia, but more particularly Alexandria markets and what would tell you is in this past quarter we saw a bit of the shift there and we saw that our suburban Virginia portfolio had outperformed Maryland and I think as you saw the walk through the year we continuously were increasing our revenue growth and in the fourth quarter 2.5% was our top performing quarter and we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re balanced I guess is more the bigger point here and the overall look is that we think 2016 will be better than 2015.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then in terms of that, how much occupancy gain is occupancy gain driving and I guess fourth quarter our average fourth quarter was like 95.5 in that market, is the lot of it just predicated on getting up the 100 basis points of occupancy in that market or are you really seeing attraction in rental rate and pushing rental rate as well?","Keith Kimmel","It's a little more on occupancy then I would say there in rental rate, but we are seeing strength in the rental rate. When we look back to the beginning of 2015 in this example there were still full 113 [ph] type of our negative 8% and that has really tapered off dramatically and so it's not nearly that type of discounting on the front door and the renewals continue to stay quite strong. To give an example we've been -- we averaged better than the 4% renewal in the market and that really was a turnover of only 44% and our decent portfolio really is what we think is a big driver there.","Robert Stevenson","Okay and then just lastly in terms of Indigo is there any material amount of retail there and then are you guys expecting that to stabilize occupancy wise by the end of 2016?","John Bezzant","There is no commercial, there is within the building a commercial condominium that will be occupied by a local credit union that actually owned a portion of the site prior to its construction. But we will not have an interest in that commercial space, so we\u2019re 100% residential on the building. And in terms of lease up, no we do not anticipate occupancy stabilize by the end of 2016. We would deem occupancy stabilization to be 95%, we think that's going to come probably third quarter of 2017 is what we\u2019ve got in our plan.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. So some of the $0.05 to $0.07 of drag earnings wise this year can be seen in the first half of next year as well until you get the occupancy full right.","John Bezzant","It will certainly be a fairly significantly acceleration to our results as we go throughout 2017.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, thank you.","Paul Beldin","And that continues to 2018, as you have the earn-in of full occupancy that we wouldn\u2019t have had in the first part of '17.","Operator","And next we have question from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Was wondering if can first comment on some of the trends of February and March renewals? I think you talked about those going out at 5% to 7% increases. Typically I think in the past you have talked about those coming back and getting finalized at 1% or so below that. Is that where you're expecting this case?","A - Keith Kimmel","Dan this is Keith. We are seeing more, it's typically within 100 basis points that we have talked about but we have seen it's been ranging between 50 and 100, so little less from what we send out as the ask in the ultimate take rate.","Dan Oppenheim","Got it. And so, but relative to January's 5.8% on renewals, some risk that we end up seeing some deceleration in terms of year-over-year growth in those February numbers then?","Terry Considine","I don\u2019t know, I mean mostly it gives unit by unit and property by property, Dan when we think about it. What I would say is this it could be just likely to be on par, but like I have said when the take rate is somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points, it's hard to say if it's could be 55 or 60 but it will be in that range.","Dan Oppenheim","Okay.","Keith Kimmel","Dan, its Keith, if you forgive me for jumping in. I think everyone at Aimco and I know I read your stuff carefully because I think you are very thoughtful about the market. And your exactly right trees don\u2019t grow to the sky and that supply will result in moderating price growth. I think that is surely right. What we can add where we have specific knowledge is that within our portfolio of today we don\u2019t see evidence of it happening now, it may will happen -- it will happen in the future, but we just don\u2019t see it happening now.","Dan Oppenheim","Okay thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Aaron Hecht of JMP Securities.","Aaron Hecht","So within your 2016 same store revenue guidance, how much benefit is there embedded from re-development properties?","Paul Beldin","This is Paul. Just for the benefit of the entire listening group. As we talked about in the third quarter we are adding total six properties to our same store pool for 2016 and those are Pacific Bay Vistas, 2,900 on first, 2,900 on first, 21 Fitzsimons, Tremont, Saybrook Pointe, and Eastpointe. And so the impact of those three -- of those six properties in totaled is roughly a 20 basis points impact of revenues for 2016.","Aaron Hecht","Okay so you be pretty close with the 2015 results exclusive of those redevelopment properties.","Paul Beldin","Yes.","Aaron Hecht","Okay, and then in terms of the rolling off of the tax credits over the next couple of years, does that give you guys the ability to accelerate dispositions on affordable product and how should we kind of think about that?","A - Terry Considine","Erin, this is Terry. You are exactly right, once tax credit are delivered and compliance period ends, then the properties are more marketable. We\u2019ve long said that we expect to liquidate those properties as those conditions are meet. And so we would expect to see that roll off.","Aaron Hecht","And is that disposition activity timed with the rolling off of the tax credits embedded in the forward two-year guidance?","Paul Beldin","Within the forward two year guidance, there is not the expectation or ability in that two year window to sell a meaningful portion of the tax credit properties, although we will continue to work with our investors to see if we can't straight a deal that would be beneficial to both us and them. John would you like to add anything?","John Kim","There is a time like between the delivery of the credit and a five year compliance period and so it's after the delivery of the credit. But during the compliance period when this properties will be sold and some of them will be sold in that first year and some won\u2019t be sold in end of this year.","Operator","And the next question comes from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin ","In the spirit of short-term pain for long-term gain, are asset sales to de-lever something that you thought about? I just know in the guidance, it has leverage going down at a slower rate than it has over the last year or two. Just curious whether there may be any kind of larger moves potentially in there? ","Paul Beldin","Hey Drew this is Paul. I\u2019ll start with that and then hand it over to Terry for his thoughts. If you look at our deleveraging that has been accomplished over the past few years, certainly a portion that was accomplished to property sales. But really what moved the dial significantly was the equity offering that we completed last January. And so as we put together our thoughts for the next few years, our focus was on keeping the total quantum of leverage about constant and that when you combine it was expected EBITDA growth provides the opportunities for a meaningful reduction and leverage ratios approaching the low sixes.","And so at that point as I think about it and as we have discussed as the management team here that feels right for Aimco and the Company, but we will of course continue to monitor what is appropriate given the economic environment. Terry?","Terry Considine","Well, Paul, I think you said it exactly right. For the moment we set our target to be between 6 and 7 times leverage or times EBITDA and at this time in the cycle would like to be closer to 6. We get there in these next couple of years and as always with Aimco you have to adjust that we have the safest balance sheet because we have the longest duration, we have the least exposure to refunding risk, the least exposure to re-pricing risk, the least exposure to entity risk and we don\u2019t have a business model that\u2019s as exposed to construction completion. So the balance sheet we think is in good shape today and continues to get better over the next couple of years.","Drew Babin ","And just a second question on your outlook for \u201916 and your guidance for \u201916 and your confidence in putting out a \u201917 outlook. Can you point to specific factors that give you the confidence necessary to go out two years with your assumptions? And I guess more specifically in the Boston market, do you expect any pick-up from GE moving their headquarters there? Is that something material that could benefit that market? ","John Bezzant","Maybe I'll speak to how we put together the model and then look to, to Keith or Terry to discuss the impact on the moving of the GE's headquarter to Boston. As we look to the model, the 2016 guidance was based upon the process that we have followed for a number of years and that is bottoms up property by property examination of those prospects all up, and that's how we set our guidance. For 2017 because that is a period that is beyond the time horizon which we have great visibility, we wanted to provide a model and so in that model we are using third party's expectations for what will happen in our particular submarkets for new lease rents.","We also have assumed what we feel is a conservative assumption regarding renewal rates where we are assuming in the 17 model a 4.5% renewal rate which is 90 basis points below what we have experienced recently. And so we think the combination of those two factors allow us to provide a broad range of potential outcomes for the investors to see what might happen under that set of particular sector set of facts and of course we will continue to operate the properties to the best for our performance and we'll see what we can do to beat that. And then I guess as far as our thoughts on Boston, Terry?","Terry Considine","John, as you said in terms of Boston, we kind of tuned into because of the recent activity we've had there and the coming delivery of One Canal. My understanding is that GE, the corporate headquarters move involves really only about 600 employees, so it's not going to be a dial mover for demand in downtown Boston that certainly is a big charge for the locals in terms of landing a major corporate headquarters and continued trends of definition of Boston as a major financial center. And so we got certainly good news but we don't think it's going to move the dial on demand in Boston.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Polosky of Green Street Advisors.","John Polosky","One follow-up to Drew's question there. What specifically would you need to see in the macro environment to change that two-year plan of gradual deleveraging versus ramping dispositions to de-lever more meaningfully? ","Terry Considine","John, thank you for the question, we'll have to see some consequential change better or worse to change our plan. Based on what we know today, we think that bringing our balance sheet leverage down further and faster isn't indicating. We appreciate your competence score of our leverage and we think that we're in the right place right now, if the world is a little different, we'll react.","John Polosky","Okay, last question. Should we interpret guidance for no new acquisitions in \u201916 and \u201917 as a hard commitment or a soft commitment, based on just the opportunity set you see today?","Terry Considine","John, I am really glad you asked that question because I think it's important to clarify that in the last five year we have sold more 200 properties, for more than $2.5 billion about one-quarter of our enterprise value and more than all or almost all of our peers proportionately. During that same time, we've acquired only 15 properties for about $600 million over five year. Our appetite for acquisitions is under control and its disciplined application is clear in the portfolio of transformation where rents have more than doubled over the past 7 or 8 years. When we look forward, we will continue apply that same paired trade discipline and only make an acquisition where it's clearly accretive into the advantage of our shareholders.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Kim of BMO.","John Kim","With 10% rental growth you're seeing in Redwood City, can you provide an update on your stabilized yield and IRR projections for Indigo? Is it as easy as adding 50 basis points to the yield, or is there --? ","Paul Beldin","It's just premature, it's premature John with -- John we'd like to be able to tell you specific commitment but I think we'd like to get down the road a little bit on leasing and see what we're at. And that maybe a more perfect question towards the end of this year once we've got some real leasing activity under our belt.","Terry Considine","What I would add to that is, as John told in the last call, our rent growth assumption after the lease-up or during lease-up is 3.6%. In our guidance and forecast we've assumed zero rent increase. And as we've pointed out what we're experiencing nearby remains strong.","John Kim","I think you flagged the time it's taken to stabilize, but is there something you could have done differently to neutralize the earnings dilution as far as structuring the deal, or maybe delaying the timing of disposition?","Terry Considine","Not especially. And this really goes back to a question that we had I think from Nick early on, which was, how do you balance your thinking about accounting and reported earnings versus net asset value creation and so forth? And we're highly focused on net asset value creation. We are mindful of current period earnings. We know we\u2019re going to have to explain short-term dilution. But we're not attracted to financial structures or accounting gimmicks mask or confuse the basic business we\u2019re in.","John Kim","Okay and then on your same-store growth in \u201917, it's noticeably lower than UDR, which is the only other company that's provided it. I realize, I think you're using market estimates, but you know your assets better than they do. Are you -- do you think your projections actually are reflective of what you're going to achieve? ","Terry Considine","What I would say John is first of all I want to talk about UDR. Because they're a terrific company and out here in the world of Broncos fans we all stick together. So, I don't want to in any way have a different view than what Tom and his very able team are doing. For Aimco we expressly did not make a forecast of what we think our results are going to be in 2017. And it's because as I said earlier we\u2019re seeing conflicting data.","When we look inside our own portfolio, we see acceleration not deceleration. When we read thoughtful analysts like Dan and we read our opinions of the responsive world markets and financial markets we see noise and concern and so what we did in 2017 forecast, as Paul said and I just want everyone to get it clearly. We've created a financial model it is not our forecast, it is not our making a call on rents, it's just as, if these things were to happen which is to say if the third-party data providers were correct that new lease rents were to drop by 60 bps and if our renewal rents were to drop by as much as 90 bps as Keith mentioned earlier right now that's going the other way, but as those things were to happen then this would be the impact in 2017.","John Kim","But isn't that like the tail wagging the dog? You know your assets from the ground up better. There are certain assets stabilizing in \u201917, or before then. The recent acts, you're either taking probably a ground up but also macro approach. I would think that we would want to use your estimates, or at least get your insight as where you think growth would actually be.","Terry Considine","Our insight is -- let me be clear, our insight is that right now everything we see is getting better and is accelerating. And so that, we also know that can't go on forever and we also know it's very hard to predict the future. And so when we look at 2017 what we want to do is give a model rather than a detailed opinion from the company.","Operator","And the next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico","I just had a question on your redevelopment development forecast, we're talking about $200 million to $300 million a year spending, basically I think you said going all the way out to 2018 in your two-year plan with new starts. I'm wondering how committed you are to that, because each time you start these redevelopments they are multi-years out, and you're selling assets at essentially the same cap rate where you're saying you're going to get your development yield, and yet you're getting the NOI from the redevelopment two years later. It just feels like a very dilutive process. I'm wondering how committed you are and how we should think about modeling this over the next three, four years, because I think it's one of the reasons why your 2017 forecast for FFO missed the Street.","Terry Considine","Nick, again this goes back to a very thoughtful question which was asked, the very first question by a thoughtful analyst which is you which is what is the balance between the current period profitability and net asset value creation? We do try and strike a balance, what we see in the redevelopment activities is there's typically a year or two before the current period profitability of the redeveloped assets catches up to that of the property being solid. I've forgotten right here, but I believe that in to the at 2015 property sales the free cash flow yield was just under 5% something like that 4 [ph] and change and that when we look forward that might take -- it definitely depends on the redevelopment what the cycle time is. So at Park Towne you can see the cycle time is probably six to nine months at another Ocean House it was over a year and so we try to do them in smaller bites where the cycle time as faster and trying to stay focused on long-term value creation and accept the terms","Nick Yulico","Okay, so it sounds like you are still pretty committed to this plan of doing that level of redevelopment through 2018, as far as spending goes?","Terry Considine","Absolutely. ","Nick Yulico","Okay, alright thanks Terry, sir.","Operator","Next we have a question from Anthony Pallone of JPMorgan.","Anthony Pallone ","If I looked at your DC, Chicago, Miami, Philly revenue trends in the same store in the fourth quarter, it's about just under 40% of your revenue. What needs to happen there in 2016 to get to your 4.5% to 5% total same-store guidance? ","Paul Beldin","Anthony. This is Paul. Early in the call Keith walks through kind of the expected ranges for each of our 10 markets and so, Keith do you mind hitting those expected growth rates for next year?","Keith Kimmel","Absolutely, I can walk you through that Anthony. In that grouping that is if the Chicago, Philly just remind me the other one you asked about?","Anthony Pallone ","D.C. and Miami. I think that four of those were about 10% in the fourth quarter.","Keith Kimmel","Yes. So the expectation is that they will range between 3% and 4% to make that happen.","Anthony Pallone","Okay. Thanks. And then just my other question, you have been in the market selling assets pretty consistently. Can you talk to any changes in either the bid lists or the composition, or how easy or tough it's been to sell assets now compared to say, a year ago? ","John Bezzant","Yes, Anthony. John Bezzant here. I would say the executing -- getting them sold and the pricing is really not a whole lot of different then it was a year ago. I think as we got into fourth quarter last year it got a little quieter. Whether that was that people fill their orders for the year whether just seasonal flow or whatever was that so maybe the bid list weren\u2019t quite as thick they were in June, but that's a pretty typical for the end of the year that slows down and every deal other we try to transact we transact it and transacted pricing we expected and that have gotten from the market is that's pretty similar across the board.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you operator, and thanks all of you on this call. We appreciate your interest in Aimco. If you have any questions of any kind, please feel free to call Elizabeth Coalson, Paul Beldin or me, and we\u2019ll do our best to answer them.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2014 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, EVP of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. Before my colleagues report on second quarter particulars, I'd like to point out a few highlights.","AFFO, adjusted funds from operations, per share, which is where Aimco measures current period profitability, was up year-over-year by double digits. FFO was up 6%.","In property operations, Keith and his team beat the high end of same-store NOI guidance by 140 basis points.","In portfolio management, second quarter revenue per unit approached $1,550, up 11% year-over-year. John and his team continue to sell our lowest-rated properties and reinvest the proceeds in properties with higher rents and better prospects. And of course, when we make investments, we follow a paired trade discipline, explicitly comparing what we buy to what we sell. We invest only where portfolio quality is enhanced, and the projected free cash flow internal rate of return is greater than that of the property being sold.","In redevelopment, we are on track to create more than $200 million of net asset value, about $1.50 per share. During the second quarter, construction continued at the revised pace and cost discussed in our first quarter call, while Keith and his team leased 90 redeveloped apartment homes a month at average monthly rents of $2,800.","On the balance sheet. In May, Ernie issued $125 million of preferred stock at a yield of 6.875%. Pricing was in the range for an investment-grade issuer, and providing confirmation of the market's confidence in the Aimco balance sheet and business plan. In the coming months, Ernie, Patti and their team will use the proceeds from this issuance to prepay property debt in order to increase the size of our pool of unencumbered properties. Our financial metrics are approaching Fitch's requirements for an investment-grade rating, and we expect to reach those levels over the next several months.","In sum, we're making steady progress on all fronts. For these good results, I'd like to offer sincere thanks to all my Aimco teammates, both in the room here in Denver, as well as across the country. It's a privilege and pleasure to work with you.","Now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid quarter in operations, with revenues up 4.1% year-over-year, 1.1% sequentially and 4.4% on a year-to-date basis. Our on-site teams demonstrated their deep commitment to providing world-class customer service to our residents. Through this dedication, we maintained low customer turnover and renewal rent increases averaging 5% for the quarter.","Of those leases that expired and were not renewed, new leases were signed at rates that were on average 4.7% higher than the expiring leases. The Bay Area, Miami and Denver led the way with new lease rate increases between 11% and 14%. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.9% for the quarter, the highest rate of increase in 7 quarters.","During the second quarter, we also increased occupancy, both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. Turnover for the quarter was 50.6%. Of the customers who decided to move out, 27% moved out for career moves, 17% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.","We continue to be successful in replacing move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average income of those new customers who moved in, in our same-store communities, in the second quarter, it was $131,000. The median income was $75,000, resulting in a rent-to-income ratio of 21%. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents versus those that moved in a year ago is up 9%, as we improve our portfolio and resident quality.","Looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up 2\/3 of our revenue. The top 4 performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% to over 8% for the quarter, led by the Bay Area, Denver, San Diego and Philadelphia. Our steady performers for the quarter, with midrange growth of over 4% to better than 5%, were Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and Orange County. And rounding out our 10 largest markets, we had Boston at nearly 4% and Washington, D.C., which improved by 60 basis points.","The third quarter is off to a solid start, with July blended lease rates up 5.6%. New lease rates were up 6%, and renewal rates up 5.3%.","July's average daily occupancy was 95.6%, 50 basis points better than prior year. August and September renewal offers went out with average increases of 6% to 8% across the portfolio.","And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver, for their commitment to Aimco's success. I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John E. Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. I'll provide today an update on our major redevelopment projects, as well as additional information on our transactional activities.","On the redevelopment front, we completed a quarter of solid execution. We invested $54 million in redevelopment projects across the country, and $8 million in our One Canal Street development project in Boston. In April, we completed the redevelopment of Pacific Bay Vistas, a 308-apartment home community in San Bruno, California. The community was 88% occupied as of July 30. We expect occupancy to stabilize above 90% in the coming weeks, which would mean bringing the community into our same-store portfolio in January 2016.","Construction continued at both Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera, California and at Lincoln Place in Venice, California. Work at each of these communities is progressing in accordance with the budget and schedule we outlined last quarter.","At Lincoln Place, 342 of the 391 completed apartment homes were occupied as of June 30. And 26 of the 36 completed apartment homes at Preserve at Marin were occupied on the same date.","Since quarter end, at Lincoln Place, we delivered the amenity building in the first of the newly constructed apartment homes, in time for a July 4 celebration. And just this week, we delivered the third of 7 apartment buildings at Preserve at Marin.","Finally, on redevelopment, during the second quarter, we expanded the scope of our project at 2900 on First in Seattle. You may recall that we started the interior phase of this project, including the renovation of all 135 apartment homes, earlier this year. The expanded scope includes the construction of new amenities, as well as a redesigned and upgraded common areas and commercial space. We expect to invest an incremental $8.2 million in these areas, and to generate an incremental $245 of revenue per unit from the investment. This additional work does not impact the construction and delivery schedules we disclosed last quarter.","We also had a successful quarter in our transactional activities. During the second quarter, we sold 15 communities, with approximately 2,500 apartment homes, generating gross proceeds to Aimco of $157 million. Four of these were among our lowest rated Conventional apartment communities, with average revenues per apartment home of $930, 40% below the average of our retained portfolio. We also continue the sell down of our Affordable portfolio, with the sale of 2 communities, and our partnership interest in 9 other Affordable communities.","On average, the communities sold during the first half of 2014 were sold at prices reflecting a free cash flow cap rate of 5.5%. Had we held these communities for the next 10 years, we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow internal rate of return of just over 7%.","As we maintain a paired trade discipline in our investment activities, investing the proceeds of these sales in higher growth, higher margin, higher opportunity communities, we continue to see improvement in the quality of our portfolio. Over the last 12 months, our capital recycling activities, combined with same-store revenue growth, led to an 11.4% increase in our portfolio average revenue per apartment home.","In July, we sold 1 additional Conventional community with 309 apartment homes, for gross proceeds to Aimco of $21.5 million.","Recently, we began actively marketing another group of communities that were originally planned for sale in 2015. By bringing these communities to market now, we take advantage of healthy buyer demand, as capital is plentiful and interest rates remain low. If we are successful in executing these accelerated sales, proceeds will be used in accordance with our paired trade discipline and may include pre-funding of 2015 redevelopment and development investments, selective acquisitions and\/or property debt pay downs.","And with that, I will turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, John. Before I discuss the results, I want to take a moment and apologize for the error yesterday in releasing earnings prior to the market close. We have controls and processes in place to ensure that those types of mistakes won't happen, but they obviously failed. I'm confident that it won't happen again.","Pro forma FFO of $0.52 per share was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by $0.02 of outperformance in property operations.","Turning to our balance sheet. As we previously announced, in May, we completed an offering of 5 million shares of a new class of perpetual preferred equity, our Class A stock, with a coupon rate of 6.875%. Proceeds from this offering were approximately $121 million.","Also in May, we issued about 117,000 shares through our Class Z Preferred Stock At-the-Market offering program. The shares, which have a coupon of 7%, were issued at $25.65 per share, equating to a yield of 6.8%, for proceeds of $3 million. Both series continue to trade at a premium to par, equating to yields between 6.6% and 6.8%.","Proceeds from these issuances will be used to pay off 5 property loans in the second half of this year. This will increase the size of our unencumbered pool of apartment communities, from $570 million today to between $900 million and $950 million at year's end. This puts us very close to the requirements sent out by Fitch, around having an unencumbered pool of $600 million of assets, using a stressed cap rate of 8%.","Looking ahead, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.48 to $0.52 per share for the third quarter. Full year 2014 pro forma FFO per share is projected to be $2.04 to $2.12, which is an increase of $0.01 at the midpoint compared to the guidance we provided last quarter.","Our updated guidance includes the following increases: $0.02 from second quarter outperformance; $0.01 from higher expected same-store NOI growth during the second half of the year; and $0.01 from higher projected tax benefit in the second half.","These increases are offset by $0.02 of prepayment penalties that we expect to incur mostly in the third quarter, in connection with the early repayment of property debt, and a net $0.01 increase in funding costs, which includes $0.03 of additional preferred stock dividends due to second quarter's issuances, offset by $0.02 of interest savings from the property debt we will pay off with the proceeds.","Specific to the updated tax benefit projections, about $8 million has been recognized through June 30, of which about $5 million represents the historic tax credits from Lincoln Place.","Looking to the second half of the year, we expect third quarter tax benefit to be about $4 million, of which $3.5 million represents the historic tax credits. And we expect fourth quarter tax benefit of about $5 million, of which $4.5 million is from historic tax credits.","At the AFFO line, we are projecting $0.34 to $0.38 per share for the third quarter, and full year AFFO guidance has been maintained. The $0.01 increase in FFO guidance is offset by anticipated increased capital spending.","As to operations, year-over-year Conventional same-store NOI growth is projected to be 3.25% to 4.25% for the third quarter. We are increasing our full year Conventional same-store NOI guidance to a range of 4.5% to 5.25%, or an increase of 87.5 bps at the midpoint.","Supporting our increased expectation for NOI is a higher revenue projection of 3.9% to 4.2%, and a lower expense expectation of 2.25% to 2.5%.","As you can see from our full year guidance, NOI growth for the second half of 2014 is expected to be lower than what we achieved in the first half of the year.","Let me take a few moments to walk you through the various pieces. I'll refer to our year-to-date results on Page 2 of our earnings release.","Year-to-date, our rent per apartment home is up 3.1%. We expect an acceleration in rental rate in the second half of the year.","Other income, which makes up about 10% of our property revenues, is expected to be up around 5% in the second half, which is a deceleration from the first half's 11.3%. This deceleration is consistent with our thoughts from the beginning of the year. We had outperformance with utility reimbursements in the first quarter due to the cold winter.","Average occupancy was 30 bps higher than last year in the first half of 2014. We expect to continue to have an outperformance to occupancy in the second half, but a bit lower than what was achieved year-to-date.","Regarding expenses, we have more difficult comps from prior year second half, so we anticipate a higher expense growth rate.","On the transaction front, as John mentioned, we are looking to complete some additional asset sales during the second half of the year. These sales and the reinvestment of proceeds are not contemplated in our current guidance, as the timing and magnitude are uncertain at this point.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Laura, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ernie, can you just talk a little bit more about the decision to pay off the property loans and then also increase your capital spending? Because if you hadn't done either of those, the boost from your same-store NOI guidance going up would have created even more of a FFO and AFFO guidance raise.","Ernest M. Freedman","Nick, be happy to address that. I think first and foremost, we're thinking long-term about what we want to do here in Aimco, and not so concerned about what short-term results may be on our earnings profile. And for both of those items that you mentioned, let me talk about that, so you can understand a little bit more about how we think about things long term. I'll start with the capital costs. We do expect our capital replacements to go up about $0.01 in the second half of the year, as we have the opportunity to invest long term in our assets, and do that today. And it's really accelerating things that we could've done tomorrow or next year. So we'll actually have a better profile for the company and better assets by getting that capital done today, because our teams have done a good job in executing what they've had on their plate and have capacity to take on some more. It's not really a different story around what's happening with paying off the property debt. We like the idea of making a trade of putting in place perpetual preferred equity with no maturity date, at what we felt was a very good price of 6.875%, to pay off property debt that was coming due anywhere in the next 3 to 6 years. There's certainly a cost to doing that. And we looked at it from a payback perspective, and based on where those interest rates were on the loans that we were paying off, we think it's a pretty quick payback, it's about a 2 to 3 year payback. And so, we have the benefit of putting the balance sheet in a safer position and a better position by bringing on some preferred equity. And we also have the benefit then of getting much closer to the target that's been set by Fitch, with regards to the size of the unencumbered pool that they would like, and really have us knocking on the doorstep of getting to investment-grade, hopefully here in the next few months, as Terry talked about.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then back in NAREIT in June, you had a good slide showing the next wave of larger redevelopments you might start over the next 3 years. Can you provide some updated thinking on these projects and the possible size of them and whether any might be as impactful to your NAV as Lincoln Place looks like it'll be?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. No, Nick, appreciate the question on redevelopments. The answer is, as John and his team continue to make progress on the planning on some of those projects, and we would anticipate some of those that we laid out on that slide will be -- some may start here as early as late 2014 and some going into 2015, and we do believe each of those has an opportunity for some nice NAV accretion. I'll turn it over to John, maybe to talk about a few of the specifics.","John E. Bezzant","Yes, from the slide, we would expect we are in kind of final planning process on the project out in La Jolla, that we would hope to have formally approved and announced later this year. A project in Philadelphia, Park Towne, we did review with our investment committee and we're getting ready to move forward there, as we look to this build-out of an initial phase at Park Towne. We are in final planning of numbers, timing and cost there, that will be in our next quarter's report. And then we have a handful of others that are in a planning process, a project in Chicago, and others that we'll talk about as we get a little more definition to them and release in our schedules in the future.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Any rough numbers you can give on Philly right now?","John E. Bezzant","Not yet. I mean, we're -- I'd rather complete the final planning and get it formally into the report before we release the numbers on it.","Operator","And our next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One of your peers announced they're exiting the new development business. Terry, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that business for Aimco going forward?","Terry Considine","Nick, thank you for the question. It's, as you know, it's something that is not a major focus for Aimco, and yet it's something that we've done from time to time over the past many years. I think of Palazzo being a good example of that. And as we look at One Canal today, we're quite pleased to be doing it, and so it's a tool in our toolkit that we'll use where appropriate.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you think you get the credit for development in, kind of in the stock price? And I'm also wondering if you're looking at any additional land sites right now?","Terry Considine","We focus on creating financial results. I'm never quite sure about the linkage between creating net asset value and the share price. Over time, I think there's a, maybe a correlation. And we look at it in our paired trade discipline of free cash flow, internal rate of return expected, and with this very significant risk adjustment, if we're undertaking development work. And where it makes sense, we'll do it. And I've kind of forgot what your second question was.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It was if you're looking at any additional land sites right now, or just focusing on the Boston development?","Terry Considine","We're -- we have lots of conversations with the market. There are lots of opportunities that are presented to us. We look at many, many possibilities and do very few.","Operator","And next we have a question from Ryan Bennett of Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just to follow up on your comments on the operations. I think you said occupancy so far this quarter is running slightly below where you ended the quarter. Is that just a function of you being more comfortable where new move-in lease rent growth is right now, for your portfolio, and you're willing to take the additional turnover?","Ernest M. Freedman","No -- Ryan, it's Ernie. If Keith wants, Keith could chime in as well. We typically see occupancy come down from June to July and from July to August, mainly just due to the number of turns. Mostly, those 2 months have the most turns for us in our portfolio. Our average days outstanding are right around 20, 21 days, and just because there's more turns, we typically have a little bit lower ADO. We're actually tracking higher than we did last year. Keith, you want to, maybe you want to give some comps of what July looked like last year, compared to this year?","Keith M. Kimmel","Ernie, thanks. Ryan, if we look at it year-over-year, we're actually 50 basis points ahead of where we were last year, looking at July. So we're feeling good about where we are in the position and as we get into peak season, we want to take advantage of that new lease price, that we're achieving it, 6% in July and 6.2% in June.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And then, just on that new move-in lease growth that you've been seeing accelerating over the past few months. Is that a pretty clean number, in terms of -- is there any impact of signing more leases in some of your higher rent growth, or sorry, higher rent per unit markets? Or are you thinking that is a pretty clean number, in terms of the momentum you're seeing?","Ernest M. Freedman","No, that's a clean number, Ryan. We're just -- we're seeing very good rent growth coming off of the numbers from last year, and it's not skewed one way or the other, based on where it's happening in the markets. We're seeing occupancy up across the board. So we're not, compared to where we were last year. So it's clean.","Operator","The next question today is from Rich Anderson of Mizuho.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So I don't remember what the story was last quarter, but the preferred offering, in terms of the timing, did -- was that a bit of a surprise move? I was thinking, in terms of your approach for an investment-grade rating, one of the reasons isn't so much to issue unsecured debt, but it is to get better pricing on preferred. So did that kind of get triggered a little bit sooner than you thought? Or was that always in the game plan?","Ernest M. Freedman","I would say, Rich, it's always been in the game plan. We certainly have been talking about it for a long period of time, and we'd actually set up the necessary paperwork with the various bankers back in September of 2013, to be prepared to be able to take an advantage of a moment in the market. And we've been pretty clear with folks that we wanted to see if we can achieve a price better than 7%. And we thought there was a window there very quickly in May, that we might be able to accomplish that, and we did. And you're absolutely right, Rich, we probably would get slightly better pricing on our preferreds. Although we did price them between 2 investment grades, and interestingly enough, with that preferred offering. Public Storage, who I think most people would consider the top of the top, in terms who issues preferreds, their paper, just been issued at about 6.375% a few months before us, and there was some -- another investment-grade company out there that was at over 7% with their preferred. So the fact that we kind of came in between the 2 gave us confidence, or showed us that the market seems to think we have a pretty safe balance sheet and pretty close to investment grade. It's kind of what comes first, the chicken or the egg. And to get to investment grade, Fitch has been pretty clear, they want a larger unencumbered pool, and by not doing the preferred, we would get there, but it would certainly take us a longer period of time. So that's why we like doing a smaller preferred then, Rich, and certainly, if we can get that kind of credit rating from Fitch here, soon, in the next many months, it could certainly open us up for even better pricing for preferreds in the future, of course, depending on where the 10-year Treasury's trading at that time.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Right. And then big picture question for Terry, I guess. What do you think, is this the optimal, economic kind of environment for multifamily, sort of a Goldilocks type of situation, where you're not getting overheated, and hence you're not inciting development, but you still have enough, kind of household formation, maybe not so much, but job growth, to feed the business? Would you like the economy if it were just your business, the only thing you cared about, would you like the economy to stay right about here, or would you like it to be stronger?","Terry Considine","Rich, I think you've described it correctly as a Goldilocks economy, that it's not too hot, not too cold, and it's quite good for the apartment business. And I think that we and our peers and private competitors are all doing well, and I think that our prospects are quite good.","Operator","And the next question is from Jana Galan of Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on your Southern California portfolio's performance. I know you are feeling very good about that market heading into this year. I'm just curious if it's meeting or exceeding expectations and particularly, what happened in San Diego.","Keith M. Kimmel","Jana, it's Keith. Let me walk you through, and I'll walk you through San Diego, Orange County and L.A. If we start in San Diego, a couple of good things going on there. First being that, the occupancy in the second quarter was at 96.5%. And we're starting to see some new lease growth coming in. In Q2, our new leases were up 8.6%. And so, we're starting to build some momentum, obviously that translated into a revenue of 6.1% in Q2. And of course, I wouldn't want to miss that we really have a very solid team out in San Diego, and they really executed well. Moving into Orange County, Orange County continues to be a solid market for us. Had some good results there. One thing I would just point out is that it's been steady for us. And over the past couple of quarters, we've been in the mid-4s, and we're pleased with what's going on there. And then in Los Angeles, where we think we have an advantage is that we just have, we believe, some of the best located assets in West L.A. And we're seeing some good growth there, we're taking advantage of it, and we're looking forward to the second half of the year.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then also, on your West Coast expenses, they're down pretty significantly year-over-year, is that primarily insurance?","Ernest M. Freedman","Jana, I don't have the answer specific for West Coast. Across the board, we had some good guides in insurance, as we -- when we got our latest actuarial results from our actuaries around our general reserve liabilities. We had a good guide to pick up there, and that was spread amongst all of our properties, not just the West Coast. I'll take a look at the numbers separately, Jana, after the call and give you a call back, to see. But nothing, I don't recall anything else that stuck out specifically for the West Coast on expenses.","Operator","The next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So one for, I guess you, Terry. You talked in the past about your optimal long-term portfolio balance on the quality spectrum: 40, 40, 20, A versus B versus C. I was wondering if perhaps you've given some thought recently or perhaps gone through the exercise of assessing your optimal long-term geographic or market exposure balance, and perhaps can you share some thoughts or perspective on how you're looking at your market balance today in light of the current acquisition market opportunity, the varying revenue growth outlooks for different regions of the country. And assuming you could snap your fingers and instantly shift some capital from your other markets, which look to be about 15% of your conventional NOI, where would you like to add to your portfolio, given the current asset pricing in the marketplace and the near-term growth outlook? And where amongst your current top 20, your target market, would you also potentially like to rebalance from your current NOI exposures?","Terry Considine","Well, Haendel, that's quite a question. I'll try to answer it as best I can. The first point is that Aimco is very committed to a geographically diversified portfolio. It's my experience that all markets fluctuate over time, some are good now and some are bad now, but they'll reverse in the future. And to provide steady and predictable growth and returns to our shareholders, we want to be appropriately diversified. And so we like our strategy. And turning to our strategy, which is unchanged, we would like to improve our allocations to Boston, bringing more capital from the outer suburbs and into more urban locations in Boston and Cambridge. And in New York, we'd like to increase our allocation. We're under-allocated there. And in San Francisco, or the Bay Area in general, we're under-allocated, and we'd like to increase our allocation there. Seattle, we're under-allocated and we would like to increase our allocation there. In all of those markets, we are in an environment where apartments are highly priced, and that's great when we're selling assets on one side of the paired trade, but it makes us cautious about investment on the buy side of the paired trade. Much of what we are doing in terms of buying or reinvesting is, as you know, through redevelopment and development. And from time to time, John will find a particular property with a particular appeal, or where we have an opportunity to add value, and you'll see that be part of our capital allocation process. John, was -- is there anything you want to add to that?","John E. Bezzant","No, maybe just one thing. The, Haendel, just keep in mind that with the paired trade, we are really looking for accretive investments. And so to the extent we can find them, we bought in the first quarter a couple of little buildings in New York, which is a highly priced market, but we happen to find a deal that was -- a couple of buildings, adjoining things we already owned and we were able to get a transaction executed that was accretive for us, and made sense. And really, that's the math that we look at, and so, while there are markets where we would love to put more dollars to work, we've got those dollars to work someplace else right now. And we continue to look in nooks and crannies for opportunities, and we think we'll find a few here and there, but it's not going to be a mass exodus. Unfortunately, we can't just snap our fingers and move from one to the other.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A follow-up to that, your stock has run quite a bit here year-to-date and is trading around NAV or slightly above, depending on whose numbers you believe. Given your improved cost of capital, are you ostensibly inclined more towards acquisitions? Is your stock at a point yet where you can, would consider using it, stock or units, as currency in pursuit of external growth here?","Terry Considine","Well, Haendel, first, you're correct that the stock's had a good year to-date. But in our view, it continues to price at a significant discount to net asset value. And I think that it's a discount to consensus, but more importantly, it's a discount to the more informed analyses. Because the market tends to look at the cap rates of the properties we're selling, without making a sufficient adjustment for the fact that we're selling off the bottom and investing in higher quality, lower cap rate assets. So I think that what lies ahead is an opportunity to close that gap, and that's probably our first priority before we think too much about equity issuance.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. Then one last, if I may. Ernie, can you talk a little bit more about the 2Q expense results, it came in well below our expectations. Can you talk a bit about how much that number benefited from perhaps, lower-than-expected taxes versus maybe your cost efficiency initiatives?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Happy to do that. As I mentioned earlier, in the previous question, we definitely had a benefit in expenses. They are going to be a onetime issue, with regards to adjusting for some reserves for general liability, and that certainly had some help. Across the board, we're seeing good things across all the different expense categories, Haendel. Property taxes are coming in about where we expect for the year. So no surprises that are material in either direction, both either a favorable or unfavorable. We still expect real estate taxes to come in about 4% to 5% up for the year, which is our biggest expense that you'll find on our operating statement. We continue to make good progress on payroll. We're very pleased with that. We do have some timing issues with repairs and maintenance. We do expect repairs and maintenance costs will go up a little bit, compared to prior year, compared to what we've seen in the first half. So I would give some of that outperformance that you're seeing year-to-date around timing with some of our repairs and maintenance. We expect that to come back in line. Utilities certainly have been higher than we would have anticipated. Second quarter came in more in line, but the first quarter numbers were much higher than we expected. And we're seeing some good things around what's happening with marketing. And then again, back to our personnel costs, we continue to see some nice progress, in terms of being able to control our costs associated with personnel in the field. And July 1 is our -- when we do our merit increases, and those went through at slightly under 2% on average across the company. And we're confident we'll find ways to offset that increase through productivity, to continue to keep personnel costs in that flattish range. And I looked at the numbers this morning, Haendel, and for all operating costs exclusive of utilities, insurance and taxes, we had told earlier, we told folks early this year we expect to keep those under 1%. And right now, it looks like we'll keep those right around 0.5% increase, versus a 1% increase. So Keith and his team continue to do wonderful things on expense control for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","John, earlier you provided some insight on potential incremental disposition plans. I think we missed the magnitude of those potential sales. Could you remind us what that is, and talk a little bit about the likely mix of Conventional versus Affordable?","John E. Bezzant","Sure, I'll give you a little bit of color, maybe not the level of precision you want, but I'll give you some, how's that? We've intentionally not provided precise guidance, because we don't quite know yet how much of it will transact, we are looking opportunistically in multiple markets, primarily on the Conventional side, to see what the market will bear, kind of back to Haendel's question about portfolio reallocation. In large measure, our reinvestment opportunities are driven by how good an execution we can get on the sale side. And when we get a better execution, that provides us some capital that is maybe reinvestable at a more market rate today. And if we get those good executions in the fall, I think you can anticipate us seeing a fairly high level of activity on the sale side. If they're not there, or if there's some sort of a disruption that would cause the market to freeze up a little bit, then we would have less, but I don't have a good number to give you right now in terms of magnitude order. But we're chasing a lot of deals. We have a few hundred million dollars' worth of deals out in the market today, and -- but I don't know how many of them are going to get closed.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think the acquisitions on a one-off basis, debt repayment and pre-funding redevelopment are mentioned as potential uses of those sales proceeds. Terry or Ernie, can you rank the -- your preference for those 3 items, based on what you see today?","Terry Considine","I think it's a question of balance. I don't think we're going to select one or the other. But we -- our overall strategy is to provide steady, predictable growth, and so it's a question of which particular acquisition opportunity provides an attractive risk-adjusted return. I would not expect to see the rate of development and redevelopment spending increase beyond the range that Ernie has established, of $200 million to $300 million a year. And on the debt reduction side, there's a possibility that we could accelerate the debt reduction and delevering on the company. Again, as John pointed out, a lot depends on the pricing of the assets we're selling.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and Terry, regarding your answer to Haendel, is it your perception that the quality of the Conventional portfolio or the Affordable portfolio is more misunderstood by the market?","Terry Considine","I'm not sure I'm knowledgeable enough to -- of everyone's models and markets, but I think you have done particularly good work at your firm on the Conventional portfolio pricing. And I think that the Affordable portfolio, which has become a much smaller, single-digit percentage of our GAV, is not as especially important to the market's understanding of our NAV per share.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the last question just relates to potential disposition plans on the Affordable side, since your -- the sales year-to-date, and it sounds like over the balance of the year, have been more heavily concentrated on Conventional. Terry, can you just update us on the intermediate and long-term plans for your Affordable exposure, and what that disposition environment looks like today?","Terry Considine","Well, John will give the details, but Dave, let me just point out that year-to-date, we have shed 20 or 30 properties...","John E. Bezzant","50. 15 on the Affordables.","Terry Considine","15 Affordable Properties. And so, what you have is a quite consistent steady runoff of that business. And I think that John's done a wonderful job of executing it, and I don't see it being accelerated, unless the pricing is particularly attractive to us. Is that responsive to your question?","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I must be missing something, I see 4 sales year-to-date on Page 24, but maybe you mentioned some third quarter sales that I'm not...","John E. Bezzant","Dave, let me walk you through them a little bit. So we've got, what you're seeing on the 4 Affordables are Affordable-owned, I think it's important that -- to make sure that we draw the distinction. What we call and classify as our Affordable business comprises assets that are essentially 100% owned by Aimco, or majority-owned by Aimco. And they are our low-income housing tax credit business, all of which gets, if you will, consolidated into this 8% number of our GAV. The Affordable-owned business is literally down to a handful of properties today. There are, through the course of the rest of year, we have scheduled really in the fourth quarter, we don't anticipate any other, but we do have scheduled in the fourth quarter a few more sales out of that Affordable-owned portfolio. On the low-income housing tax credit portfolio, those are properties that we look to sell at the end of either the tax credit flow period, or the tax credit compliance period, where we work with our investor partner that has invested initially in the tax credits when we did the syndication. And that is the portfolio that we'll sell off, and if you will, bleed down over time, as we reach the end of those various periods. And so from a sales standpoint, as we look forward, we would anticipate a multiyear sell off of that under our current plans, as those compliance periods mature.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, the sales activity, that wouldn't -- you guys have plenty of cushion from a tax standpoint to distribute, is that right?","Ernest M. Freedman","For where we're at today, Mike, we do. I mean, of course, depending on what may happen going forward, if there is an acceleration of sales, we'd certainly have to look at that, and see how that would play in with regards to requirements around our dividends.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Second of all, Keith, did you mention what turnover actually was for the quarter, and how that compared to a year-over-year?","Keith M. Kimmel","Mike, I did. It was 50.6, compared to a year ago at 49.8. So pretty much right on top of each other.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And finally, Ernie, last quarter you talked about some potential tax benefits that you could recognize in '15 or '16. Can you just give us an update where you stand on that, kind of the expectation at this point?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. I think Mike, what you're referring to is the fact that we have historic tax credits currently in Lincoln Place. We do expect to recognize most of those in 2014, as John wraps up the construction there with his team. Some of those may bleed over into 2015. We do have 2 other redevelopment projects that are eligible for historic tax credits. Both are in Philadelphia, Park Towne Place and the one that we have ongoing currently, Sterling. And there may be the opportunity for us to do 1 of 2 things. Of course, with historic tax credits, these are a real asset for someone, whether they're in our hands or in someone else's hands. In the past, we've sold those to others and monetized them. Where the market was last year, we thought it was best and most economic us to use them for ourselves, because we had uses for those within our taxable REIT subsidiary. We'll make the same determination with Park Towne and Sterling as we get closer to the point where those are certain, and those are, can be monetized. But there is absolutely that potential for us, Mike, from both of those projects, to generate tax credits either for sale, and we'd recognize them as nonrecurring income, or to recognize them ourselves in our taxable REIT subsidiary. And that would then flow to the tax benefit line item. Unfortunately, I don't have a better update for you as to how -- what those numbers could be.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then just finally, just in terms of updated spend on the redevelopment, capital upgrades and stuff. Can you just give us an update there, it sounds like the maybe, it may be a push-pulling some of that forward this year, so just curious as to what the spend plan is there.","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure, in talking -- I'll make sure I address it correctly, Mike. We did talk about on our guidance, that we're spending a little bit more in capital replacement spending. That is completely separate from our redevelopment program. So there, we've had the opportunity to increase what we call our appliance program, where we're putting in newer appliances to replace older appliances a little faster than we expected. As well, we've been talking for the last couple of years about our wood flooring program, where we have our acetylated wood flooring that is replacing the soft surface of the carpeting. And the team continues to track ahead of pace, and doing better in terms of what it's costing us to do it. It's costing us less, it's given us an opportunity to do a little bit more this year, which will, over time, give us better returns on the rent side, but importantly, also bring down our overall costs. So it's really mutually exclusive from where John is on pace currently, and expectations have not changed from when we talked about, with regards to our redevelopment projects.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's more in the -- that's separate from the bucket there. Do you have an updated cost projection for that or no?","Ernest M. Freedman","Cost projection for which, Mike?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The -- you talked about the flooring, you talked about appliances. Relative to the guidance you gave, which had capital replacements, and all the different ones, do you have an updated forecast for that?","Ernest M. Freedman","Let me give you a call offline, Mike, just to make sure I don't mix it up. We haven't talked specifically about what we're going to spend on each of those programs. In general, we're going to spend about $1 million to $2 million more in the second half than we would anticipate. I'll give a call offline, and we can make sure we're on the same page with that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Thank you. As many of you know, last week Aimco celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. At the time of the Aimco IPO, Peter Kompaniez was my partner, Lanny Martin was our Lead Director and Leeann Morein was our Chief Financial Officer. And happily, all 3 remain my friends and colleagues today. We were excited then by the opportunity presented by the IPO and went to work. Back then, there were more than 30 public apartment REITs. Now there are 10. These 10 have grown larger and better capitalized, and become more expert business enterprises. We've learned a lot from our competitors, who of course, are also our friends. For Aimco, over the past 20 years, we've provided apartment homes to several million families. We've increased our enterprise value from $315 million to more than $10 billion, and increased our stock market capitalization from $168 million to more than $5 billion. We've seen Aimco shares included in the S&P 500, and we've provided a return to shareholders comfortably ahead of the equity REIT indices, and even further ahead of the S&P 500. And -- but while the business and financial results of the past 20 years are gratifying, my greatest satisfaction comes from working with so many extraordinary colleagues. It is they who make Aimco a top workplace in our state, and it's they whose friendship I treasure.","Looking forward, I'm optimistic about Aimco's prospects, and I'm energized by the opportunity to work with the entire Aimco team to achieve still more for our customers and for our shareholders. So I thank you for interest over the years, and for your interest today. If you have questions, please call Elizabeth Coalson, Ernie Freedman or me. We look forward to when we're next together. Thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President, General Council. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2016 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s Web site.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations, John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa and good morning to all of you. We appreciate your interest in Aimco. Aimco portfolio diversification across markets and price points is serving us well. Business remains good and on plan, notwithstanding the predictable ebb and flow of various local markets.","We hear lot of questions about the direction of apartment markets. Our markets accelerating based on demographic demand or are they decelerating under the pressure of new supply. We believe that both questions can be answered with a yes. On the one hand, demographic demand is historically strong, predictably so and will be strengthened for many years to come by baby boomers, increasing their preference for rental housing.","On the other hand, all markets will be overbuilt at some point, meaning that competitive new supply will limit or even reverse rent growth. But not all markets will be overbuilt at the same time and where there is oversupply, it will have its greatest impact on properties with the highest rents. And that\u2019s why we emphasize diversification by market and by price point as the foundation of Aimco portfolio strategy. The nature of a diversified portfolio is that there are generally some markets accelerating and some decelerating. That\u2019s true for Aimco today as Keith will discuss further in his remarks.","We expect that portfolio diversification will make Aimco revenue more predictable and less volatile. Here are four headlines for the Aimco second quarter. First, property operations are on track. Same store rent for apartment home was up 5.3%, a rate of increase 100 basis points greater than in the same quarter one year ago. After increased frictional vacancy due to transferring lease expirations from our shoulder quarters to our leasing season, that have contributed about 20% increase in lease expirations in the second quarter. And after reduced utility reimbursements due to milder weather and lower energy cost, same store revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year.","These results are consistent with our plan and given outperformance in the first quarter make us confident that we will meet our same store guidance for the full year, which you will recall we increased at the end of the first quarter. I am also delighted to report that Keith and his team are on track with lease up efforts at One Canal in Boston and Indigo in Redwood City.","Second headline, redevelopment value creation continues. Current redevelopment projects are on track to create value comfortably in excess of our benchmark expectation that each dollar of redevelopment spending will become more of the $1.30 or more. Work continues on two multiyear projects in Center City, Philadelphia and construction started on the next phase of redevelopment at the Palazzo in Los Angeles. In Boston we substantially completed construction of One Canal.","Our third headline, Aimco portfolio quality reaches a new high. In portfolio management we continue to sell our lowest rated properties and invest the proceeds and properties with higher rents in better prospects. Second quarter revenue for apartment home across the entire Aimco portfolio increased by 8% year-over-year to a new record $1,900 a month. And the fourth headline, Aimco beats guidance for the second quarter and raised its guidance for the full year just as we did following the first quarter.","For these good results, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver as well as across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.","And now for more detailed report on second quarter operations, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations, Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Terry. As previously discussed, we succeeded in moving 1,200 of our lease expirations out of the softer shoulder months and into the stronger second quarter. Our strategy increased our total second quarter expirations by design by roughly 20%. This was executed so that we have greater revenue growth opportunity in the long-term. In seasonally higher demand periods that significantly improved rates understanding the frictional vacancy would increase in the short term.","Operationally, we navigated through those additional expiring leases while staying on plan. We delivered rent growth of 5.3% and revenue growth of 4.2% year-over-year. Expenses, less taxes and insurance, were up 2.3%. We feel good about our strategy and the ability to deliver our revenue commitment for the balance of the year. While we\u2019ve seen supply pressure in places like Miami, Los Angeles and to a lesser extent the Bay Area, we enjoy the benefit of a diversified portfolio from both a geographic perspective and at varying price points.","The benefit of this while some markets moderated, our second quarter results were aided by accelerating markets including Washington DC, Boston and Chicago. Our 12 target markets comprise about 90% of our same store revenues. Using blended lease rate growth for the quarter, roughly 45% of our target markets accelerated, 45% decelerated with the remainder about flat on a weighted basis.","In the second quarter of 2016, our residents gave us our 11th consecutive quarter of better than four start rating in customers\u2019 satisfaction. This contributed to our renewal rate increases of 6.2% for the quarter, some 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. We saw particular strength in Seattle, the Bay Area and Denver. The renewal rents in these markets increased between 9% and 14% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing accelerated in these successive month of the quarter. This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 4.4%.","The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Seattle, Boston, San Diego and the Bay Area, ranging between 18% and 19%. As a result of our team\u2019s heard work, our blended lease rate increases of 5.3% were 17 basis points higher than the first quarter of this year, all while maintaining a relatively flat average daily occupancy.","Turnover for the quarter was better year-over-year at 49.3%, despite the significant increase in expiring leases. Of the customers we decided to move out, 26% were for career moves, 19% did not renewed due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters, or our long-term averages.","Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the second quarter was 140,000 with a median income of 95,000. Year-over-year the median income of our new residents was up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Our 12 target markets had revenue growth, up 4.5% in the second quarter versus 4.2% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers had revenue increases from more than 8% to better than 11%. This is led by the Bay Area followed by Seattle, Denver and Atlanta.","Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from almost 5% to better than 6%, were San Diego, Boston, New York and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, Washington DC, and Philadelphia. And finally, pushing out about to at year-over-year we had, Miami. While not yet complete, our July month-to-date results have blended lease rates up 4.9%, new leases up 4% and renewals up 5.8%.","July\u2019s average daily occupancy is at 95.4% roughly equal to that of July 2015 despite having 300 more expiring leases year-over-year where intentionally moved leases from our shoulder months and into peak leasing season. And finally, August and September renewal offers went out was 6% to 8% increases. And with great thanks for our teams in the field in here in Denver for your commitment, the Aimco success, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. During the second quarter, we continue to focus our investment activities on upgrading our portfolio through redevelopment and other capital investments. We\u2019ve invested $43 million in redevelopment, $31 million of that is Park Towne Place and The Sterling in Philadelphia and an additional $12 million in several smaller projects and our redevelopment pipeline.","At Park Towne Place, we achieved stabilized occupancy at the recently completed South Tower. We\u2019re making good progress in construction on East Tower, which is now 47% leased. And with these successes, we approved spending another $41 million to redevelop the North Tower. We also continued our Phase redevelopment of The Sterling. Of the 409 completed apartment homes, 81% are leased and rents are above underwriting.","During the second quarter, Aimco approved the final phase of redevelopment of The Sterling, which includes the remaining 125 apartment homes, commercial and retail build outs and completion at the street scape. The estimated investment for this final phase is $22 million. Also, during the second quarter, Aimco approved the next phase of redevelopment of the Palazzo, a 521 home community located in the mid-Wilshire District of Los Angeles. This next phase includes the renovation of 389 apartment homes on the first three floors of the community. Construction started in June and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018.","The Palazzo is owned through a joint venture in which Aimco has approximately 53% interest with total estimated investment in this phase is $25 million, of which Aimco shares $13 million. During the second quarter, we also invested $13 million on the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. As Terry mentioned, construction is largely complete with just a finishing touches in progress. Our first residents moved in mid-May and 41% of the apartment homes are currently leased at rents above underwriting. And 100% of the commercial space at One Canal is leased by a single retail tenant who is in the process of obtaining their required permits.","In addition to One Canal, we have three other properties at varying stages of lease up, Indigo, Axiom and Vivo. At Indigo, in Redwood City, California, the developer secured the TCO for the property in late June and the first residence moved in July 1st. The property is 21% leased today at rents ahead of our underwriting. We will purchase the property upon construction completion, which we anticipate will occur by the end of the third quarter. Our lease ups of Axiom and Vivo, the properties we acquired last year in Kendall Square in Cambridge are now complete. Both properties reached 95% occupancy earlier this month with rents and lease stage both better than our initial underwriting.","On the disposition side of the business, the market remains robust. In accordance with plan, we sold two conventional properties during the second quarter for $292 million in gross proceeds. And we expect to meet our disposition guidance for the year. Revenues for apartment home for the properties sold in the second quarter averaged just over $1,500, about 20% below the average of our retained portfolio.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, John. Starting with second quarter 2016 results, at $0.50 per share, AFFO was up 9% year-over-year and $0.03 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro-forma FFO of $0.59 per share was up 5% year-over-year and was also $0.03 per share above the mid-point of guidance. Second quarter AFFO outperformance was driven by greater than planned non-core earnings including $0.01 related to a transaction that was originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, our properties at market remains deep and liquid. During the quarter, we took advantage of declining treasury rates and compressing spreads, pricing two fixed rate amortizing non-recourse property loans with two year terms. The first for $145 million, priced at a spread to treasuries of approximately 150 basis points or an all-in interest rate of 3.34%. The second for $21.5 million priced at a spread of 129 basis points or an all-in rate of 2.77%.","Additionally, we reduced our overall cost of leverage by redeeming today our 7% Series E issue of preferred stock. We are well positioned to take advantage of state\u2019s uncertain interest rate environment. If interest rates remain low, earnings will benefit as we refinance maturities with weighted average interest rates of approximately 5% at expected lower rates. If rates increase for long duration fixed rate debt with 7.8 year weighted average maturity will mitigate the financial impact and provide a hedge, should cap rates rise.","Now, looking forward to the remainder of the year. We\u2019re increasing full year pro-form FFO and AFFO guidance for the $0.02 of non-timing related second quarter outperformance, offset by $0.01 reduction due to the decision to vacate the North Tower at Park Towne Place as we accelerate its redevelopment timeline. As for our second guidance raise this year, full year AFFO and pro-forma FFO guidance is now $0.02 per share higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year. In yesterday\u2019s release, we also established third quarter AFFO guidance of $0.43 to $0.47 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.","Shifting gears to operational guidance. With second quarter results meeting our expectations and a consistent outlook for the remainder of the year, our expectation of same store revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% remains unchanged. Underpinning our guidance at the midpoint is an expectation of 5% revenue growth in the second half of 2016 with strong rent growth already embedded in our in place leases and expectations for continued above the trend demand, 5% revenue growth appears to be achievable.","We also confirmed our expectation of 1.75% to 2.25% expense growth and NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year. With yesterday\u2019s release, we also established guidance for third quarter same store NOI growth of 5.5% to 6.5% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. This is in line with expectations we have for the quarter at the start of the year.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions two per time in a queue. Laura I\u2019ll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just first question on L.A. it softened a bit this quarter, but appear to be largely occupancy driven. So I was just curious if any of that was related to the revenue optimization initiatives the moving of leases? Or if that\u2019s the effects you\u2019re feeling from new supply?","Keith Kimmel","Austin, it's Keith, I\u2019ll take it. You\u2019re spot on, on both cases actually. So, about a percent of it was associated with leases that we had moved from the shoulder months into the second quarter about 100 leases, and about a percent of this frictional vacancy. The second piece is that we are seeing some new supply in Los Angeles about 2,500 units but more particular about 600 in the mid-Wilshire District where the majority of our apartments are. So we\u2019re working through that but those are the two components.","Austin Wurschmidt","So just following up on the first one, what\u2019s your expectation then for L.A. in back half of the year. I think you have another difficult occupancy comp in the third quarter.","Keith Kimmel","So Austin, we\u2019ll continue to work through July, August and September and then we will see an acceleration as we get into the fourth quarter with the leases out.","Austin Wurschmidt","Then just second question on the Indigo project, last quarter you talked about closing that ahead of this call. I was wondering if there was anything specific as to why that was pushed back a little bit later. And then separately just on the lease up pace, I guess, what units are available. You\u2019re about 5% as of the end of 1Q, just over 20% here today. Would you expect that to accelerate, are you guys showing, actually showing available units at this point?","John Bezzant","Austin, this is John. Couple of things and relating to timing, the developer and the contractor just ran a little slower than what they initially thought they were going to for delivery. As we noted in my comments, they\u2019ve got TCO on the units of the building, or partial TCO for the finishing that to the building at the end of June. First, occupancies, first move into literally July 1st. We have today accepted about up third of the units in the building. So it's still in active construction zone. The amenities were mostly completely about a week ago but they\u2019re not all done. We\u2019re not in the leasing office yet, and so this is still a building very much under construction. And so between leasing pace and timing of closing, really this is driven by the completion of the building which we anticipate will occur again sometime before the end of the quarter, this third quarter.","Operator","And the next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Paul, you talked about the guidance assuming 5% potential revenue growth in the back half, which is acceleration from the first half, which is different than what peers are seeing. So I am wondering if you can walk through the occupancy, rent and other income assumptions embedded in that guidance?","Paul Beldin","You bet Nick, I\u2019d be happy to. As you all know, our ability to grow revenues depending upon three factors. First is as you asking the question Nick is occupancy. The second fact relates to the revenue growth that\u2019s already embedded in our rent roll today. And the third is the impact of new and renewal leases that are transacted during the second half of the year. And so as we think about occupancy growth, in the third quarter, we expect that occupancy will be fairly similar to 2015. But because of the positive impact that we expect to see from our lease expiration management, we expect a bump up in occupancy in the fourth quarter.","Then the second factor I mentioned is the growth embedded in our rent roll. Within our rent roll today we probably have about 75% to 80% of our revenue baked in for the second half of the year, and that amount that\u2019s baked in is at a rate that\u2019s right around 5%. And so then the last major component relates to the transacted rates that we expect to see for the second half of the year. And so in order to hit the midpoint of our guidance we\u2019ve had to see transacted rates probably in the mid to upper four ranges, and so based upon 5% transacted rate growth year-to-date that seems to be quite achievable.","Nick Joseph","And do you expect other income to grow at a slower pace than rental growth?","Paul Beldin","As we looked at our expectations for other income at the start of the year, we thought that other income would grow in and about the 3% range versus 4% where we were in 2015. What we see through the first half of the year is other income has grown much more slowly, I think we\u2019re up less than 100 basis points. That is largely attributable to lower utility expenses. And so while we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen for the remainder of the year, we are able to be reimburse for about 65% of our utility cost. So whether utilities are up or down, the impact on NOI is rather nominal.","Nick Joseph","And then for the second quarter you had weighted average rent increases of 5.3%. And did I hear you say that there was 100 basis points better than last year?","Paul Beldin","That\u2019s correct.","Nick Joseph","So I am wondering what maybe is driving that comp, because when I look at the same store pool for weighted average rent increases from 2Q supplemental from last year of 5.4%. So I would have thought it was 10 basis points decrease. I am wondering what\u2019s 110 basis points various between those two numbers?","Paul Beldin","There is a lot of very similar terms. So when we\u2019ve talked about that the rent increase that is the rate of increase on our in place leases during the quarter that is pre-adjustment for both the impact of other income and occupancy. So once you take into account those two factors, you get the 5.4 number that you referenced, which on an equivalent basis would be the 4.2 that we saw. But if you look at the rents, the rents are accelerating, the 100 bps.","Nick Joseph","So versus weighted average rent increase in the supplemental on page two, that\u2019s really more of a revenue number?","Paul Beldin","Let me grab my supplemental, here on page of the release?","Nick Joseph","Exactly and so this 5.3% on the second quarter, and that\u2026","Paul Beldin","There are two numbers I am catching up for you now Nick. There are two numbers that are both 5.3%. If you look at our transacted rates during the second quarter on a blended basis, those are up 5.3%. That is on the middle of the page. If you also look on the same pages on the top table, we have a line that\u2019s average rent for apartment home and the year-over-year variance there is also 5.3%. And so that might be the course of -- the cause of the confusion. And if you like to talk about it further, please give me a call and we\u2019ll work through the details.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Just two part question on Indigo. First of all, can you quantify how much it is leasing above underwriting? I think last quarter you said single digit. And then the second part is did the delay in acquiring Indigo contributes to your rate and FFO guidance? Because I think it was initially dilutive to earnings.","Terry Considine","So, John, in terms of the underwriting, yes, it remains in single digits above the rents we\u2019re achieving single-digit above the underwriting, and I\u2019ll let Paul comment on the timings it relates to.","Paul Beldin","John, you are exactly right. The delay in the acquisition of Indigo will be a net positive for Aimco, not only from a 2016 economic standpoint but more importantly from an IRR standpoint. We underwrote the project. We expect it to build in to be clearly empty on day. And so now when we take it over, it will be at least partially leased and we\u2019ll have income coming in from day one. Now unfortunately for us there is not a real significant benefit to us in 2016. We pick up probably $200,000 from this delay on a bottom line basis. So, it's not necessarily impactful for 2016 results.","John Kim","And then Terry, thanks for the headlines you gave at your prepared comments. I think one of them was your portfolio is reaching an all time high in terms of quality. I just wanted to merit that with your discussion of having a diverse portfolio. Do you want to increase your As and Bs as a percentage of your portfolio?","Terry Considine","We want to maintain a balance. We\u2019re 45% -- I guess we\u2019re about 50% aged today and that\u2019s about as high as we\u2019d like we might get over that, just based on timing but we have no appetite for grabbing the highest rent unless it's balanced elsewhere by some inhibition against competitive new supply.","John Kim","Thank you.","John Bezzant","I might jump in there John, just real quickly, this is John Bezzant, in an overall portfolio basis our rent stood at about a 113% of the market rents throughout our portfolio and that sits right in that very comfortable, just above average kind of a BB plus portfolio that we've tried to craft overall.","John Kim","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Question on merchant build opportunities, are you seeing a lot of opportunities for you but merchant build acquisition opportunities, is there anything changed in that transaction, are you seeing more opportunities to take out developers just in the last couple of months.","John Bezzant","Drew, it\u2019s John, we haven't seen a lot of, lot of market uptick in that, certainly not in the form of distress, there are plenty developers out there that are still looking for equity and for the opportunity to put deals together. But we have not seen any candidly for us in terms of an acquisition opportunity we haven't seen anything compelling come across in quite some time.","Drew Babin","Maybe accurate to say that redevelopment in your current portfolio over currently the more attractive option.","John Bezzant","Absolutely.","Drew Babin","Okay, then one question on Lincoln Place specifically, I know you gave color on mid Wiltshire, you talked in the past about Lincoln Place asset being very unique and it obviously is in the Venice market and with the amount of land that it has size of unit etcetera. Is it continuing to compete well against the new supply in Silicon Beach area from a differentiation standpoint, or do you see something change there.","Keith Kimmel","Drew this is Keith, I'll help you walk through that, thank you for your question and it\u2019s exactly what we're seeing, interestingly enough when you look at -- Vista, there's a couple thousand units, Irvine company, Lincoln Properties that are putting units in there and they're going more vertical. We continue to see occupancy north of 95% at Lincoln Place and we really attribute it to the fact that it is such a unique product, where you have open space between units, setbacks of a couple of hundred feet from the sidewalk with open drive spaces and of course the unique architecture in styling of the buildings and so. We have weathered that a little bit differently than we've seen within the market place.","Drew Babin","Thank you, that's helpful.","Keith Kimmel","In addition to that we continue to see rents continue to push higher than what we\u2019re seeing in the overall LA market.","Drew Babin","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Connor Wagner of Greenstreet Advisors.","Connor Wagner","Good morning, Keith can you confirm it was 4% new leased and 5.8% renewals in July.","Keith Kimmel","That's right, Connor.","Connor Wagner","And then you guys are typically seen an acceleration in new lease and renewal growth through the summer, but it looks like it\u2019s actually coming down from June. Do you expect that to come back in August or September or can you help us understand what's going on there.","Keith Kimmel","Connor, it is Keith, I'll take it. We definitely, we anticipate that we'll see acceleration as we work our way through the balance of the third quarter. When we look at July, July typically when we look back historically is the month in which we have the greatest amount of inventory, it's kind of our peak a peak so to see it as we navigate through it we\u2019ll build momentum coming out of it.","Connor Wagner","Okay great thank you and then for John, you said you're on track for dispositions, what are the plans for the remaining $120 million that you'll have outside we have to put into Indigo, can you use 1031 proceeds for your redevelopment opportunities.","John Bezzant","No, you can't use 1031 proceeds for, I'll let Paul speak to use of proceed, but it's all pursuant to our original budget for the year and we cover the proceeds and what we use it for.","Paul Beldin","Oh Connor I was just going to add that to fund the acquisition of Indigo we currently have set up in a 1031 exchange account about $290 million of proceeds and that will cover substantially all of our cost for the acquisition of Indigo.","Connor Wagner","Yes, I think the original guidance was $450 million in dispositions for the year, so just understanding, if you have to use those additional proceeds beyond what\u2019s going to go into Indigo, that's when you go towards redevelopment or if you guys are looking you know for a $100 million or so in acquisitions in the back half of the year.","Paul Beldin","Connor as we set up our plan for the year we purposely backend weighted an element of our disposition timing so you're likely to notice that our borrowings on our credit facility have run all the ties in what they have historically and our plan today is to the extent that we\u2019re able to execute on the remaining $150 million so dispositions, those proceeds will be used to pay down on the credit facility balance.","Connor Wagner","Great thank you, then I have one last if I may on Indigo. Have you started to lease up the penthouse yet and on a revenue basis how much will the penthouses or the larger three bedrooms be for the total property.","Paul Beldin","We have started leasing there on the penthouse levels, it's the 10th floor, there are three different towers in the building and the 10th floor of each building is our penthouse units that we have leased there. I don\u2019t have an exact number for you today of how many of the penthouses are leased but it has been a measurable part of the leasing activity to date commensurate with the overall activity in the building. As to revenue guidance to the impact if you will of the penthouses on the overall new writing it's relatively marginal. They're not a big count number in the overall scheme of things and so we're not relying on them to duce returns if you will there, kind of part of the commodity as well.","Connor Wagner","Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and our next question will come from Michael Kodesch of Cannacord.","Michael Kodesch","Hi, thanks for taking my question, just one quick one from me and I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks but, I was wondering if you guys had an update to your historic tax credits and other tax benefits guidance. I think at your initial full year guidance you guys were expecting about 19 million or so in total at the midpoint. Any update to that or you know you guys are kind of tracking around that as well.","Paul Beldin","Yes, Michael thank you for the question, this is Paul. We are tracking, I think there's a couple of different numbers, the $19 million number I believe is the impact of the amortization of our deferred tax credit revenue and we're on track to hit that number but our historic tax benefits in particular we provided a range of I believe 9 to 11 million and right now we're tracking to be within that range. I would point out that with the North Tower acceleration of Park Town Place we do expect to earn historic tax credits on that project however that won't impact our 2016 results that'll be actually be a 2017 event for us.","Michael Kodesch","Great, thanks, I was just talking about the combination of both, the historic credit benefits and the other tax benefits but it sounds like you guys are kind of still in that range, so.","Paul Beldin","Yes, we're within our guidance range on those.","Michael Kodesch","Great, thanks.","Operator","And this concludes our question and answer session, I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well thank you Lauren, thanks to all of you for your interest in AIMCO, please contact Lynn Stanfield, Paul Beldin or me if you have any question and we wish you a good weekend, thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded, thank you for attending today's presentation, you may now disconnect."],"2145":["Apartment Investment & Management Company (NYSE:AIV) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2017  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Terry Considine - Chairman and CEO","Keith Kimmel - EVP, Property Operations","John Bezzant - EVP and Chief Investment Officer","Paul Beldin - EVP and CFO","Patti Fielding - EVP and Treasurer","Lisa Cohn - EVP, General Counsel and Secretary","Analysts","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Pete Peikidis - Zelman & Associates","Conor Wagner - Green Street Advisors","Richard Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Buck Horne - Raymond James","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Aimco Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2017 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","And I'll now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Here is the headline; Aimco Reports Strong Results. This year has had its challenges, including hurricanes, Airbnb and new supply competing with some of our higher rent properties. But Aimco strategy contemplates that there will always be challenges and prepares for such by emphasizing portfolio diversification, both geographic and across price points, redevelopment, overdevelopment with the flexibility of redevelopment to adjust the pace of activity to track changing market conditions, and customer focus, providing greater retention, lower costs and enhanced pricing power.","Here are a few proofs; year-to-date FFO per share is up 6%. Year-to-date AFFO per share, our preferred measure for current period profitability, is up 7%. In the third quarter, same store net operating income was up 4.5% year-over-year, adding $0.03 per share to net operating income. Our portfolio outside of same store, about 30% of our business, added $0.04 per share to net operating income from the lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities, before $0.02 per share subtraction from properties sold to fund these activities. And parenthetically I know, this ignores the $0.03 per share increase in net operating income from the Palazzo reacquisition, because that was roughly offset by interest expense.","Our customer and portfolio quality metrics continue their steady improvement. Median income for new customers was $107,000, up 7% and average monthly revenue per apartment home was $2,075, up 6%.","Looking ahead, we are busy now with plans and budgets for next year. Paul will provide detailed guidance for 2018 on our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. The general assumptions for our planning are, first, the economy will continue steady growth. Second, demographics will support continued solid demand for our apartments. Third, competition from new supply will continue, although there will be rotation as to which submarkets are exposed. And fourth, financial flexibility and safety will be rewarded, if there is unexpected distress in capital markets.","We plan to stick to our strategy of customer selection and customer satisfaction, leading to high customer retention. With constant focus on fine-tuning property operations, to increase effectiveness and to reduce costs. With low risk accretive redevelopments and limited developments, where there are special circumstances. Disciplined capital allocation based on pair trades, a strong balance sheet with abundant liquidity and limited exposure to capital markets, and an intentional team culture, emphasizing collaboration and performance.","For the good results of this quarter, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver, as well as across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.","And now for a more detailed report on the third quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Terry. I am pleased to report that we had a solid third quarter in operations, with strong performances in stable markets such as San Diego and Chicago. Offsetting challenges with competitive new supply in particular markets such as Philadelphia and Miami.","Same store revenues were up 2.8%. Expenses were down 1.1% and net operating income was up 4.5%. Our residents continue to reward us with high marks, as they gave us better than a four star rating in customer satisfaction for the 16th consecutive quarter, with a 4.24 out of a possible five stars, matching our record for the second consecutive quarter. This contributed to our turnover for the quarter being at 44.4%, our lowest turnover result since the second quarter of 2012, with the most transactions of the year.","This allowed us to keep a higher percentage of our most valued customers, at higher rates and reduced costs for preparing additional apartments for rent. Average daily occupancy finished at 96% for the quarter, matching our highest occupancy for any third quarter since 2010, 20 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016 and 10 basis points sequentially. Move out reasons for the quarter are unchanged versus recent results are on [ph] long term averages.","Looking at rates which transacted in the quarter; blended lease rates were up 3%, with renewal rates having solid increases of 4.5%. We saw particular strength in Denver, Seattle, San Diego and Chicago. Renewal rents in these markets increased more than 5% compared to the expiring leases. For those leases expired and were not renewed, our new leases increased 1.4% versus the prior lease. We saw particular improvements in San Diego, Seattle and Boston, renewal leases had premiums from better than 3% to 7%.","Turning to the third quarter same store revenue growth; our top performers had revenue increases from nearly 4%, better than 5% for the quarter. This was led by Atlanta, followed by Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Our steady performance which had revenue growth from 2% to 3%, were Denver, Boston, Miami, the Bay Area and Washington D.C., and with revenue growth between positive and negative 1%, we had New York and Philadelphia.","Finally, in looking at our early fourth quarter results, with one week to go to close October. Our preliminary blended lease rates are up roughly 2%, with renewals up 4.6% and new leases down about 1%, with an accelerated average daily occupancy of 96.2%, as we shift our focus to higher occupancy for the winter months. In November and December, renewal offers went out with 4% to 6% increases.","And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco success, I will turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thanks Keith. You have just a good report at our same store portfolio and operations. I'd like to spend some time talking about our second important line of business, redevelopment and development.","We invested $33 million during the third quarter, and leased almost 300 apartment homes, a third of those at Park Towne Place. At Park Towne, we completed the construction on the third tower, which was nearly 70% leased at completion. That tower is 77% leased today, at rates consistent with underwriting. We expect this tower to be over 90% leased by year end, joining the other two redeveloped towers that are already occupancy stabilized.","In the past three years, Aimco has leased more than 1,100 redeveloped apartment homes in Center City, Philadelphia. Based on these successful results, we decided to proceed with a $40 million redevelopment of the fourth and final tower, Park Towne Place. New leasing is underway, and construction is scheduled to commence in December.","We made a second investment decision this quarter with respect to East Point. In 2014, we acquired this property, a C property in Boulder, Colorado. It's located two miles from the new Google campus, and across the street from Ball Aerospace\u2019s Technology Campus and Foothills Hospital.","Building in Boulder is highly regulated, new supply is limited, notwithstanding higher enrollment at the University of Colorado and increased employment, averaging nearly 5,000 annually since 2010.","Since 2015, three institutional grade apartment complexes have been constructed in the Boulder submarket. Two in the gun barrel neighborhood, an area five miles northeast of downtown, where light industrial uses are more typical than residential. And only one in downtown Boulder proper, with only 26 units.","Over time, more will be built, but Boulder will remain a market with high demand and significant barriers to competitive new supply. Over the past two years, Aimco has planned and entitled a new $170 million, 226 apartment home community to be known as Parc Mosaic. The de-leasing of Eastpointe is now underway and construction of Parc Mosaic is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter. Our investment underwriting includes all costs, including the cost of acquiring the property. Our expected return and value creation are consistent with our objective to earn free cash flow, internal rate of returns, risk premium of 150 to 250 basis points, when compared to acquisition of a stabilized property.","And one of the things we like about redevelopment is the flexibility it affords us to just scope and timing if spending, to align with changing market conditions.","During the quarter, we leased 83 redeveloped homes at Yorktown and Calhoun. And while we were satisfied with pricing, we were not satisfied with pace. Given the observed new supply and typically softer seasonal demand, we are pausing these projects for the winter.","By contrast, we are pleased with both rate and pace at Saybrook Pointe; a B property located in San Jose, California, where we leased 66 redeveloped homes this quarter, and continue full speed ahead. Looking forward, we were planning projects at Mariners Cove in San Diego and other properties being redeveloped to a B price point.","On the transactions front, the property sales needed to fund the Palazzo pair trade are on-track, with the majority of closings expected in mid to late December.","And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks John. Aimco's balance sheet remains healthy, with abundant liquidity, flexibility and limited exposure of the capital markets. In the third quarter, we continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment, enclosed or rate locked five non-recourse, fixed rate property loans, totaling $297 million. On a weighted average basis, these loans have a term of 9.6 years and an interest rate of 3.43%, a spread of 125 basis points over the corresponding treasury rates at the time of pricing.","The net effect of our year-to-date property debt refinancing activities has been to lower our weighted average fixed interest rates by almost 10 basis points to 4.75%, generating prospective annual interest savings of approximately $3 million per year.","Aimco's leverage target remains unchanged at $3.8 billion. We are temporarily above target, due to the Palazzo reacquisition. Upon completion of the fourth quarter property sales that John outlined, we expect to return to the targeted leverage level. Wrapping up the balance sheet, our pool of unencumbered assets is valued today at $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% from the beginning of the year.","Moving on to third quarter results; AFFO at $0.54 per share and pro forma FFO of $0.63 per share were up $0.08 and $0.09 respectively and notwithstanding $0.01 of hurricane costs, $0.02 and $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our respective guidance ranges, with our performance driven by a slight fee [ph] across a number of categories. These results contributed to year-to-date FFO per share up 6% and AFFO per share up 7%.","Now turning to guidance; with the majority of 2017 in the rearview mirror, we are maintaining the midpoints of our AFFO and FFO guidance, while narrowing their ranges to be between $2.10 and $2.14 for AFFO and between $2.42 and $2.46 for FFO. We expect the $0.01 of third quarter FFO outperformance will be offset by dilution, resulting from de-leasing East Pointe and the fourth tower at Park Towne, in anticipation of the redevelopment next year.","We have also maintained the midpoints of our full year same store operating results. For the year, we expect to transact a little over 24,000 leases. We have already completed about 23,000; 20,000 for occupancy in January through September, and another 3,000, already executed for occupancy in the fourth quarter, leaving only about 1,200 or roughly 5% of our full year activity still to go. The blended lease rent increases achieved in all 23,000 leases completed year-to-date is 2.7%. Through September, year-to-date average daily occupancy is just below 96%. With October occupancy expected to be 96.2%, year-to-date average daily occupancy will increase to 96%.","All else equal, fourth quarter average daily occupancy and expected range of 96.2 to 96.4 will result in revenue growth of approximately in the midpoint of our revenue guidance.","Now inherent within the midpoint achievement, is sequential revenue growth acceleration of approximately 40 basis points. We expect the majority of acceleration will be achieved by sequential average daily occupancy improvement. Additionally, we are seeing improvement in year-over-year blended lease rate growth. During the first three quarters of 2017, our blended lease rate achievement was lower year-over-year. However, it is worth noting in the fourth quarter, we expect that trend to reverse.","While over 70% of our fourth quarter leasing activity complete, we have achieved a blended rate increase of 2.7%, consistent with our blended rate increases during the first nine months of the year, and over 100 basis points ahead of last year.","Finally, in yesterday's release, we said guidance for fourth quarter FFO per share of $0.54 to $0.58 per share, and FFO per share of $0.60 to $0.64.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I will turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. John, you mentioned that your underwriting included the initial cost of acquiring East Pointe. I was just curious if that $170 million also includes the acquisition costs? And then, can you also give us a sense in Denver in particular, where cap rates are today for higher end communities in high quality submarkets?","John Bezzant","Sure. I am going to start with the second one, and then I am going to pass you to Patti Fielding, whose team did the underwriting on the Parc Mosaic project, and [indiscernible] to that with more specificity.","Denver cap rates are ranging in a tight submarket, and you will see them in the fours and in the low fours, including in Boulder. There were a couple of sales that took place last year in Boulder, that were in the 3s. And so there are institutional cap rates, right around the 4 range and even below 4, and you will see that range all the way up into the B and C categories into the 6s.","Patti, would you like to address the Parc Mosaic?","Patti Fielding","Sure. I mean, the answer is yes. It did include the land costs in the $170 million.","Austin Wurschmidt","Which was around $19 million as your basis in that today?","John Bezzant","Yeah Austin. The original all-in basis was a little over $18 million, and so there is roughly $3 million or so allocated to the building that has been fully depreciated and the value of which was recouped during our operating period from 2014 through this year.","Patti Fielding","Right. So $15.3 million was loaded into the model.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for the clarification there. And then, just as far as the expense cuts and modest growth that you guys have experienced now for some time, just curious if those are part of a broader internal opportunity and what's kind of left to cut at this point, or has any of it been a little more reactive and related to performance across the portfolio?","Keith Kimmel","Austin, this is Keith. I will help you through that. Really, when you talk about expense cuts, I would recategorize them. I would categorize them as our focus about being innovative and centralization and being more efficient around how we do things. In particular, when we think about payroll, there is a lot of different work that happens on-site, that is in fractional types of activities. And with our shared service center here in Denver, we have found the opportunity to take that work, centralize it, become more efficient with it, and additionally adding innovation around technologies and other things.","So we continue to spend more on repairs and maintenance and asset preservation and taking care of our communities, contract services, all those types of things. But it's areas in which we find ways to be more innovative, that we believe is really the difference.","Austin Wurschmidt","Anything in particular you can point to, that you have rolled out in certain submarkets, but haven't rolled across the entire portfolio that could continue to generate some savings moving forward?","Keith Kimmel","Austin, appreciate the question. I don't want to get into the secret sauce, so to speak here. But what I would say is, is we believe there is still opportunities.","Austin Wurschmidt","Fair enough. Thanks for the time.","Operator","And the next question today comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Going back to Austin's question, for the Boulder asset; how did you weigh a redevelopment of the property versus de-leasing and rebuilding new? And then what's the targeted underwritten stabilized yield on the newbuilds?","Keith Kimmel","Well Nick, this property was built in the late 60s, if I remember correctly, the original East Pointe, and it was candidly tired, as it has been owned in a family trust for decades before we bought it. We bought it seeing an opportunity there, primarily in the land site, and the location within Boulder. We did assess a redevelopment of the site, versus a new development of the site, and determine that the best -- using the best return, was through doing a full redevelopment, there is just a lot of investors, a lot of deferred maintenance. It was an old property and it was tired.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. What's the targeted yield on the development?","Keith Kimmel","Targeted yield is in the mid 5s.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Then Terry you mentioned in your prepared remarks, a rotation of supply next year. So what are you expecting across your markets, in terms of 2018 supply versus 2017 supply and in terms of the expectation within markets, which markets are you expect to compete with more supply next year, and which will have favorable comps?","Terry Considine","Nick, we will give you a full update of that in January. But today, we want to focus on the third quarter and the completion of 2017. But what I did say is that, as we plan for next year, we are in the camp that thinks that competitive new supply continues, but we think it will be in different places.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then maybe just finally on the asset sales, you mentioned expecting mid to late December for many of the sales; has any of the prices changed, relative to your initial expectations, or has the timing changed at all?","Terry Considine","No, no. Some of these have been under contract for nearly a year. Others are newer ones that have come in and are under contract now. But no, they are kind of right on top of where we expected them to be.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just hoping you could delve into a couple of your markets, LA and DC and kind of how you are seeing trends, as we think about 2018, with new supply obviously being an issue downtown and having previously affected some of your Mid-Wilshire properties there. In DC, a market that everybody seems to be a little bit worried about, going into 2018, if you could just give us your latest thoughts on those two?","Keith Kimmel","Hey Juan, it's Keith. I will walk through both of those for you. I will start with DC; when we look at DC, our expectations in the beginning of the year was predicated on over the previous number of quarters, where kind of a steady progression of building of rates coming back and occupancy. It has gotten a little sluggish over the third quarter, and so, whether that's a reflection of government jobs or second generations of different lease-ups or a variety of things, it has been a little bit more sluggish.","But what I point out in our particular cases is that, having occupancy at 96%, we have really put a lot of emphasis on retaining our best customers, and those are our existing ones. Our turnover in DC was at 38% for the quarter, and we were getting 4% in renewals. So at the end of the day, while there is some sluggishness, we still feel good about DC and where it looks going forward.","In Los Angeles, Los Angeles has -- obviously it's a big place, and there is all kinds of submarkets and micromarkets within it. At the end of the day, we know that there is more supply in Staples and other places, but we believe we have some of the best located assets within Mid-Wilshire and throughout the entire Los Angeles portfolio. And so, we have seen improvements there, we have seen Los Angeles coming strong in the third quarter here for us, and we continue to feel good about our position there.","Terry Considine","And Juan, if I could just add a commentary on the supply side of the question, in DC in particular, if you look at third party forecasts, they do expect a significant increase in DC supply. But that's mainly within the district itself. And so we only have a single asset in the district. It's a rather small asset at the A price point, and that property will be affected candidly. But the vast majority of our DC portfolio is located in suburban Virginia, and other suburban areas, and so we feel comfortable at the price points at which those properties operate, that they will be fairly well inflated.","Juan Sanabria","And then if you could speak to separately on [indiscernible] acquisition environment, anything you are looking at for kind of bigger capital spend? I know you have talked about staff in Miami and maybe some opportunities in Manhattan with the Second Avenue Subway and just kind of how you are seeing potential new spend, whether acquisitions are larger redevelopment projects?","John Bezzant","Hey Juan, this is John. I would say that, on the acquisition front, we continue to look as we have for many years. We underwrite a fair number of deals. We execute on very few of those deals, and as you are fully aware, we have not bought any deals since Indigo, and committed to that one two years ago. So we are, I would say, cautious, but we continue to exercise our pair trade discipline, which is what makes the caution, creates the caution and creates the discipline for us.","In terms of Miami, the Yacht Club Deal, that is a prospective development deal that continues to work its way through our planning cycle, and we are continuing to underwrite and analyze that one. We don't have any big pending announcement there, in terms of anything in the immediate future. New York is really the same story. We have a handful of opportunities around the country, on the, what I would call, the development side of the business, that we plan on looking at. And when the numbers make sense and the project is appropriately planned, as Parc Mosaic is, we will [indiscernible].","Juan Sanabria","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Pete Peikidis of Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.","Pete Peikidis","Hey, thanks for the time today. So the first question I had here, goes back to your prepared remarks, where you expect the reacceleration, blended rents here through the quarter, the fourth quarter. If you could just speak to some -- what's driving that in terms of specific markets?","Paul Beldin","Well Pete, this is Paul. I will speak to it, related to the portfolio as a whole, because that's really how we manage the business. And so, as a portfolio, we ended the third quarter with average daily occupancy of 96%. We are up to 96.2% already forecast for October. That's an acceleration of 10 basis points over the prior year, and so we are off to a good start to driving higher levels of occupancy. Additionally, we will see our occupancy lifted slightly by our lease expirations. We have about 200 fewer lease expirations in the fourth quarter of this year than last year. And then the second piece of the acceleration expectation, is really driven by what has happened with rate.","If you compare our blended lease rates by quarter, for the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016, you would have seen there is a deceleration on the growth. However, if you look at it from the fourth quarter of 2017, our growth rate -- excuse me, I misspoke, fourth quarter of 2016, for this population was about 1.6%. We are about 70% done with our fourth quarter leasing activity this year, and we are at 2.7%. So feel pretty confident that we are going to end up ahead of last year.","Pete Peikidis","Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then lastly here on just -- if I could just touch on Boston. Seems like it has been a solid performance year-to-date, but it has softened a bit. In particular to counter the competitive supply that is expected here in the near term, especially in the urban submarkets like Cambridge and City Center there, through the remainder of the year, and into early 2018. Can you just speak to what you are seeing here in October and sort of how you position that portfolio and maybe speak to some more of the suburban versus urban kind of dynamic there?","Keith Kimmel","Pete, it's Keith. I will take it for you. When we think about the urban, first and foremost really, what we have there is, we have two buildings in Cambridge and then of course, on Canal. So those buildings are not within our same store focus, and so I would categorize those slightly different. The rest of our portfolio of course is in suburban Boston and outside. So those buildings, we don't feel have the same impact or pressures from new supply that's going to be in the city, and while it was a little bit softer than where it was a year ago, it's almost nearly 96% occupied, and we feel quite good about our position there.","Pete Peikidis","All right. Great. That's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Today's next question comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. Could you speak to the other income boost in the quarter and if there is any particular markets that was driving that?","Paul Beldin","Hey Conor, this is Paul. Thanks for the question on other income. Other income, as you know, comprises roughly about 10% of our total revenue. On a year-to-date basis, that has grown at a level that's lower than what our rental rate achievement has been, so it has been over the drag on our overall revenue number. And really, the volatility within that numbers is, in most cases, driven by utility reimbursements. As you all know, that we have about two thirds of our utility costs are reimbursed by our residents. And so as utility costs move up and down, so do our reimbursement amounts.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. And then Lisa, can you give us an update on the Airbnb suit please?","Lisa Cohn","Sure. Thanks for the question Conor. As you all probably saw, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction a couple of weeks ago, maybe last week, I have lost track of time. And that's proceeding through the court. Probably a hearing on that in early December or maybe early January. We continue to really focus on-site to do our most important job, which is selecting our neighbors for our residents, and ensuring that we create a community that has longevity and the retention we seek for our residents and delivers great customer service. So we have put in place a number of measures on Keith's team to eliminate this trespassing, which you know, we oppose strongly.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. And then, do you guys have any sense of, has Airbnb, at least on the rate side or the rent side, has that been a boost in any of your communities? Just in terms of people willing to pay more in rent, because they plan on essentially wholesaling your unit?","Lisa Cohn","Conor, I think we see it the other way. And that is we see it as a negative financial impact, because of the detriment it creates inside the communities.","Conor Wagner","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks very much. Paul, first question for you. You back into G&A for the full year, it's a big $3 million type jump in the fourth quarter. Can you explain why that's the case?","Paul Beldin","Yeah. Always within the yearend G&A, there is a little bit of volatility between the quarters. There is not a real consistent run rate. And so on a year-to-date basis, we are running behind what a pro-rata recognition of our G&A costs would be. And so a little bit on a year-to-date basis, we have benefited from that timing of G&A, but we expect it to catch up here in the fourth quarter.","Richard Anderson","Is there a potential source of upside in the fourth quarter? Somehow it doesn't happen the way you plan?","Paul Beldin","Well if the things that we think will happen, don't happen; yes, it would be an upside.","Richard Anderson","Thank you for that statement of the obvious. And then, a bigger picture question maybe for Terry. A lot of growth and maturity in the single family rental business, and I predict, you would probably say it's not impacting lost tenants from your portfolio, but you can confirm or deny if you like. But I am wondering if you think about, five, 10 years from now, just to add a little bit of more of a flavorful question on the Friday. Do you think that there is a chance that multifamily and single family could ultimately come together, and have a wider net of potential business, by bringing the two sort of businesses together? Just out of curiosity, what do you think about that, since Ernie is now in that business?","Terry Considine","Rich, with your usual insights, you have asked a really good question. And it would be incorrect to say that Ernie is a trojan horse and that we are planning this convergence. He is doing quite well independently, and we keep in touch. He is a dear friend and doing a great job there. But I do think that they can and will overlap, when they serve the same customer. And so there is a focus on the division between these two categories, based on the physical structure. But I think the more fundamental difference is the customers they serve.","Now on the multifamily side, we serve -- about half of our customers are single occupants. And so they are not necessarily attracted to a suburban home with a yard and a swing set.","On some of our customers though, I might well want to have a different configuration, a single story configuration. But all of them are going to have their third party management. I think that will end up being the distinctive factor, is that whether you live in a one story structure or a multiple unit structure, if you are on the -- what we now think of as the multifamily side, you will be getting the very fine management service that Keys [ph] is so well known for. And if you are in the -- what's now known as single family rental, you are going to have to mow your own lawn or arrange for it to be done. So it's going to be that division. And I think you will see some blending, and I think you will see an instance of it in the Aimco portfolio, when we add another year or so. I think its 15 single family structures to our Preserve at Marin project.","Richard Anderson","Okay. So maybe some of you in that room can mow some lawns in your retirement someday?","Terry Considine","We will keep them in shape.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Terry Considine","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Buck Horne","Hey, good afternoon. I just have one quick one for Paul. Just trying to understand the same store expense guidance a little bit better. So you are trending up 0.3% year-to-date, but looking for full year expenses to go up to, I guess, midpoint is 1.1%. So is that a function of the de-leasing of those properties you were talking about in the fourth quarter? Is there something that catches up on the expense side in the fourth quarter?","Terry Considine","Buck, thank you for your questions. Actually, just a question of a tough comp. If you go back to our fourth quarter last year, we would have talked about some real estate tax appeals that came through, as well as much lower than typical insurance costs. And so the -- basically the comp against those two numbers, create a large increase in Q4 operating expenses. And so that gets us from the 30 basis point year-to-date expense growth to the 1.1 that we expect at the midpoint.","Buck Horne","Okay. Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well thank you Rocco and thank you all of you for your interest in Aimco. I want to wish everyone a happy Halloween and look forward to see many of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you very much.","Operator","And thank you sir. Today's conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"1979":["Apartment Investment & Management (NYSE:AIV) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February  8, 2013  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Lisa R.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you. Good day, everyone. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2013 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of property operations; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO. We are available to answer questions at the conclusion of our remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. This is a time when we can review what was accomplished last year and preview our plans for the coming year.","Looking back, in property operations, Keith's team did a great job at attracting, satisfying and retaining customers while also controlling costs. They increased Conventional Same Store net operating income by 6.5% year-over-year, 25 basis points above the midpoint of earnings guidance. They also improved Conventional Same Store net operating income margin by 130 basis points to more than 65%, an Aimco record.","In portfolio management, John, Lisa and their teams worked together to improve investment quality and to simplify Aimco's business. Their disciplined pruning of weaker properties contributed to the increase of average revenue per apartment home to more than $1,360, up 8% year-over-year. They also continued the wind-down of our Affordable business and have sold more than 80 Affordable properties in the past 2 years. The remaining Affordable portfolio is less than 8% of our investment total.","In addition, they sold our asset management business and further simplified Aimco by greatly reducing number of properties owned with outside partners. In redevelopment, Dan and his team invested $100 million in 10 well-located, highly accretive redevelopment. On the balance sheet, Ernie, Patti and their teams managed effectively Aimco's well-lettered maturities of low-risk property debt. In particular, Patti and her team secured $190 million FHA-insured loan to fund the Lincoln Place redevelopment at an all-in interest rate of 2.73% for the next 42 years. Ernie and Lisa worked together to issue equity, using the proceeds to redeem $600 million of preferred stock and lower our leverage-to-EBITDA ratio by 2 full turns. The entire Aimco team remained focused on cost control and continued to reduce offsite cost below peer averages, for example, as a percent of property revenues.","In sum, we got a lot done, and it showed in the bottom line where pro forma FFO was up by 12% per share. AFFO was up by 31% per share, and the Aimco Board of Directors increased the dividend in May and again, last week. The 2013 dividend per share is double the 2011 rate, all while maintaining a payout ratio about   60% and generating a high level of retained earnings. We expect 2013 to be another good year for our business, and we plan to stay on course.","In property operations, we expect some acceleration in revenue growth from our portfolio, well diversified across both markets and price points. We expect continued cost discipline, improved customer satisfaction and increased investment in property upgrades. In portfolio management, we plan to continue selling affordable and our lowest-rated conventional properties, with proceeds reinvested through redevelopment in tax-efficient fair trades and higher-quality, higher-growth properties. We expect income growth and debt reduction, funded by retained earnings, to take us by year-end near our leverage target of 7:1.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel for a report on property operations. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. We feel very good about our 2012 results. Our on-site teams executed our plan with laser-focus on customer service. We were rewarded with continued low turnover and renewal rent increases of 5.5%. Of those leases that expired and were not renewed, new leases were signed at rates that were, on average, 3.2% higher than the expiring leases. As a result of our team's hard work, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.2% for the year, creating a book of business that will earn in over the course of 2013.","Our operations team also continued to find innovative and sustainable ways of controlling costs and continually increasing the efficiencies with which we operate, but never at the expense of asset quality or customer service. With this solid execution, our revenue growth accelerated in each quarter of 2012.  For the fourth quarter, Conventional Same Store revenue was up 5.1% year-over-year, 4.7% for the full year and up 0.9% compared to the third quarter. Blended lease rates during the fourth quarter were up 2.6%, with new leases up 0.4% and renewals up 5.1%.","Looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up 2\/3 of our revenue. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from well over 7% to nearly 11% for the quarter. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami and Denver. Our steady performance for the quarter, with midrange growth from about 4% to over 5%, were Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. And rounding out the 10 largest markets, we had San Diego and Orange County, who has leveled off some, particularly in the Irvine and Costa Mesa area, as absorption catches up to the latest round of new supply.","As we look ahead, we're building upon our 2012 successes with a solid January, establishing an expectation of a strong 2013. January blended lease rates were up 3.8%, with new lease rates up 2.1% and renewals up 5.3%. January's average daily occupancy was 95.3%, on plan and consistent with the fourth quarter. February and March renewal offers went out with a 5% to 5% -- 7% increases.","And with great thanks to our teams in the field here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, Keith. I'll spend a few moments detailing our outperformance to the midpoint of guidance from the fourth quarter and then discuss some highlights around our guidance for 2013, as detailed on Pages 6 to 8 of our earnings release.","We had a $0.02 favorable variance to the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, which is made up of the following items. Nonrecurring revenues came in higher, as did nonrecurring expenses supporting that activity. The net impact of that outperformance was $0.01. We recognized a $4 million recovery of a note receivable related to our investment in Devco. We had written down this note both in 2008 and 2009 based on our estimate of the value of the collateral underlying that note. Due to some improvement in land values in Southern California, we determined it appropriate to write off the note this quarter. The note is held on our TRFs, so the net recovery is $2.4 million or about $0.015. Superstorm Sandy had a net impact to us of about $300,000. Our current estimate for losses is $2.6 million, and we anticipate an insurance recovery of $2.3 million. As we continue to reduce our offsite costs, we incurred about $0.005 of severance charges in the fourth quarter. In total, these items net to the $0.02 outperformance.","Turning to 2013, we expect full year FFO in the range of $1.92 to $2.08 per share, which, at the midpoint, is up about 9% compared to 2012. With setting guidance range for 2013, we have assumed historical utility usage in our property operations guidance and a more typical cost associated with weather events in our casualty loss expense line item. If we are fortunate enough to have a weather year similar to 2012, our FFO could be higher by almost $0.04 per share.","AFFO is anticipated to be up about $0.18 per share at the midpoint or 14%. As you can see in our walk and as we have previously discussed, our recurring capital replacement spending is coming down, first, because we have fewer units, and second, because we are using longer-use products, such as simulated wood flooring. We have chosen to invest these savings and more in the upgrade of our Park Towne property in Philadelphia.","Regarding operations, revenue growth is anticipated between 4.25% and 5.25%. Earn-in from 2012 leasing activity is approximately 2.1%. The remainder of our anticipated revenue growth will come mostly from 2013 leasing activity, where we expect blended new and renewal lease rates similar to what we achieved in 2012 and improvements in other income, which makes up about 11% of our total property revenues.","Our expense guidance assumes increases in utilities, property taxes and insurance. These 3 items represent about half of our property-level expenses. We expect each to grow between 5% and 8% in 2013. We expect the remainder of our property expenses to remain somewhat flat from 2012.","Regarding nonrecurring revenues, you'll note in our outlook page that we are projecting $8 million to $12 million of nonrecurring revenues for 2013. All but $500,000 of that amount is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter. About half of the nonrecurring revenues represent the syndication of a portion of the historic tax credits associated with the Lincoln Place. We are also working to secure historic tax credits at other of our redevelopment projects, but have not included those in our guidance. The remainder of the nonrecurring revenues represent fees earned from the disposition of Affordable assets.","Certain of these revenues are taxable as the activity is completed in our TRFs. The $8 million to $12 million of nonrecurring revenues are expected to generate tax expense in the fourth quarter of approximately $3 million. For the first 3 quarters of 2013, we anticipate a tax benefit, in total, of about $1 million. So for the year, we are projecting tax expense of $2 million. Therefore, for the year, we expect nonrecurring income after tax to contribute about $0.05 per share.","Finally on the balance sheet, scheduled amortization totals $81 million in 2013, which we expect to fund through retained earnings. Our 2013 property debt maturities totaled $172 million or about 4% of our debt. Of that amount, we will look to refinance 4 loans representing $54 million. The remainder will be repaid in connection with the planned sale of the associated property or will be paid off at maturity as we look to grow our unencumbered pool from about $68 million of assets at year-end to about $180 million by the end of 2013. So far this year, we've unencumbered about $88 million, leaving us with about $24 million to go. About 55% of our redevelopment spend will be funded through committed loans, with the remaining funded through proceeds from property sales. Our earnings expectations and balance sheet activities keep us on the path we have discussed previously of reaching, by early 2014, our 7x target of debt and preferred to EBITDA.","With those items in mind, our walk from fourth quarter 2012 results to the midpoint of our first quarter 2013 is as follows: a decrease in operations of about $0.02 due mainly to the seasonal increase in utility costs from fourth quarter, offset some by continued sequential revenue growth; a budgeted increase in casualty loss of $0.01; a decrease in nonrecurring items of $0.06 net, which includes our fees earned from Affordable sales in the fourth quarter in the aforementioned Devco note recovery; a decrease in tax benefit of about $0.01; and dilution from fourth quarter 2012 asset sales of about $0.01. This $0.11 decrease in FFO is offset by lower offsite costs, lower severance costs and no further anticipated Sandy costs.","Later this afternoon, we'll post a walk on our website for you detailing those items. Also anticipating some questions, our $400 million redev program begun last year is well underway. On balance, higher than underwritten rent growth largely offset some unbudgeted cost for increased scope and delays.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jana Galan of Bank of America.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Keith, you mentioned in your comments that you expect rent growth to be similar to 2012 levels. Are you expecting roughly the same performance from each market? Or are you seeing an acceleration in certain markets and deceleration in others?","Keith M. Kimmel","Jana, this is Keith. We have an expectation that there will be some acceleration and some that will hold the line within our assumptions for our guidance in 2013. One -- a couple that I just pointed out that stand out, the Bay Area is one that has been of question about whether or not you can continue to have a strong growth, and I would tell you it's in our upper 1\/3 of our guidance is that we anticipate having a strong performance there, as well as Miami and Denver kind of a standout to the top 1\/3.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And can you share any comments on the B price points versus A price points within your portfolio?","Keith M. Kimmel","Certainly, Jana. The As and Bs have been really almost on top of each other, most recently. We use new lease rates as a barometer for that. They've been quite tight. The Cs have been a laggard.","Operator","And our next question is from Eric Wolfe of Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Actually, I just wanted to follow up on Jana's first question there regarding your assumption of similar rent growth in 2013 versus 2012. If you could, could you just tell us sort of what gives you confidence in that assumption, especially when the rest of your peers are seemingly seeing slower growth this year?","Ernest M. Freedman","Eric, this is Ernie. I'll take a stab at that and pass it over to Keith to talk to some of the details. Just looking at our portfolio, in 2012, we had blended lease growth of 4.2%. That would give us an opportunity to earn in at about 2.1%, and we are expecting to see similar type activity in 2012. We saw some upside also in other income and then, specifically within our guidance, Eric, we're calling for occupancy to be flat. So we've given a range that will keep occupancy flat. So each of the items, it really puts us pretty much right on top of our numbers between 2012 and 2013. In 2012, we had revenue growth of 4.7%. At the midpoint of our guidance range for 2013, we're at 4.75%. Of course, different markets are behaving differently, and Keith gave a little bit of color as to -- where some are going to decelerate, some are accelerating as well. But overall, we see a very similar year with our portfolio mainly at that average BB+ price point, very geographically diversified, probably a little bit more than our peers. So I can see a year that's going to be very similar in '13 to '12, at least, is where we stand today.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. So I guess, from your perspective, it's a little bit market mix, but really, I guess, just the price point. I'm just doing a bottoms-up analysis of your portfolio. What leads you to believe that you'll be around the same rent growth? I mean that's -- I guess, the answer to it, why other peers have been seeing slowing growth but you would be seeing sort of stable?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, what I would -- it's hard for me to compare to what other peers are doing, Eric. You guys spend a lot of time doing that. But for us, we've seen a nice acceleration of our revenues during 2012, and it gives us an opportunity to perform about at the same levels in 2013. So we feel pretty good about our opportunities to deliver those results for our shareholders.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then, in the fourth quarter, you saw -- I guess, it looks like some outsized increases in your other income. Is that the result of new initiatives or timing? And also, how would you expect that to trend in 2013?","Ernest M. Freedman","Eric, what I'd say with other income is that we probably won't have as strong a growth in other income in 2013 versus 2012. But we will still be stronger than our expected revenue growth in terms of what we're going to see our rate growth is what we're going to do. In the fourth quarter, a lot of that has to do with timing in terms of some of the things we charged. We had a nice year-over-year response from that. We'd still continue to see opportunities for us to do a little bit better in some of the areas. And then, importantly, we are expecting utility costs to be a little bit higher in 2013 versus '12, which would lead to a higher utility reimbursement for us than we received in 2012. And so we do think we will continue to do better than the midpoint of our guidance in other income, which is 4.75%. And that helps boost us to that amount of 4.75% for total revenue.","Operator","And the next question is from David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I have a question on the dividends, so I think this is for Chairman Considine maybe. Terry, you've increased the dividend quite nicely over the last couple of quarters -- or I should say over the last year. Can we assume that the current rate will stay pretty flat for this year? I mean, the increases were not prompted because of net taxable income increase, these were discretionary choices on behalf of the board.","Terry Considine","David, yes. This is Terry. The board tries to keep the dividend -- our policy is that the dividend be in the range of 60% of AFFO and tends to set it once a year. Last year, we had a midyear increase after the equity raised in May, which led to a reduction of preferred stock dividends.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You took out of couple of high coupon preferred last year. The preferred market is still very attractive. I mean, there are some places now suggesting that rates might rise, and I think you are attracted to preferreds on the balance sheet. Can you -- can we expect you to move sooner rather than later in terms of perhaps issuing at a lower coupon?","Ernest M. Freedman","David, this is Ernie. With regards to preferreds, we do keep a close eye on that market. We've been a large issuer of preferreds in the past, and we just love the nature of that paper, in that you can lock in a fixed rate forever. To be in that paper is professional. And rates -- interestingly, even the deals that have been announced most recently by some of the other sectors, if rates continue to be very favorable even with the rise in 10-year over the last 90 days. So we keep our eye on it, but it really comes down for us as to what would be the right use of proceeds. And so when we compare preferreds, we compare that to our financing options, where today with 10-year debt, at the property level, we can secure that debt kind in the 3.80% to 3.90% range. And so as long as that range is pretty wide as to where you could potentially issue preferreds, at least where we sit today, we probably have a vent to continue to refinance with 10-year property debt. But we monitor that, we look at that carefully. And if the circumstances are right, we would certainly consider tapping back into that market.","Operator","And the next question is from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So do you also keep close eye on the common equity market? $28 -- more than $28 a share. I mean, at what point does the deleveraging strategy may be involved going into the equity markets again?","Terry Considine","Rich, this is Terry. We're delighted to see $28, when we look in one direction. But when we look at market estimates and net asset value in the low- and middle-$30 per share, we know we're still at a discount. We've got some further increase in share prices to come.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Fair enough. I see that now. Our number is over $30, so okay. And then, the next kind of, I don't know, big-picture question for you, Terry, you usually have a good perspective on things. At the risk of sounding kind of insensitive about Sandy, me being one of the -- those that got inconvenienced, do you think that there's a potential silver lining here over the longer term? A lot of people going back to work, $60 billion into the economy that actually will be spent as opposed to the banks holding on to their money when we bailed them out. Just curious if you think something like that could happen in consideration of the losses you talked about earlier on in the call.","Terry Considine","Rich, I think the general experience around storms, including Sandy, will be that there's short-term stimulus but largely it's relocation of activity that would otherwise have occurred.","Operator","And the next question is from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","A few questions specific to your transaction expectations on Page 6. First of all, for acquisitions during the course of 2013, that will be limited to just $45 million of tenders and mergers?","Ernest M. Freedman","Dave, this is Ernie. Based on what we've laid out, we expect very minimal, if no acquisition activity. We will continue to see if there's opportunities for us to complete fair trades, that would make sense for us, that would put pressure on us having to potentially sell more assets or come up with another way to fund those. But where we sit today, we don't see very much happening on the acquisition front other than we've laid out in the guidance.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on dispositions, can you talk about the decision to pull back on disposition volume in 2013?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, Dave, again, it comes down to us for use of proceeds, and so we want to make sure we've laid out a plan where we can fund our identified needs. And for us, those are around our capital spending and our redevelopment spending. And if we see opportunities to invest further dollars in accretive ways, then we will consider increasing those sales proceeds. But the plan does put us on a pace to pretty much exit the Affordable assets. We can exit in 2013. That will leave us with our low-income housing tax credit deals that were redeveloped between 2005 and 2007, that time frame, and we keep close tabs on it. John and his team spend a lot of time considering what may be opportunities for us and will be the right fair trades.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And then, really just the opposite of Rich's question and based on Terry's comment about the discount NAV, can you just provide us with your updated thoughts on the possibility of accelerating dispositions and repurchasing stock at some point this year?","Terry Considine","David, we don't have it in our base case or in the guidance we've given you. We obviously look at the market and as Ernie says, we keep a close eye on possible sources of capital and use of proceeds. But broadly, what we recognize is a significant discount between the share price and net asset value. We're focused more on accomplishing our business objectives of improving the profitability of the assets we own and operate, improving the results and redevelopment and meeting our leverage targets.","Operator","And the next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to, I think, the -- not the last question, but the talks about transaction timing and Affordable portfolio sale, can you give us kind of a timeline on that and kind of how you expect the dispositions to play out? Would; -- do you see more back-end loaded, front-end loaded?","Ernest M. Freedman","Mike, it's Ernie. You're absolutely right. It's going to be very much back-end loaded, and you can see in our guidance walk that we provided for '12 and '13 that we're not expecting a whole lot of dilution in 2013 from 2013 asset sales. Most of our disposition activity on the Conventional side is weighted to the very end of the third quarter to the fourth quarter. On the Affordable side, we will have a couple of assets that do close here in the first part of the year, which are carryovers from 2012. But again, the vast majority of that is also back-end loaded and expected to happen in the fourth quarter.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Second of all, last year you gave us kind of a year-end 2012 leverage target, as well as what to expect in terms of under redevelopment at the end of the year. Can you give us targets for where you expect to be at '13 and also how much you expect to have in the redevelopment by year-end?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. From a leverage target, Mike, we think we're going to get by early '14 -- on an annualized quarter basis, we're going to hit our 7x target, I would suspect, at the end of '13. That's going to put us around 7.3 or so, and that's debt and preferred to EBITDA. So very close to getting that 7x but maybe not quite making it. But I think we'll get there by the first part of 2014. With regard to redevelopment this year, we're expecting to spend $130 million to $160 million, and that's still on the same 10 projects that we introduced in 2012. We expect the total spend of those to be a little bit north of $400 million. In our base plan, we're not anticipating starting any new projects outside of those 10. That said, we're working hard and we've got -- we're planning. But my guess is, at least where we sit today, the items we're planning today won't get us -- that aren't underway today won't get a start until 2014.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just to follow up to that. The 3 coastal California communities obviously are not providing a drag. What kind of drag do you think from the other properties -- as you're redeveloping them in 2013, what kind of drag should we expect?","Ernest M. Freedman","Very little. The net impact of all of our redevelopment activities is about a negative $0.01 when you factor in what's happening with NOI, as well as what's -- factoring in what changes in capitalized interest and then any new interest we're incurring on those transactions. But the vast majority of our $130 million to $160 million spend, Mike, in 2013 is coming from those 3 big projects. We have less than $20 million anticipated from any of the other projects.","Operator","Our next question is from Buck Horne of Raymond James & Associates.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Kind of hypothetically here, just thinking about the Washington D.C. effect and all the politics going on, have you guys thought about the impact to your Washington D.C. properties, if there were to be a some sort of sequestration effect or some sort of form of sequestration went into effect? How would Aimco's properties be affected given your market position? And just more generally, what kind of assumptions do you have baked into your guidance for the Washington D.C. area?","Terry Considine","Buck, this is Terry. And despite my fond hopes, I don't actually worry too much about extreme cutbacks in government spending. However, it could be there'd be some volatility if some of the sequesters and other sort of approaches to the government spending occur. But mostly, that won't affect us. We are at a lower price point by design in Washington. We're basically a C+, B- portfolio there, and I would expect we'd be relatively steady through it.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Also, just thinking about move-outs to ownership, have you seen any trends there? Is it steady? Or is there any upticks in terms of move-outs to home ownership? And can you distinguish between any differences between -- move-outs to ownerships between your A properties and your B properties?","Keith M. Kimmel","Buck, this is Keith. I'll take that. In the fourth quarter, we saw move-outs for homeownership at 15%, which has basically been right in line almost through the entire 2012. They're definitely -- when we look at San Francisco and Miami, some of our higher price points where the barrier to entry is more difficult as some of the lower reasons for move-out to buy homes in those 2 markets.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one -- just last quick one, maybe for Ernie. Does the first quarter guidance include any extra snow removal cost for the storm this weekend?","Ernest M. Freedman","It's one of the reasons why we budgeted for slightly higher casualty costs. Joking aside, we know that it potentially could be a big storm. And 2 years ago, we had problems with that. In the Northeast, especially around old Flatley assets, the Royal Crest property. So we have built in a little bit into our numbers for a potential of higher casualty events. We have not --  we did also build into our numbers a more normalized snow removal expectation. We do put in contracts in place that allow us to have snow removal around a certain average -- or excuse me, a certain range of snowfall. This snowfall, by itself, won't put us over that range. But certainly, if it continues to be a snowy winter beyond this, that could put a little bit of pressure on our expenses in the first quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered by now. But I just wanted to get a little bit of color from you in terms -- I know you've talked a little bit about raising the dividend in the past. Obviously, I don't think it came as a big surprise when you did. But can you talk to us a little bit about going forward how you're going to look at use of proceeds from asset sales and cash flows, et cetera, to reduce leverage maybe in excess of your target 7x or even buy back shares, as opposed to raising the dividend? And maybe give us some color on the conversation the board had with regards to raising the dividend versus buying back shares.","Terry Considine","Ryan, this is Terry. And I would say that the board's view around the dividend and the tender activities is to emphasize balance. And so we think increasing the dividend based on AFFO growth is a reasonable way to reward shareholders. And as Ernie's given guidance, we expect higher AFFO growth in 2013. And if so, it would be consistent for the board to raise the dividend again in January of next year. Redevelopment and other investment activities are all tracked, as Ernie has mentioned, on a comparison to cost of capital and expected return on capital. So we analyze those through a free cash flow internal rate of return, and we work systematically to find lower cost of capital through sale of properties at attractive prices and reinvestment, either in acquisitions or redevelopment.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","So then, if I understood you correctly, the board doesn't take into consideration where the stock might be trading, in a discount to NAV, when determining -- when setting dividend?","Terry Considine","The board does consider that, and they look at that. And again, as I mentioned in an answer to an earlier question, at the current time and given the amount of expected sales or available sales, we think the better emphasis is improving the profitability of the portfolio and meeting our leverage targets. Let me be clear, we're not at all uncomfortable of share buybacks. We bought back about $1 billion 4 or 5 years ago. And if that seems the right course for shareholders, that's exactly what we'll do. But what we're focused on today is removing issues we think that may be leading to the discount, rather than trying to exploit the discount. And we think -- and so in terms of that, we've made great progress in reducing our leverage. You can see it coming down by 0.6 or 0.7 turns inside of Ernie's guidance. And if that were -- if the board were to decide it wanted a different leverage target, you can see it's pretty straightforward to get that in years ahead.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Either Ernie or Keith, can you talk about what the property tax assumption is in your 2.5% to 4% expense guidance for the year?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes, happy to, Rob. This is Ernie. We expect real estate taxes to go up between 5% and 8%. We also expect insurance and utilities to also go up between 5% and 8%. And all the other expense items will be about flat. And those first 3 I described are about almost exactly half of our expenses at property levels. That's how you get to 2.5% to 4.%.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And so in that flat would be personnel costs and how much is that?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, personnel costs, on an overall basis, is roughly, I don't know, I think 25% to 28% of our costs, and we do expect those to be flat. We do -- we are earning in increases that folks have received in terms of pay raises from July of last year. We're anticipating a similar pay increase in July of 2013. But offsetting those increases are the fact that we continue to find some ways to run our properties a little bit more efficiently.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And in terms of assets to sort of shuffle up to the top in terms of most likely [indiscernible], do you look -- I mean, is property tax increases at this point in the cycle something that drives some of that where some of these markets where you may see double-digit increases in property taxes having you marking those assets for sale rather sooner than later?","Terry Considine","Rob, this is Terry. In each sale, we look at expected free cash flow internal rate of return. And so whether we're making an investment decision or a sale, which is a negative investment decision, we look at expected revenues and costs. And adverse developments in costs for taxes, similarly to adverse developments in cost for repairs or utilities or things of that nature, all get put together in the analysis, and we hope to sell our weaker properties at where we can get a favorable cost of capital.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you, all, for your interest in Aimco. We're pleased by 2012 results, and we look forward to another good year in 2013. Be well.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2014 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO.","A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco.","Our strategy has always been to increase the amount and quality of our operating results, all as measured by AFFO and NAV per share. For the past few years, we focused on: first, providing competitive operating results, emphasizing customer retention and cost control; second, upgrading the Aimco portfolio through paired trades, where we sold our lowest rated properties to fund accretive investment activity, almost entirely redevelopments, that both increased our financial returns as measured by free cash flow margin and expected growth rate and improved our portfolio quality as measured by average revenue per apartment home; third, strengthening the Aimco balance sheet by reducing leverage to a ratio to EBITDA of less than 7:1; fourth, simplifying our business to reduce offsite costs and to increase transparency to our shareholders; and fifth, supporting a collaborative performance-oriented culture to engage teammates and foster superior performance.","The end of a year is a good time to report on how we're doing. And here's how I see it, looking back over the past 4 years, the time after the fiscal crisis and the initial bounce back. Keith and his team are doing a solid job in operations. Our growth rate has improved, and we are consistently above average in local markets results compared to peer results in the same markets. Our customer retention is well above average, and our cost control is remarkable. For example, over the past 4 years, the compounded annual growth rate for property cost before taxes, insurance and utilities is negative for 4 years. John and his team have done a great job in selling more than 36,000 apartment homes over the same 4 years, taken from the lowest-rated properties in our portfolio and including a large-scale reduction of our Affordable business.","So while the scale of the Aimco enterprise remains more than $10 billion in gross asset value, it is more focused in fewer properties, with higher rents and with better prospects. More than 200 properties were sold at free cash flow cap rates in the low 5% range, raising capital at an attractive cost, as the expected free cash flow internal rates of return for the properties sold were in the low 6% range. That capital was then reinvested accretively through paired trades and redevelopments and other capital uses, with expected free cash flow IRRs greater than 9%.","So one result is that our growth rate will be higher with our new investments. This will become particularly evident as we complete our 3 large California redevelopments, which, by themselves, are expected to add more than $0.05 to next year's AFFO per share. A second consequence is that quality, as measured by the average rent per apartment home, has increased at a faster clip than achieved by any peer. It was up 8% last year to about $1,470 a month. This is not the Aimco portfolio of just 4 years ago.","Ernie and Patti Fielding and his team have led our efforts to reduce leverage to our target. Having succeeded 2 years ahead of schedule, they are now seeking an investment-grade rating. We expect leverage to continue to decline in the coming years. Ernie and the entire Aimco team have been remarkably disciplined in reducing off-site costs by more than 1\/3 over the past 4 years to reflect our simpler, more focused business. By emphasis on a collaborative, respectful and performance-oriented culture, we have made these substantial changes while maintaining high morale, achieving record scores for team engagement and being recognized by The Denver Post as one of the top places to work in our state.","The goal and our strategy and its execution is to produce superior shareholder returns. Over the past 4 years, net asset value per share has increased by about 80%, and dividends per share have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 24%. And shareholder returns have been comfortably in the top quartile of our apartment REIT peers, whether looking at the past 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-year periods. I thank my colleagues and the entire Aimco team for their hard work to earn these excellent results. Our plan and commitment to 2014 is for more of the same progress in operations, portfolio quality, balance sheet strength, cost discipline and collaborative teamwork. We believe that this is a proven formula to create shareholder value.","Now for more detail about 2013 results and 2014 prospects, I'd like to turn the call to my senior colleagues, beginning with Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, Property Operations. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. We feel good about our 2013 results. Our on-site teams executed our plan with enthusiasm and continued commitment to excellent customer service. We were rewarded with continued low turnover and renewal rent increases averaging 5.1% for the year. For those leases expired and were not renewed, new leases were signed at rates that were, on average, 1.5% higher than the expiring leases. We achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.3% for the year, creating a book of business that will earn in over the course of 2014. Our operations team also continued to find innovative and sustainable ways of controlling costs and increasing efficiencies. Operating expenses, less insurance, taxes and utility expense, were down 60 basis points versus prior year.","Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Blended lease rates were up 2%. Renewal rent increases were healthy at 4.6%, with particular strength in California, Miami and Denver, where renewal rates are up between 6% and 8%. New lease rates were, on average, 60 basis points lower than the rates on the corresponding expiring leases. This is a result -- this result is a product of 2 drivers: a normal seasonal slowdown in new lease rates and an additional impact from supply challenged mid-Atlantic markets.","Turnover for the quarter was 48%. Of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 16% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. We continue to be successful at replacing move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was $108,000. The median income was $68,000, resulting in a rent-to-income ratio of 21%. Year-over-year, the median income of our new residents was up 10%. Our operations team also continued to implement several programs designed to provide additional value to our customers through a variety of products and services, generating other income growth of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","Now looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up 2\/3 of our revenue. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from 6.5% to nearly 8% for the quarter. This was led by Miami, followed by the Bay Area and Chicago. Our steady performers for the quarter, with midrange growth of 4% to 5%, were Los Angeles, Orange County, Denver and San Diego. Rounding out our 10 largest markets, we had Boston, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia.","As we look ahead to early first quarter results, January blended lease rates were up 2.3%, with new lease rates flat and renewals up 4.6%. January's average daily occupancy was 95.6%, on plan and an improvement on both the fourth quarter and prior year. February and March renewal offers went out with 4.5% to 7% increases.","2014 revenue growth in our top 10 markets can be broken into 3 tiers. At the top of the list, comprising 37% of revenue contribution, with forecasted growth between 5% and 7%, we have the Bay Area, Miami, Denver, Chicago and Los Angeles. The midrange markets, with forecasted growth between 3% and 4%, are Orange County, San Diego and Philadelphia. And rounding out the top 10, we have Washington, D.C. and Boston, forecasted to have positive growth around 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively.","And great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success. I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John E. Bezzant","Thanks, Keith. Today, I will recap our 2013 portfolio management and investment activities and provide some specifics around our plans for 2014. As a reminder, our portfolio management activities are driven by paired trades, where the projected free cash flow internal rate of return of an investment is greater than that of the property or properties sold to fund the investment and where our portfolio qualities are increased or enhanced. As we execute this strategy, we use the same 10-year free cash flow IRR model, reflecting cash flows after capital spending across all of our investment activities.","During 2013, we sold 29 properties, with about 7,000 apartment homes, generating gross proceeds to Aimco of $406 million. These property dispositions came in about $30 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by opportunities to accelerate capital recycling and portfolio enhancement. We sold 16 of our lowest-rated Conventional properties, with average revenue per apartment home of $874, 40% below the average of our retained portfolio. Among the properties sold were the last we held in Dallas-Fort Worth; Tampa, Daytona Beach and Naples, Florida; and Detroit. We also sold 13 Affordable Properties.","On average, the properties sold in 2013 had a free cash flow cap rate of 5.6%. Had we held these properties for the next 10 years, as modeled in our free cash flow internal rate of return model, we would have expected them to generate a return of about 6.5%. Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, a handful of partnership and other acquisitions and property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return about 300 basis points higher than the properties sold to fund them.","As we maintain this paired trade discipline in our investment activities, we continue to see improvement in the quality of our portfolio. As Terry has noted, our 2013 capital recycling, combined with same-store revenue growth, led to an 8% increase in our portfolio average revenue per apartment home. And as a point of reference for the market transformation in the Aimco portfolio in recent years, at $1,469 per month, our average revenue per apartment home is 30% higher than 4 years ago, one of the highest rates of growth amongst the peer group.","An important contributor to enhanced portfolio quality is our redevelopment program. In 2013, we completed 2 projects and made good progress on our multiyear redevelopments. In the fourth quarter, construction and deliveries on these projects proceeded according to plan. We ended the year with 204 apartment homes completed at Lincoln Place, with 161 of those occupied. At Pacific Bay Vistas, we had 132 apartment homes completed and 121 of those occupied. And at Preserve at Marin, we signed our first leases in late December and welcomed our first residents to the property in January. Our redevelopment leasing in 2013 achieved average rents above underwriting, and we continue to see solid rent growth in our redevelopment markets and hope to continue our leasing success in 2014.","Moving on to our plans for this year. We will continue to follow our paired trade approach to portfolio management, with reinvestment of sales proceeds and properties where rents, long-term growth rates, operating margins and free cash flow internal rates of return exceed comparable metrics on the properties sold. Our 2014 plan is to sell $250 million to $290 million of Conventional properties and $50 million to $60 million of Affordable Properties, generating net proceeds to Aimco of $180 million to $220 million. We expect most of our sales activity to occur in the first half of the year, with 2 transactions already closed and others well underway.","Specific to our redevelopment activity for this year, as I mentioned earlier, construction and leasing activity are progressing well at Pacific Bay Vistas, Preserve at Marin and Lincoln Place. The completion of lease-up of these 3 projects will increase our investment in and our share of revenue from the strong Bay Area and the rebounding southern California markets from roughly 1\/4 of our portfolio today to nearly 1\/3. During 2014, we will continue our redevelopment of The Sterling in Philadelphia, where we also look forward to the construction, starting this summer, of the Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. This expansion of Comcast's headquarters presence in Philadelphia will add 1.5 million square feet of office and luxury hotel space, with 2,800 new jobs right next door to our Sterling property.","We also plan to start a second redevelopment project this year in Philadelphia, as well as others in Seattle and southern California. And we will complete the planning our anticipated 2015 starts. We have a deep pipeline of redevelopment opportunities within our existing portfolio and look forward to working on them in coming years.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our CFO.","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, John. First, I'll spend a few moments on our fourth quarter results. Second, I'll provide some details around the assumptions we used in providing our outlook for 2014. You can find all of our provided projections for 2014 on Pages 5 to 7 of our earnings release.","Regarding fourth quarter 2013 results, I'd like to turn first to our balance sheet as, importantly, we ended the year with leverage to EBITDA of 7.2x, putting us right on top of our 7x target that we established a couple of years ago. We have reached this milestone 2 years faster than we originally anticipated when announcing this goal. As to earnings, our fourth quarter AFFO was $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and FFO is $0.01 ahead.","Looking forward to 2014. In operations, we anticipate same-store revenue growth between 3% and 4%. Keith noted that we achieved blended lease rate increases of 3.3% in 2013, so half of that will earn in during 2014. We expect to achieve similar blended lease rate increases in 2014.","Other income, which makes up about 10% of our total property revenues, is expected to increase at a rate slightly higher than rent growth. The combination of these items and our expectation of similar occupancy rates for the year provides for a result at the midpoint of our guidance range.","On the expense side, projected increases in utilities and property taxes account for most of our projected 2% to 3% increase in expense growth. We expect the remainder of our property expenses to be up less than 1% compared to 2013.","Regarding our portfolio, as John has discussed, we exceeded our expectations for property sales in the fourth quarter, and we begin 2014 with most of our planned property sales anticipated to close in the first half of the year. As a result, and together with committed loans, funding plans for our redevelopment and development activities are largely in place. We anticipate the combination of market rent growth and our portfolio management activities will lead to another 8% increase in average revenues per apartment home.","Regarding our balance sheet, leverage to EBITDA should remain in the low-7s throughout 2014. We anticipate that leverage to EBITDA will dip to the high-6s in 2015 as our large redevelopment projects reach full year stabilized operations and as we continue to delever through scheduled property debt amortization. Debt amortization for 2014 totals $83 million, which we expect to fund through retained earnings as we've done for the last several years.","During 2014, we plan to continue to increase our unencumbered pool from about $380 million today to somewhere between $525 million and $575 million at the end of the year, based on current property values. We will continue to work with the rating agencies with the objective of gaining an investment-grade rating. And finally, regarding off-site cost, we expect to continue to adjust costs lower to adapt to our more simplified business.","These items provide the basis for our expectation that full year AFFO per share will be in the range of $1.63 to $1.73 per share, up 10% at the midpoint. AFFO growth continues to benefit from the elimination of the capital replacement spending associated with the 18,000 apartment homes sold over the past 2 years. For 2014, we have -- we also have a sizable reduction in capital replacement spending for our multiphase capital projects. Much of this decrease is at Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia, as we finish work in anticipation of its pending redevelopment.","We expect FFO to be up slightly from 2014 because our program of selling lower-rated properties results in NOI dilution at the FFO line that, over time, is offset by capital replacement savings at the AFFO line. Finally, as we announced last week, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.26 per share.","Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to take a few moments to summarize some of the items we discussed today. In operations, Keith and I provided guidance that our blended new and renewal lease rates will grow consistently with what we achieved in 2013. Certainly, it will differ by market, but overall, we are guiding to steady rent growth consistent with last year.","Regarding expenses, we are at our usual spot at the top of the pack in cost control. We have been at the top of the pack consistently for the last 7 years. This leads to an NOI expectation that is in the same range as are all the apartment peers, except for one.","Turning to our portfolio. We ended 2013 with average revenues per apartment home of $1,469. We will finish 2014 bumping up against $1,600. I hear from some folks that we have a portfolio that is well below the quality of our peers. It just is not the case. We have said our goal is to average a BB+ portfolio across all of our geographies. We really are getting to the point where we might need to drop the B from that description and just say B+.","John spoke about some of the properties we sold in 2013. We exited suburban Detroit. Chrysler and Bob Dylan may have a view that Detroit is coming back, and I hope they are right, but we think there are better opportunities elsewhere for us to invest our shareholders' capital. We sold out of Daytona Beach. I guess that means John, Keith, Lisa, Miles and I are going to have to find a different spring break property for our trip to go on this year. We sold Fisherman's Wharf, no, not the property in San Francisco, the Fisherman's Wharf in Clute, Texas. I'm sure you're all familiar with that city. Clute is famous for its Mosquito Festival, seriously. Go Google it.","The funny thing is John sold assets like these, as well as Affordable Properties, all from the very bottom of our portfolio at an NOI cap rate of 7.3% in 2013 and a free cash flow cap rate of 5.6%. Why is that funny? So I run some math this morning, we have leverage today of about $4.5 billion, including a mark to market on our debt. Where our stock is trading, we have a market cap of about $4.2 billion, so total capitalization of about $8.7 billion.","In Supplemental Schedule 3, we note that our trailing 12 NOI is $581 million. A 4% NOI growth would add about $23 million to this. We expect that once stabilized, in 2015, our big redev projects add approximately another $30 million to NOI over what they contributed in 2013. Offsetting this is about $27 million of property management expenses. So that totals about $605 million of NOI.","As you know, though, we measure profitability after capital replacement spend, not before. At $1,200 a door, that CR is $66 million, leaving total free cash flow from our properties of about $540 million. So with a total capitalization of $8.7 billion, NOI of $605 million and free cash flow of $540 million, we are currently trading at an implied forward NOI cap rate of 7% and a forward free cash flow cap rate of 6.2%. And we just sold from the bottom of our portfolio at 7.3% and 5.6%.","I certainly think our current portfolio with Conventional revenues approaching $1,500 is significantly better and is worth higher price than what we've got in from what we just sold that had revenues of $900. And I suspect, if you run the same math for all of our peers, you'll see that our implied cap rates are too high, especially since our NOI growth rate is about the same as all the apartment peers, except one.","Certainly, in the past, our balance sheet has been an outlier. But back in 2012, we told you that we had a goal to get to 7x. We did not want to be an outlier. We would create flexibility by growing in an unencumbered pool. We've been seeking an investment grade. Well, we can report that we're not an outlier anymore. There are certainly some peers with lower leverage than Aimco, but there are also some peers with higher leverage. We reached our 7x target 2 years faster than we laid out. We increased our unencumbered pool to almost $400 million currently, faster than what we said we would do at this time last year.","Finally, as I was watching the Super Bowl this past weekend and as the game got away from the Broncos, I started having thoughts about our upcoming call. I started imagining what the headlines might look like after our release went out. I envisioned something like, \"Omaha, Omaha, Aimco snaps the ball over their head with a 6% miss to consensus FFO.\" I was pleased to see that reports last night and today noted that while Aimco guidance missed consensus FFO for 2014, more importantly, Aimco was on plan doing what we said we would do. We continue to have solid operating results. We are markedly improving our portfolio through our paired trade discipline. We are markedly improving our balance sheet as we bring leverage down, and we'll bring it down further. We will continue to seek an investment grade.","Our focus is to grow cash flow and create value in our activities for our shareholders, and I want to thank our shareholders for their support, guidance and advice. And I want to thank my Aimco teammates who make it happen.","With that, now, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Pehl at Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if, you've kind of touched briefly on this in your opening remarks, but when you expect your redevelopment cash flows will affect earnings over the next couple of years, in '14 and '15.","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Jeff, this is Ernie, I'll take that. We disclosed it in the release. You can see in the footnotes to our outlook page, as well as in our walk. For 2014, we expect redev contribution of about $0.07 to NOI. So that's going to be a good guide to cash flow. Offsetting that, though, is going to be the fact that, from an FFO perspective, we're going to have increased interest expense as we fund those loans of about $0.02. And not a cash flow item, but certainly an FFO item, we're going to drop off capitalized interest of about $0.05. So in 2014, we'll have a $0.05 contribution to cash flow from redev activities. But from an FFO perspective, because capitalized interest is dropping off because we're delivering units, we'll actually have a very minimal impact to our FFO and AFFO numbers for 2014. For 2015, the good news is that we expect that to grow even further still. We think a little bit -- a contribution of NOI of about $0.11 from those big 3 redevelopment projects. No more interest expense as the loans will have been fully funded early in 2014 and a slight drop-off in capitalized interest of another $0.04. So in total, as we noted in our release, the $0.07 good guy to FFO in 2015 compared to '14. And then, there'll be a $0.01 charge for capital replacements as we start going through our typical capital replacement program at those redevelopment programs. So better contribution for cash flow than for FFO. But I want to make sure people understood both of those numbers for their models.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, you've been very active in redevelopment versus ground-up development. But could there be a shift towards more ground-up developments, like your One Canal Street project going forward?","John E. Bezzant","Jeffrey, this is John. We did One Canal because that was a deal where we saw an opportunity to enhance our portfolio in Boston and recycle some capital out of suburban and tertiary markets and put it to work in a market we thought had better long-term prospects and a property we thought had better long-term prospects. While that is an element, I would call it an arrow in our quiver, but it is not our only arrow. It's one we will use selectively from time to time. But I would envision that redevelopment for the foreseeable future will continue to be the bulk of our reinvestment activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Joseph at Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you break down what makes up other income and quantify your expectation for other income growth in 2014?","Ernest M. Freedman","Which other income are you referring to, Nick? Is that the other income -- the other revenue...","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. The 10% that you talked about in terms of...","Ernest M. Freedman","I just want to clarify that. So within other revenue, other revenue mix of about 10% of our contribution to total revenue is at the property level. About half of that, about 5% of that comes from utility reimbursements, where, with our properties, typically, we get the utility bills and ensure the -- and charge our customers, our residents, of their fair share. And about half of that comes from other fees and items like garage, storage, parking, pet rents, application fees and the like. In the past many years, Nick, as you've noted, before, we have been able to grow that a little bit faster than we've been able to grow rents per unit. But we look at the total contribution. In 2014, we expect utility reimbursements to grow at a pace a little bit faster than we're projecting for a total revenue growth, and we're expecting those other fees to grow about the same pace as we expect for other revenue growth. In the past couple of years, we've had the opportunity to grow other income by 10% and better. That's not in our projections this year to get to the midpoint of guidance, just slightly better than our other -- our rental revenue growth.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ernie, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. So enjoyed your math walk-through that you did. You're clearly frustrated with where the stock is at. So what else can you do about it and what other levers can you pull? And I do appreciate the fact that you've gotten the balance sheet to where you sort of wanted to get it to, but it still is modestly more highly leveraged than where the industry is at. So it doesn't seem like aggressive share buybacks or aggressive selling and special dividending it out is a wise use of capital. So sort of how do you narrow this gap that you see that the market is not willing to pay for?","Ernest M. Freedman","Mike, let me take a first stab, and then I'm sure Terry is going to add a comment, too. And first, I certainly don't want to come across as being frustrated with it. We're actually pleased with the results we're making. In the last 2 years, our discount to consensus NAV is actually closed by half compared to peers. It certainly had a better acceleration there from 2011 to 2012 versus '12 to '13, but we're making progress. And I just think, Mike, we just got to keep our mind and focus on all the great progress we're making because we're making it over a long period of time. And that's certainly why, in our prepared remarks statement, we wanted to call out some of those good things that have happened over the last few years in terms of average revenue per apartment home growing the way it has. The fact that we're getting to a balance sheet that's not an outlier, and we've always talked about the safety of our balance sheet and feel good about it. But we're certainly in the pack with other folks. And so I think it's just more of the same with what we're doing and talking to folks and making sure they understand. And I know Terry certainly has some thoughts on that. Terry?","Terry Considine","Well, Michael, I would say that it's not unusual for the business to improve faster than the market's understanding of it. We do trade at a discount to net asset value. But as Ernie pointed out, it's half the relevant discount it was just a couple of years ago. And in the interim, we've provided stellar stockholder returns. So compared to peers, we're in the top quartile of total stockholder returns in -- whether you look at the last year, the last 2 years, the last 3 years, the last 4 years or the last 5 years. So Ernie is right. We're not frustrated. We're ambitious, and we're hopeful that we'll make further progress on pricing the stock.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just in terms of the sizing of the transactions that you said had already been completed or under contract, just from a sales disposition program. Can you sort of outline some of that?","John E. Bezzant","Sure. This is John. We've closed 2 deals, one on each side of the shop, the Conventional and the Affordable side of the shop. The business that is booked at this point in time, we have things under contract, the vast majority of it under contract, but also in due diligence still. So we don't want to commit that those are guaranteed lockdown. They're not under contract -- not all of them are under-contract hard at this point in time. But we have a pretty clear path to achieving most of our results in the first half of the year.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the first half, but is there -- it sounds like things are even accelerating from that. I'm just trying to figure out, from a modeling standpoint, how early do we have to. . .","John E. Bezzant","Bulk of the impact would be toward the end of the second quarter.","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes. Based on the size of the transactions or when it happens, it will be a little bit less in the first and more in the second, if you're trying to hammer it down from an all-in perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to ask Michael's question in a slightly different way. You guys have done a lot of the sort of the right things that the public market has asked, that you outlined pretty extensively in the opening comments and the NAV discount still persists. Can you just give your thoughts about privatization and M&A as a potential way to possibly narrow the gap and sort of just your thoughts around that?","John E. Bezzant","Karin, our thoughts around M&A are that M&A is often value destructive for the buyer so that we would be quite cautious and disciplined about looking at an acquisition. If it were to be that a person -- if we looked at an opportunity to privatize Aimco, I would think that we'd look at it as good shareholders. I mean, we're significant shareholders as in the management team and on the board. And the board, in making the decision, will focus on what creates the most value, over time, on a risk-adjusted basis.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you guys have done a great job squeezing out the offsite costs and keeping expense control. How much more room induced do you think there is in the platform as it stands today? And how much longer do you think that you can keep expenses sort of below trend?","Terry Considine","Karen, it's Terry. We looked around the room because everybody raised their hand, because we're all engaged in it. We think there's plenty to do, that there are opportunities to get better at what we do and that productivity will drive lower costs. And we're optimistic that we'll do that again this year and that we'll do it in the years ahead.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question for me. Can you just give us a sense, Ernie, just a timing on when you think the Lincoln Place tax credit will be coming into the income statement?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, sure. Good question, Karin. Those will come in ratably throughout the year. And so that $10 million to $11 million number that I note in guidance, you can assume about 1\/4 of that each year. So we earned those as the redevelopment dollars are spent and we expect we'll be spending redevelopment dollars on Lincoln Place up through about November, December of 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Bennett at Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I just want to ask a couple of questions on first on the renewal side. You realized 4.6%, the fourth quarter in January. What were you going out with to the market for those renewals versus what you achieved?","Keith M. Kimmel","Typically, those were going out at 5% to 6.5% is what the ask was.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And then just quickly on the markets. In your comments earlier, I think you kind of grouped Los Angeles in your top bucket along with some of the Northern Californian market. I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of -- possibly the convergence of Southern California revenue growth and in Northern California and what your views are there?","Keith M. Kimmel","Ryan, let me -- I'll walk you through that. So as we look at Northern California, Northern California continues to be quite healthy. And while there's been some level of moderation, if we look at the third quarter at 10% revenue growth and in the fourth quarter being at 8%, it still could have been one of our top performers. As we look at Los Angeles, the way we think about Los Angeles is it has been very strong for us over the past several quarters, and we're quite optimistic as we look at our particular portfolio in the West side of Los Angeles and how fantastic our assets are, and our on-site operations team is one of the best in the business and we're -- we believe that in '14, we'll continue to build upon our '13 successes as being best-in-class.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just lastly from me, just in terms of Philadelphia, I think you grouped that into the market that's going to see same-store revenue growth above 4%. I think it kind of ended the fourth quarter about flat year-over-year. Curious what's driving that and does it potentially -- what the contribution is from you putting some of the Philadelphia assets into redevelopment into that 4% number?","Keith M. Kimmel","Ryan, I'll start with -- just the prepared remarks. Let me clarify. Philadelphia was in the 3% to 4% range, just for a clarification there. What we see in Philadelphia, is in '13, there is quite a bit of new supply, particularly in Center City. A lot of that has been absorbed. There will be some that will carry forward into '14. I'd also point out that we have talked about in previous calls that we had some operational opportunities, and we're quite confident in the team that's there, and how they'll be able to execute better going into '14. And so with that, let me turn it over to Ernie, to give some insight around the redevelopment question.","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes, Ryan, with regards to your question on whether redevelopment will provide a benefit for us in that 3% to 4% growth rate for Philadelphia. The answer is, no. Sterling, which we announced here in our earnings release, which is now undergoing redevelopment, has been moved out of our same-store pool. So as of the first quarter, its results and any benefits from redevelopment will not be reflected in same-store, so not in that 3% to 4%. Similarly, we do anticipate later in the year that Park Towne Place, which started its redevelopment, and as that commences and ramps up, we would then at that point take Park Towne place out of redevelopment. So our results in Philadelphia truly are a same-store view that Keith talked to.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Anderson at BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just curious, do you have any properties in Omaha? You mentioned the $0.07 of impact from redev in 2015, netting it all up. But when you layer in dispositions, I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of the net-net number, right, when you consider how you'll fund that. Is it going to be a positive number in 2015 as opposed to negative $0.20 of dispositions in the 2014 number? How does that math work out for next year?","Ernest M. Freedman","Rich, that's a good point, because that $0.07 good guy really helps offset in '15 the $0.20 bad guy you're seeing in 2014. All our redevelopments will be fully funded in 2014 with the proceeds from sales that we achieved from 2013 sales as well as 2014. So there won't be a bad guy in 2015 from our property sales that help fund the investment of those redevelopment projects. Now of course, we will likely have other paired trades and commence other redevelopments and those property sales would have an impact. But for the big 3, the cash is pretty much in hand in this point through loan commitments and or through property sales that John's going to close shortly, and that's part of the lumpiness and jumbleness that happens with AFFO around the timing with this.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So to put it real simple, it's minus $0.20 today for 2014 versus plus $0.07 next year when you just look at those kind of bulky factors?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure and plus the $0.07 from 2014 that we disclosed in our walk on the -- in our outlook section as well. So it is -- I don't want to run away from the fact that it\u2019s dilutive to FFO. It certainly is. But when we measure our profitability to AFFO, and AFFO are paired trade investment activity worst case scenario has been breakeven for us is typically a little accretive, but you're looking at it the right way, Rich.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then I was just looking back at the third quarter conference call and I asked the question to you about deleveraging and you said, we wanted to deleverage but -- and we hope that gets us investment grade rating but that is not our goal, that's how you put it. Sorry to stick you with what you'd said in the past. What is changed for you to now say, that is our goal?","Ernest M. Freedman","All right. I probably didn't say it very well in the third quarter, Rich. We would like to get to investment grade. I guess what I was trying to say back in the third quarter was we were going to do what we plan on doing regardless if we got to investment-grade or not. We think it's smart to have an unencumbered pool, regardless of whether the rating agencies -- I think that's the way we need to go to -- get to investment grade. We think it's smart to be not an outlier with our balance sheet. We think it's smart to use property debt, long dated, nonrecourse amortizing. It's that's why I mixed up my words and didn't say it very well in the third quarter. We certainly hope all that equates to an investment grade and I do feel comfortable saying that's a goal of ours. If we don't achieve that and still have leverage in the high 6, 6s, we still focus on property debt, which is say for a fixed rate long-term amortizing, we're going to do all right by the balance sheet. So, appreciate you gave me the opportunity to clarify that.","Operator","Next question comes from Dave Bragg at Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I do think that Rich has a point as it relates to the change in your view on going unsecured -- rather over the last several years. And my question relates to what your outlook for the ultimate future of Fannie and Freddie has to do with that strategy?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well there Dave, I certainly don't want to communicate everyone that we want to go down the unsecured route, that's not the case. We want to get to the investment grades. I think it's important to get that good housekeeping seal of approval from the rating agencies because we do believe, our strategy from a balance sheet safety perspective, is safe or safer than what others are employing. And that's why we want to get to the investment grade. So again, I'm glad you guys gave me a chance to clarify this, so there's no confusion. We're not seeking or thinking about going to unsecured route. That said, it's always nice to have that flexibility that something did change in the future. But that's not something we're expecting to do today. Regarding Fannie and Freddie, Terry, do you want to add anything there?","Terry Considine","I think the -- as Dave as you've reported the latest twist and turn on the GSCs is that they're likely to continue to be an important fact -- force in providing property debt to multifamily. But more broadly, if Freddie and Fannie go away, there will still be a very deep property debt market. And I'll expect it to price quite competitively with unsecured debt and -- but if it were to change, then we would adjust. But for the moment, I think Ernie has got it exactly right, we like the safety and we like the liquidity of the property debt market.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Ernie, can you provide the Affordable same-store NOI growth in '13 and the expectations for '14?","Ernest M. Freedman","I don't know if I have those exactly handy for '13. For '14, we expect it to be about 2%. I believe the '13 number was kind in that 1% to 2% range. I just don't have it in front of me right now, Dave. So I think it's going to be consistent. It's going to be -- taste a little bit less, a little bit slower than our Conventional portfolio.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question relates to your guidance for similar rent growth in '14 versus '13. You and many of your peers saw deceleration in '13 from '12, and a lot of your peers are looking for an incremental deceleration in '14 versus '13. Why are your expectations that it will be the same?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, let\u2019s just talk about definitionally, Dave. In 2012 we had revenue growth of 4.7% . In 2013, we had revenue growth of 4.4%. And we are calling for -- at the midpoint of our guidance revenue growth in 2014 at 3.5%. So under that definition deceleration, we're seeing are under that -- those numbers, we're seeing deceleration, I think it's very consistent with our peers. But I think a lot of folks are saying that they kind of seeing that in terms of into, when you look at rates. So what's happening in the transaction markets, say when you look at new lease rates versus renewal rates in those blends, we're certainly seeing deceleration in some markets but we're seeing acceleration in others with our geographically diverse footprint in our different price points, we are projecting that for 2014 to get a blended new and renewal lease rate about the same as what we did in 2013 which is about 3.3%. And that doesn't seem to be too far off for what third parties are projecting for our markets, and didn't seem too far off just seeing what other people have talked about for what they expect to achieve for rental rate achievement in 2014.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Right. That was my focus, not same-store revenue growth. And so you're a little behind in January although that's a light month, but you expect to really close that gap as the year progresses. It sounds like you can get back to that level?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well the agenda -- you said it exactly right. January came in at 2.3% and we're expecting for the year to be roughly at 3.3%, and that would not be an abnormal growth to come out of those and close decent Qs in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste at Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Terry, the last few years, Aimco's talked about strategies culling the bottom 5%, 10% of portfolio to invest in redev, in acquisition of higher quality properties. Can you guys talk a bit more about the decision or strategy behind accelerating some of the near-term dispositions, weighing the short-term dilution impact? And can you discuss some thoughts on how the capital will be reinvested. It looks like there'll there be some excess disposition proceeds beyond the 2014 redev spend if all goes to plan?","Terry Considine","Haendel, first of all, thank you, those are very good questions. I think that around acceleration, there are really 2 thoughts. One is that we don't want to get our commitments very far ahead of our funding. And so we've made commitments to fund redevelopment and development activity, whether it's at Lincoln in the redevelopment sphere or One Canal in the development sphere. And we want to be sure we have cash on hand and we know what the cost of that capital is, so that we know that we're making a -- what would our spread or accretion will be on the use. I think, secondly, there may be a bit of a tactical feeling that pricing is good today and we might as well take it now and not be at risk for a future change. Does that answer your question?","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Broadly, I guess. Can you also talk generally about the buyer appetite for the product that you guys are selling? Have you noticed any change in the depth of the buyer interest, getting any pushback on pricing, any retrading?","Terry Considine","I think John would be more knowledgeable than I and I'd like to hand it to him.","John E. Bezzant","Yes. And I would tell you, Haendel, it's been pretty consistent over the course of the year. We've talked previously a few times about sales activity. We obviously had a very good year. A very good fourth quarter in terms of getting deals done and closed. As you look back into '14, as we've talked about previously, interest rates kind of ran up over the summer. There was what I would call a deep breath or a slight hiccup in August that then quickly dissipated in September as rates dropped back down again. And what we saw during that timeframe was, if you recall what we had in the market, it was effectively booked through the summer run-up and then we put some additional product to market in the fall. And frankly, saw a very little difference between the first half of the year and the second half of the year in terms of buyer appetite, pricing, cap rates and ability to execute and get deals closed.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Appreciate that. And then one more small, and maybe for your Keith. Can you talk, give some specifics on the new lease rates achieved in January specifically for your D.C. and for your Philadelphia portfolios?","Keith M. Kimmel","Sure, Haendel. In both those markets, they were about negative 6%. I mean, it just gives some context around that. What you see in the new product and new stuff coming online are given a month free to 2 months free, which a month free represents negative 8% to price and 2 is negative 16%. So negative 6%, I think it's a representation where the -- our product lies and be in BB+ product that it doesn't have the same impact that others might have.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to this -- talk about how your portfolio has changed versus what was in the past, and I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about, if you thought about the portfolio that you have today versus what you had in 2007. If you owned them both today based on today's cap rates, what's the different cap rate between those 2 portfolios? On a magnitude change, I am not asking to give a cap rate, but what, is it 50 basis points, is it 100 basis points?","Terry Considine","Well, you should -- it'll -- you also have to adjust for interest rates and the era. But if you take the average portfolio that we had in 2007, where average rents were.","Keith M. Kimmel","Half of what they are today.","Terry Considine","Half of what they are today, then I would say the spread on NOI cap rate might be 200 basis points and the spread on free cash flow cap rate might be","Keith M. Kimmel","Comparable.","Terry Considine","Comparable. But if you're interested in it, we can take a minute and give you a more scientific answer. But it's quite a big difference. If you think about, just the assets that are best-known if you will that we're investing in, a Lincoln Place will price in California at 4% or below at an NOI cap rate and at a free cash flow cap rate, not too much higher than that. And so, compared to properties that had $700 or $800 average rents, many of them in lesser markets. Today, those would price at, I don't know, 7 NOI.","Keith M. Kimmel","6 to 7.","Terry Considine","6 to 7.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right now, I understand, I mean, it sounds like you're talking a little bit more about what you've gotten rid of versus what you've incrementally invested. I'm wondering, as you think about your entire portfolio today, the average cap rate on that portfolio versus what you owned in 2007, what's the difference in that, because I think, as you did mention, your stock is trading a very similar employed cap rate -- employed cap rate or even a spread versus the rest of the group. Today, in 2007, yet you're saying that you deserve a lower cap rate. So any sort of commentary on what that -- what that benefit has been I think would be helpful?","John E. Bezzant","I think, Nick, of you take a look -- this is John. I think if you look at footprint would be one piece to look at. In 2007, we were probably pushing 70 markets that we're in and well over half of those were secondary and tertiary markets, where you would've seen cap rates if we were trading in them today that would have been easily 200 basis points higher than primary markets. That would be one element of it that you ought to look at. I think part of it, in terms of today's portfolio, we talked about having roughly 25% of our revenue or income coming out of California. And those -- that California portfolio is predominantly Peninsula in the Bay Area, and West L.A. and coastal San Diego. And cap rates in those markets are substantially lower than what we sell at for example. There's been a little nervousness in looking at some of the reports on our cap rates in the fourth quarter that is, Ernie has already alluded to, this is -- it's a mix of what sells, and as we look to sell in a rural community on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Detroit and Daytona Beach, those cap rates are not comparable to the remainder of our portfolio where we are very strong and very increasingly dedicated to course up markets in target markets.","Terry Considine","Yes. And Nick, this is Terry again. What I would come back in, I think the market does understand a lot of that change. There's a range of estimates out of peoples GAV for the company and NAV for the company. And the people at the higher end have it about right, in our opinion, that -- and so, as that analytical understanding has not yet fully translated into the share price. But I'd point out, as Ernie did, that we've narrowed the gap on discount to NAV by half over the last couple of years, and that there are other factors that go into pricing the stock besides just NAV, leverage being the example that again we focused on. So I think that we're quite optimistic that, that gap will narrow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ernie, just going to you gave good detail on the press release about capital replacements. Can you talk about the other bucket of CapEx, capital improvements? And then as we think about the reduction in capital replacements for '14, how much of that was related to trimming in asset sales versus expensively reinvesting in the properties over the last couple of years?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. With regards to capital improvements, we give guidance as well that we're spending some money on property upgrades, about roughly $40 million, $40 million to $45 million. Those are for projects like putting in similarly wood flooring, there projects like energy replacement projects, where we get more energy-efficient properties, just putting granite in the countertops and in our various properties. We've had a run rate over the last few years spending across entire portfolio about $40 million -- $30 million to $40 million a year. That's what those represent. And they get pretty good returns for us. They have long life, they help bring down expenses well as grow revenues and it's been a good way for us to create value for our shareholders. With regards to capital replacement spending and there's certainly a bunch of different numbers in our report. On our outlook page, we note that our capital replacement spending is going down from $75 million in 2013, down to $55 million in 2014. But as we talk about it in the release, a big chunk of that decrease is due to the fact that we've completed a significant amount of work at one of our properties, Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia, where we have 4 towers, approximately 960 units, and it's a 50-year old plus building where we're going into the guts and replacing the plumbing, the electrical, the mechanical, almost everything in there. And we're able to complete 3 of those 4 towers in 2013, which is at 1 left to go. That makes up almost all of the decrease in capital replacement spending. About $2 million or $3 million of that capital replacement spending decreased which is the fact that we have less units. That's one of the reasons why would we measure AFFO, because that's real spending that has to happen each year. Short of it, is Michael, we've actually increased our capital replacement spending on our current portfolio for what we're keeping for about $900 in 2013 to $1,000 in 2014, that's the right thing to do. We want to continue to maintain our assets and put the money into it, that is needed. So that's kind of the moving pieces and the parts of what's happening with capital replacements.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great color. I appreciate that. Second question, as you think about ramping up REIT, this probably more for Keith or John. As you think about ramping up redevelopment in the back half of the year on additional projects, as you complete the current pipeline, the 3 coastal California communities were vacant as you think about the next wave of redevelopment. How much displacement are you assuming on that in back half of '14? And as we kind of think about '15 at that point?","John E. Bezzant","Yes, I'll let Ernie speak to the potential dilution of future redev but just a couple things. One, in terms of our ramp-up. I would envision our run rate this year, we've guided $125 million to $150 million of redev activity this year. And we would envision that we would stay at roughly that run rate on a go forward basis. You are correct that the big 3 in California will come out of the pipeline this year and those will be backfilled with other projects as we move into '15, in terms of displacement, if you will. Typically, on those operating properties, there is some drag associated with the project. But we try to manage again within the scope of any specific project, we try to manage that by doing bulk of our work on turns. We certainly have no plans to empty out any properties to rehab them in our near-term pipeline, and would envision that the drag would be minimized to the extent we can. And I'll turn it to Ernie for a minute.","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes. John, sums it up well, Mike. With the projects we have going on right now, there's certainly isn't a drag at the big 3 because we're filling units that were empty otherwise. With Sterling, there certainly will be a little bit of drag as we work on the 69 units that we're doing there, but it's going to be pretty immaterial across the broader scope of Aimco. And as we ramp up redevelopment spending away from the big 3 and other projects in the 2015, drag and displacement that something need to talk again but at the dollar amounts we're talking about, it's going to be pretty minimal. I haven't done the math recently. If I'm guessing, it would be no more than $0.01 or $0.02 at the level of spends we're talking about. As we go out we will certainly provide a clear insight to that as we get into 2015.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Finally. Just a question in terms of, you got the portfolio mix of A and B. Can you talk about -- what's the differences between you're seeing in markets where you have both A and B product in terms of pricing? And then also, just in light of jobs report this morning. How sensitive is your rent growth forecast and overall forecast to employment growth?","Ernest M. Freedman","Regarding A and B, I'll let Keith to talk. We have a couple of markets where we do have A and B type of assets combined, a market like Los Angeles. I'll ask Keith to talk about.","Keith M. Kimmel","Michael, we would tell you, we use new lease rates as a barometer to kind of gauge how an A or B product in a similar market. And what we're seeing generally across the board is As and Bs are performing within about 50 basis points of each other.","Ernest M. Freedman","And then, what I would say, Mike, regards to the jobs reports, we go through and put together our guidance and our budgets. We do it from a bottoms up approach in terms of working with our properties and understanding what's happening locally. So certainly national type metrics like jobs reports don't have a lot of impact to what's going to happen on the local scene, it really is going to happen locally with jobs. But for us, we would expect that the economy in the market kind of stays as it is, it's kind of sluggish but slowly growing and slowly improving. We feel pretty -- we feel solid with our numbers that there would be a major black swan type of event or major change in the macroeconomic situation that's starting to impact localities, we have to of course go back and visit, but we think there's a lot of flexibility in our numbers with regards to them and Terry want to add one thing, too.","Terry Considine","Mike, good morning. I think even looking at the jobs report this morning, the economy is getting better. It's choppy, it's not on a tear, but it's getting better. So that's a pretty good condition for us because it keeps things tempered, if you will, it's not running away, it's more steady. The second thing I would call out is that in that economy, there is a -- the people that are better educated and have better jobs are gaining at a faster rate than the average of the economy. And that target customer is exactly where we're going. And to me, the most -- there are a lot of very interesting and exciting and encouraging numbers in our report, both in the earnings release and on the call. But one that just stands out at me, is that the median income of our new customers, this on a same-store basis -- the median income of our new customers in the fourth quarter was 10% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2012. So rents are 10% higher. So the customers\u2019 ability to pay rent has improved year-over-year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I mean, I hope the job environment continues to improve.","Terry Considine","Yes, I hope so.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Harris at Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Terry, I never read you as being someone that naturally runs with the pack. I'm just wondering if how much you see that pursuing focus on many of the same markets of the other public companies selling off the Affordables, and upgrading the portfolio, seeking an investment grade REIT. What opportunities are you missing that you would be doing if you weren't pursuing those strategies?","Terry Considine","David, thank you very much. I don't -- I guess I do think that, in general, a good idea can be overdone and there's some risk in running with the pack. I would like to call out those -- some very important differences between what we're doing in our points of emphasis and what the pack might be doing. And just looking at operations, the one that jumps out is cost control. We have had substantially better cost control than the average of our peers because we've worked very hard at productivity, at job redesign, at technology. Now there are others that are pretty good at it. Our neighbors here in town at UDR have done a wonderful job. But we're the champs. And so, we'll be distinctive in that. The second would be around portfolio management. We will be -- while we admire and appreciate the value of coastal California and of the sexy 6 markets, we don't want to have all our eggs in one basket. I mentioned to Mike, that a great number in the call was this 10% increase in median income of our new customers. But another very interesting fact to me is the rotation in our top-performing markets. So while it's correct that, the Bay Area is a wonderful market for us, so too are Miami and Chicago, which don't show up on other people's portfolio allocations. We want to be more diversified than would be implicit in some of the other strategies.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, I guess one of the observations here, and maybe this is a conversation between you and I as a personal conference call, but is there a public market discount if you pursue different strategies from that which many of the companies that have high prestige and high valuations by becoming sort of me too and yet you sort of cutting off your chance to create value that by not running with the pack?","Terry Considine","I think there is a chance of that. A person has to be sure that the differences are differences that add value. And we're quite comfortable with, for example, our total returns over the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years as compared to any apartment REIT. And so, the only one that would be comparable would be FX [ph] with it's wonderful allocation to the Bay area, but again that's a concentration that we probably would not take on.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Right, right. Okay, well I guess to be continue when I see you next.","Terry Considine","No, I'd look forward to that. But I would just go down again, look at balance sheets. This came up again on the call today where, I think it was Dave Bragg was asking if this meant we're going to be a corporate issuer. I don't think so. I mean, I'd be glad to have all options. But there's an inherent safety in property debt that doesn't get priced in the public market every day, but is quite real. And so, we're going to stay being different in that third area.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, I mean, I'm inclined to agree with you. And I think there's an overvaluation of that, which is plain vanilla by many investors.","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, operator, thank you. And any of our listeners who are still on this call after which has been fairly long, I just want to thank you and appreciate your interest in Aimco. Please call Elizabeth Coalson or Ernie Freedman, or me if you have any questions. And for those whom we'll see in a few weeks at the Citi conference, we look forward to being together.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2016 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted fund from operations and fund from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, our Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations, John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa and good morning to all of you and thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. In property operations, same-store rent per apartment home was up 5.1%, the rate of increase 70 basis points better than the 4.4% growth rate of the first quarter last year.","Operating expenses were essentially flat. With higher rents and flat expenses same-store net operating income was up by more than 7% leading the high end of guidance by 160 basis points making for a good quarter and a solid start to the year.","In redevelopment, ongoing projects are on time, on budget and are creating value equal to $0.25 to $0.35 for each dollar invested. Patty and her team are doing a great job including construction on -- completing construction on the South tower and starting construction on the East tower at Park Town place in Center City, Philadelphia as well as adding to our active redevelopments by starting the final phase that completes redevelopment of The Sterling in Center City, Philadelphia and starting a second phase at Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles.","In portfolio management, first quarter revenue per apartment home was up across the entire Amico portfolio to more than $1,860 an Amico record and up 9% year-over-year.","For these good results I offer sincere congratulations and thanks to my Aimco teammates both here in Denver and across the country. It\u2019s a privilege and a pleasure to work with you. I\u2019m especially proud of your grading Aimco a top workplace in Colorado for a fourth consecutive year.","Now for more detailed report on first quarter operations, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith.","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Terry. We're pleased to report that we had a solid quarter of operations with revenues up 4.8% year-over-year. Expenses were up 10 basis points year-over-year with net operating income up 7.1% for the quarter. Each of these quarter, metrics are better than the first quarter of last year.","In Q1 of 2016, our residence gave us our 10th consecutive quarters better than a Four Star rating in customer satisfaction. This contributed to renewal rent increases of 6% for the quarter, some 120 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2015.","Of note, renewal premiums increased in each successive month of the quarter. We saw particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver and Atlanta. Renewal rents in these markets increased 8% to 9% compared to the expiring leases.","Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new lease pricing outperformed the results from the first quarter of 2015 and for each month of the quarter individually.","This resulted in a quarterly increase in new lease rates of 3.5%, 230 basis points better than last year. The year-over-year rate of growth for new leases was strongest in Boston and Los Angeles.","As a result of our team's hard work, our blended lease rate increases of 4.6% were 180 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year and by a 100 basis points sequentially, all while increasing average daily occupancy for the quarter by 10 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points from fourth quarter.","We\u2019d another solid quarter on the expense front, growing by 10 basis points overall and 2% on excluding the year-over-year decline in utility expense due to a milder winter. Turnover for the quarter was 50.9%. Of the customers who decided to move out 23% were for career moves, 17% did not renew due to price and 14% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.","Our resident quality continues to improve. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was $136,000 with a median income of 95,000.","Year-over-year the median income of our new residents was up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with half coming from a more discriminating application process and half from an improvement of portfolio quality.","Our 12 target market, which represent 90% of same-store net operating income had topline revenue growth up 5.2% in the quarter versus 4.8% for the entire portfolio. Our top performers all had revenue increases in double-digits for more than 10% to better than 13%. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Seattle and Denver.","Our strong performers, which had revenue growth from nearly 6% to better than 7% were Boston, San Diego, Atlanta and Greater Los Angeles. Our steady target markets with about 2.5% to 3% revenue growth were Chicago, New York City and Washington DC. And finally was software revenue growth of around 1% we had Philadelphia and Miami.","As we look to our April month to date results, lender lease rates are up 5%, 10 basis points better than last year. New leases are up 3.6% and renewals are up 6.4%. April's average daily occupancy is at 95.9%, 30 basis points below last year by design.","We've intentionally moved leases from our shorter months into peak leasing season with higher demand. This improvement in expiration management will pay dividends by re-pricing leases in periods of greater expected rent growth.","And finally May and June renewal offers went up with 6% to 8% increases and with great thanks to our teams in the field and hearing Denver for your commitment to Aimco for success.","I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith and good day, everybody. Here I would like to take a few minutes to review our recent investment and portfolio activities. During the first quarter, we invested $31 million in redevelopment, $9 million of it on our redevelopment pipeline and $22 million of Park Towne Place and The Sterling both located in Center City, Philadelphia.","At Park Towne Place, we completed redevelopment of the South Tower and the Town Center. 91% of the 224 completed apartment homes in the South Tower at least and rents are ahead of underwriting. Construction is progressing as planned on East Tower with delivering the first redeveloped apartment homes coming this summer.","Sterling leasing results are encouraging as we continue to see strong demand. We also continued our Phase redevelopment of The Sterling with 95% of the 283 completed apartment homes leased at rents above underwriting.","Patty and her team continue plan our next round of redevelopment and as Terry mentioned, we're continuing that redevelopment at The Sterling and Pallazo Park, La Brea.","At The Sterling, the final phase of redevelopment includes 125 apartment homes on seven floors and the build out of the retail space. The incremental cost of this work is approximately $22 million.","We're also moving forward on the continued redevelopment of Pallazo Park, La Brea property in Los Angeles. This phase will upgrade 389 apartment homes in the accompanying common areas. The incremental investment there is approximately $24 million with Aimco's share about $30 million.","During the first quarter, we also invested $16 million in the construction of our One Canal development project in Boston. We anticipate receiving our initial temporary Certificate of Occupancy for the building within the new few days and our first move ins are scheduled for Mid-way.","Today 12% of the 310 apartment homes have been leased and rents there are also above underwriting.","In addition to One Canal we have three other properties undergoing lease up; Axiom, Vivo and Indigo, and we're on track at each. Our lease-up of Axiom and Vivo, the properties that we acquired last year Cambridge is progressing well.","Axiom, which acquired in construction completion last April is now 92% leased and Vivo which we completed construction on in October is 75% leased. Rents and lease space at both properties are exceeding our underwriting.","At Indigo and Redwood City, California, construction continues on plan. We're under contract to purchase this property on construction completion and anticipate closing the acquisition before our next call. We've commenced leasing at this property and at least 9% of the 463 apartment homes are also at rent in excess of our underwriting.","On the disposition side, we sold one conventional property during the first quarter for $10 million in gross proceeds. We continue to expect to execute the bulk of our property sales in the second and fourth quarter as we match fund our planned investment activities.","We don\u2019t normally talk about our sales activity prior to closing, many of you are aware that our buyer on Riverside, Washington REIT disclosed transaction details on their call yesterday. We can confirm the details as disclosed by them and anticipate closing of this transaction during the second quarter. The proceeds on the sale of Riverside will complete the funding of our Indigo acquisition.","With that I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks John. I will start today with first quarter 2016 results.","At $0.51 per share, AFFO was up 11% year-over-year and $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Pro forma FFO of $0.57 per share was up 10% year-over-year and $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range.","First quarter AFFO outperformance of $0.05 per share was driven by $0.02 from same-store net operating income outperformance 210 basis points, $0.01 from a timing of income tax related items and $0.02 from the timing of capital replacement spending. These positive first quarter results we're increasing full year AFFO and pro forma FFO guidance by $0.01 per share at their respective midpoints.","This increase reflects one, the turnaround of first quarter\u2019s $0.03 outperformance related to the timing items I just mentioned and two, the recognition of $0.01 of the first quarter\u2019s $0.02 of same-store NOI outperformance.","I would like to be clear here. We do not see a slowdown in business compared to our beginning of year expectations. However, we do prefer to take a conservative approach to raising guidance and until we have more visibility into peak leasing season.","On last night\u2019s release, we also established second quarter AFFO guidance of $0.45 to $0.49 per share and pro forma FFO guidance of $0.54 to $0.58 per share.","Shifting gears to our operations related guidance. We're increasing our same-store NOI growth guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. This increase reflects a 75 basis point decrease in projected operating expense growth.","Our guidance for full year same-store revenue growth is unchanged at 4.75% at the midpoint. With last night\u2019s release, we also establish guidance for second quarter same-store NOI growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, which is consistent with the expectations we had for the quarter when we started the year.","Now is then we expect to see continued solid rent growth with the year-over-year comparison for the quarter affected by two items, first as Keith mentioned we have undertaken to reduce a number of lease expirations occurring in off peak months and to drive more leasing volume into peak season where we expect greater pricing power.","The increased number of lease expirations will increase frictional vacancy during the second quarter reducing average daily occupancy by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015 and also increasing turnover expenses.","While these costs are expected to be reversed and rewarded in other quarters, in the second quarter they are expected to reduce year-over-year, same-store NOI growth by approximately 100 basis points.","Second, our second quarter expense growth last year was actually negative as a result of non-routine items in 2015. So while we expect to low expense growth in this year, we also expect faster expense growth in this quarter.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I will turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I just wanted to start on the shifting of the leases and the lease optimization. What drove the decision to do that this year? And will it be complete in terms of the allocation for each quarter to where you would like to see it after 2016?","Keith Kimmel","Hey Nick, it\u2019s Keith Kimmel. I'll take it. Let me walk with a broader overview of the objective and then talk about what we did. When we look at the first and fourth quarter, we believe having 20% of our expiring leases in each of those quarters is where we would like to be and then putting the balance or 60% in the second and third quarters.","A year ago we moved roughly 2,000 units from the shouldering quarters and them put them into the second and third quarter, essentially so we could take advantage of peak season and essentially some of the slowdowns that you can see in pricing and demand in particularly November, December things like that.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just I guess larger picture, we're seeing two of your peers now do larger portfolio sales and return capital through special dividends. What percentage of your portfolio do you consider non-core today and is that something you would be interested in doing just given the strong private market pricing?","Terry Considine","Nick this is Terry and there is -- 10% of our portfolio is in the bottom 10%. So it's question for what's non-core. It's a question of what the use of proceeds would be. So that's a little bit difficult to describe specifically. The no assets that we own that we don\u2019t appreciate owning and there is no asset that we own that in time will be ready for sale.","The second question about special dividends is one that we've focused on and discussed with our larger shareholders and our view is that they want us to continue to be invested in the apartment business that we serve in allocation for them and what they expect us to focus on running apartments cutting the grass.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just finally in terms of the Indigo, I recognize it's only 9% of leases but could you talk about how far ahead of underwriting you are?","Terry Considine","John was there yesterday, John?","John Bezzant","Yes I would say the -- so leasing at this point obviously is very early days. I don't want to give you a precise number but its mid-single digits of our underwriting where we\u2019re at today.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about the performance of your assets, the A assets versus the B\/C assets, how they have been trending from a growth standpoint?","Keith Kimmel","Nick, Keith Kimmel. I will walk you through it. First let me start with that we think using new lease pricing is the best parameter as we look across how they are performing and if we look at our 12 target markets what we've seen in this past quarter is nine out of the 12 saw that Bs were outperforming the As.","Nick Yulico","Okay, which are the ones where the Bs are not outperforming the As?","Keith Kimmel","Sure Nick. Let me walk through this, a couple of unique things in those three. First Washington DC in which we have one single building in the district where we have an excessive operating team there that had an outperformance.","In the Bay Area, we have a single building that outperformed into the Pacific Bay business, our redevelopment that we did a few years back that is extremely well located and has really done well. And then the third is Chicago in which both our As and Bs are almost on top of each other, our As is nudge them out probably about 10 basis points so very, very close.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a question on the Indigo project. When it comes -- when you actually buy the project, how does that work from an accounting standpoint? Is there any third quarter capitalized interest or expense benefit that you start getting for FFO?","Paul Beldin","No Nick as we -- this is Paul, thank you for the question. Once we take control and acquired Indigo here in the next few months the impact will be it's an asset on our books and since all the units are available and ready to be leased, there is no capitalization of cost other than what you would typically capitalize in operating property and to the extent there is construction activities.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks Paul.","Operator","The next question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi guys, it's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. I was just curious with the plans to move out some expirations, what's your loss to lease today across the portfolio?","Keith Kimmel","Austin this is Keith, I'll take it. It\u2019s actually 7% and it\u2019s increased about 1.8% from the fourth quarter, which really just demonstrates the fact that we have more pricing power.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for that. And I was just curious with the strength and acceleration you've seen in your markets as well as at the lease-up properties. Have you guys considered accelerating your redevelopment program?","Terry Considine","Austin, this is Terry Considine. We are comfortable with our pace in redevelopment. Patty has a deep pipeline and it's conceivable it could increase somewhat. But these are long term projects. They have a fair amount of lead time and we're comfortable running out.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks. And last one for me. On the occupancy decline as you move those out, would you expect to make up that occupancy later in the year as you start to release some of those units?","Paul Beldin","Yeah, Austin this is Paul, as we look at our plan for the year, in our prepared remarks we mentioned that occupancy was up in the first quarter of this year over last year. That is attributable to in part few release expirations in the first quarter and we would expect to see a benefit in the fourth quarter as well.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","The next question is from John Kim at BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thanks, good morning. Terry, I think in the last call you said Redwood City, your assets in that market had gone up 10% in the fourth quarter and 5% in January. Can you provide an update on that for the first quarter?","Terry Considine","John, I'm happy to and my crack team tells me that those four properties were up by 8% in the first quarter. So the four properties nearest to Indigo that are owned and operated by Aimco was up -- revenue was up 8% year-over-year in the first quarter. Is that right Paul?","Paul Beldin","That is correct.","Terry Considine","There you go.","John Kim","Okay. And then conversely you mentioned a softer growth that you're seeing in Philadelphia and Miami. What is this attributable to, particularly Philadelphia because there doesn't seem to be that much new construction?","Terry Considine","Keith, do you want to take that.","Keith Kimmel","Sure, yeah. John, let me just I think qualify the Philadelphia portfolio that represents the stuff here. This is not Center City, Philadelphia. When we think about the tours that we had at Sterling and Park Towne, this is our suburban markets that are outside of the City and Germantown and places like that in which it's really not what we would consider Center City, Philadelphia. So it's different marketplace.","John Kim","So Center City itself what do you think.","Terry Considine","Center City is doing great. I don't know if we have River Loft readily available, but most of our Center City assets are out of same-store, because they're in redevelopment at Park Towne and Sterling.","That River Loft was up by 4% in the quarter and the assets that are included under the Philadelphia heading in there that Keith mentioned are in Levittown and places like that, not representative of our core portfolio or whole portfolio.","Miami, you also asked about and Keith you could speak to that. But the Miami numbers are influenced in very specific cases, our three largest properties there which are Flamingo, Yacht Club and Bay Park, each have a nearby adjacent construction, disruptions of one degree or another and it's not necessarily representative of the market.","John Kim","Okay. Thank you","Operator","The next question is from Jana Galan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jana Galan","Thank you. Keith, I just wanted to follow up on your comment about initiating a more discriminating application process. I'm curious how you changed income qualification, when you started to do it, and what was the reason? Were you seeing any increase in delinquencies?","Keith Kimmel","So Jana thanks for that question. It's something that we do on a regular bases, over the past many years, it's something we review. But what we really saw as an opportunity to really just be pushing our credit scores in income qualifications in a variety of those different things in which we're just -- we're just being a little bit stricter.","We know that at the end of the day that we have a responsibility that we help pick the neighbors that live in our communities and we want to take a more concerted effort to even push further.","Jana Galan","And any change in the delinquencies?","Keith Kimmel","No we're not really seeing anything. When we look at our bad debt our bad debt typically runs in the 30 to 40 basis points of total revenue and so we're not seeing anything that would be really different there. It's just an opportunity we want to continue to tighten our belt and just get better at it.","Jana Galan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Stevenson at Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon guys. Keith, can you talk about your DC submarkets? Numbers look pretty good both sequentially and year-over-year. Where are you seeing the greatest pockets of strength, and where is the more challenging parts of the portfolio in greater DC for you?","Keith Kimmel","We got it Rob. Let me walk through it. We continue to see recovery and in fact acceleration. When we look at our revenue being up 2.4% this past quarter was also better sequentially. And really where we sit, we're in Suburban Virginia at the Alexandrian market and of course Maryland.","What we've seen is that the Suburban Virginia outperformed Maryland in this quarter and more importantly did it also in the fourth quarter of last year, which was the first time we had seen that. So where we have 4,000 units there's a majority of our portfolio in Alexandria Area and it's been outperforming and we're seeing a better performance there.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then in terms of the pushing the lease expirations, are you guys adding additional staffing to handle the leasing and the turnover, make ready costs, or your existing staff just gutting it out?","Keith Kimmel","Rob. This is Keith, I will take it again. One of the things that we have been focused on for many years is matching our staffing levels with the demand of the business and so we've done this over the years. It's been an area in which we have been able to take advantage of really matching when you have those ebbs and flows.","And so what I would tell you is in January of this year and at the end of last year when I was getting the team together, we had a very focused effort on -- the peak season is going to come earlier. However, get to staff up and it's not just our own staffing, it's vendors, it's a variety of other folks in which we get well prepared so that we could really take advantage of it and not be in a position that seems like you're caught off guard, but in fact it's all by plan and by design.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And anything too -- if I look, the only market you had negative quarter-over-quarter revenue, negative revenue growth was New York. Anything to take out of that, is it one asset? Are you starting to see trends in New York area?","Keith Kimmel","Rob. It\u2019s Keith, I\u2019ll take it again. First of all let's just be on the same page it's 500 units. Most of them are walk ups. We had one building in Chelsea that had a little bit of a more difficult quarter. But there I wouldn't take any signs of it that anything unique is going on.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Rich Anderson at Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good afternoon. So you mentioned on the lease optimization process, is there any cost to that in terms of making a deal with people or whatever to shift into the second and third quarter? And is there anymore of it to do?","Keith Kimmel","Rich. It\u2019s Keith. Let me help you think about it, first of all there's no cost to it. Essentially what happens is that we have a professional deputy management team that works in house and essentially when we're sending out renewal offers, what we're able to do is we're able to stagger and offer different extensions and lengths in order to match up so that we get those leases to get renewed and\/or new leases the match up into these new periods of time.","So from that standpoint, there's really no difference in the way that our cost associated with it it's more about just walking through the process and ensuring we match it up that way.","Rich Anderson","I'm sorry, I'm still here. Hello? Sorry I had a little disruption there. And if I could have a quick question, follow-up question unrelated, you mentioned I think Keith you said Philly was at the low end of your range in terms of how markets are performing yet you're doing a fair amount of redevelopment there.","I'm curious how you feel about that and do you have an eye towards Philly becoming a much better market, it's that why you're developing there or is it turning against you a little bit?","Keith Kimmel","Rich. This is Keith. I'll take the first stab at it and then I can ask John or to anybody who wants to add in. First of all just to be on the same page the Philadelphia market that we're seeing, that's not performing at the same levels as some of the others is outside of Center City and when we look at the redevelopments that we're doing at Park Towne and Sterling and Center City, there's not anything that's better located in those buildings and all of Philadelphia.","And in fact those are being received and leased up above our expectation and I would just tell you that we would not change the way we're thinking about that in any way.","John Bezzant","You have to double down on a little bit. If you recall the conservation back in October, the Investor Day, Philadelphia, for us long term in the portfolio is Center City in our own lease Center City assets that in the same story today is River Loft that had 4% growth and so we would not consider it to be lighter within the portfolio at all. We have high hopes and high prospectus for Center City ","Rich Anderson","Got you. Thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Next question is from Connor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.","Connor Wagner","Good afternoon. What is the outlook for LA and specifically in Venice? How is that performing and will it be impacted by supply this year?","Keith Kimmel","Connor its Keith, let me take a stab at it and then I\u2019ll ask if anybody wants give additional insight. When we look at LA, we think LA is going to be one of top performers. It fell in our strong performers in my prepared remarks.","The bottom line is that when we look at it our West LA or Mid-Wilshire portfolio is some of the best located communities on all of Los Angeles and we continue to see LA perform well.","As we look at our property in Venice the Lincoln property, it continues to perform better than our plans, continues to stay highly occupied and great absorption and great focus as the customers in that area are really enjoying it.","John Bezzant","Connor, this is John. One thing I would remind you on Venice in particular is that that product at Lincoln place is very different than any of the new supply that\u2019s going to come into the market and we feel very good about its positioning and relation to new supply whether it comes in Marina or elsewhere.","Connor Wagner","Great, thank you, John, and a follow-up for you. Have you seen any slowdown in Fannie and Freddie's activity in specifically in some of the lower quality assets that you're looking to sell?","John Bezzant","None whatsoever.","Connor Wagner","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Wes Golladay at RBC Capital markets.","Wes Golladay","Hello, everyone. I just want to get a little clarification on the lease expiration movement. Did you say you moved 2,000 last year; and if so, what is the number this year that you're looking to move?","Keith Kimmel","Wes, its Keith. It was 2,000 last year that we reorganized into 2016, what I would say is I think that as we look from our 2016 activity into '17, it would be lesser -- that would be less of that, very minimal. But it\u2019s an area that we constantly look at and constantly look at how we can fine-tune it and make it even better. Paul, anything you want to add to that?","Paul Beldin","Yes Wes, one point I would add as you think about those 2,000 expirations that were moved into peak leasing season, we see those pretty evenly split between the second and third quarters.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And what kind of lift do you think that does for overall same-store revenue? You had a little bit of a net effect this year where you're going to have a little bit of a headwind; but the ones from last year, how much of a benefit is that for you guys.","Paul Beldin","Well as we look at it, it's little bit tough to predict at this point in time just because we\u2019re not quite into peak leasing season and we\u2019re not quite sure of the rates that we would ultimately achieve. But if were to look at the lease spreads last year between the second quarter and the fourth quarter, there is about 180, 200 basis points spread on a blended basis between the rates in those two periods.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then looking at Alexandria, what is driving the acceleration there? Is it incremental demand or just less supply?","Keith Kimmel","Wes, I will take it, I think you're seeing some of that supply as being absorbed and the market is also just stabilizing to a certain extent.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Thank you, operator. And thanks to all of you for your interest in Aimco. We look forward to seeing a great many of you in New York in June for REIT week, in the meantime if you have any questions please call Elizabeth Coalson, Paul Beldin or me, and we\u2019ll do our best to answer them.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2018 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, Executive Vice President, in charge of Redevelopment, John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our CFO. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I'll now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good and Aimco had another solid quarter. In property operations, revenue was up. In same store, which is about 2\/3 of our portfolio, occupancy was up 40 basis points year-over-year to 96.3% due to customer retention reaching above 54%.","As Keith and his team continue to focus on customer selection and satisfaction. Their laser focus on profitability drove a free cash flow margin of 68% and a remarkable net operating income margin approaching 74%. In the remaining 1\/3 of our portfolio, which includes our redevelopment and the newly acquired properties, leasing and occupancy were also good, meeting or exceeding underwriting.","In redevelopment, Wes and his team have kept our current projects on time, on budget and on track to be highly accretive to net asset value. This line of business has been particularly profitable, creating on average $0.40 to net asset value for every dollar that we've invested over the past five years. We now plan to increase the rate of redevelopment spending beginning with adding the next phase at the Anschutz Medical Campus. ","In portfolio management, we continue our disciplined capital allocation via paired trades focusing not on short-term earnings but rather long-term value creation as measured by net asset value per share. Some of you may recall our decision in 2011 to exit the Affordable business over time. With the last week's sale of the asset management portfolio and Hunters Point communities, led by John Bezzant and Lynn Stanfield, we have done just what we said we'd do. Simplify Aimco's business model and extract full value for our Affordable assets.","Over the same seven years, we have also executed consistently the other elements of our business plan. Substantially improving our continuing businesses, all while maintaining a portfolio diversified by geography and by price point. Since that time, we have sold properties worth $4.2 billion and reinvested a majority of the sales proceeds in higher quality properties with greater expected rent growth and higher free cash flow internal rates of return.","Along the way, we more than doubled average monthly revenue per apartment home to approximately $2,100 a month and increased net operating income margin to more than 70%. We reduced leverage by $1.8 billion and built a $2 billion pool of unencumbered properties, providing access to liquidity as opportunities may arise.","We more than doubled the net asset value per share to $54. And while doing all of this, we are named one of the top workplaces in Colorado for 6 years straight. Going forward, we expect more of the same and work every day to get better and better. For these many successes and for our promising prospects, I offer great thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver and across the country. You've worked hard and achieved much. Thank you.","And now, for a more detailed report on the second quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid second quarter in operations, with same-store revenues up 3.2% for the quarter. We had a purposeful strategy, driving average daily occupancy, and we finished at 96.3% in the second quarter, 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2017. This improved occupancy is a result of our key operational strengths. We continue to provide exceptional customer service. Residents gave us better than 4 stars for the 19th consecutive quarter with 4.23 out of 5 stars.","These highly satisfied customers live with us significantly longer. Additionally, our focus on resident selection has led to a low turnover of 45.4% for the quarter, 270 basis points better than the second quarter 2017. And finally, we're preleasing more apartment homes. In June, nearly 50% of our apartments were leased before the previous resident moved out. A significant improvement from 30% last June.","Moving on from revenue. Expenses were up 3.3%, of which, 60 basis points is due to a 2017 adjustment to our insurance reserves that did not recur. Controllable operating expenses were up 2.6% with declining labor costs, offset by increased repair and maintenance costs as we continue to invest in our communities. The combination of 3.2% revenue growth and 3.3% expense growth led to 3.2% growth in net operating income. Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter, new leases were up 1.9%. Renewal rents had solid increases of 4.8% and same-store blended lease rates were up 3.4%. We saw new lease rates of 4% to 5% in Miami, the Bay Area and San Diego with the most pressure on new lease rates in Seattle and Atlanta.","Turning to the second quarter same-store revenue growth. Our top performers, representing more than half of our same-store portfolio, had revenue increases over 4% for the quarter. This includes Boston, the Bay Area, San Diego, Denver and Los Angeles. Our solid performance, which had revenue growth of 1% to 3% were Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.","New York, Philadelphia and Seattle were all flat to a negative revenue growth for the quarter and in total, these markets represent less than 6% of our same-store revenue. Our substantial nonsame-store portfolio continues to be strong. In Philadelphia, The Sterling is highly occupied with rates in line with our plan. The first three towers of Park Towne are about 90% occupied, and while construction of the fourth and final tower is still underway, we've already moved in more than 120 residents, reached 50% occupancy and preleased 65% of our homes all ahead of schedule.","Turning to acquisitions. We're pleased with the progress of our 4 new communities in Philadelphia, thanks to both our veteran Aimco teammates and new team members who have navigated this transition successfully. As we have achieved occupancy above plan and rents in line with underwriting. In Washington, D.C., we continued to be encouraged by the performance at Bent Tree, which is 98% occupied today with new lease rates in excess of underwriting. And as we look at our July same-store results, we see a solid start to the third quarter with the continuation of strong average daily occupancy and new lease rates. Average daily occupancy for July was 96%. New lease rates were up 2.5%. Renewals up 4.1% and blended lease rates were up 3.4%.","Finally, August and September, renewal offers went down with 4% to 6% increases. And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success, I'll turn the call over to Wes Powell, our Executive Vice President of Redevelopment, Wes?","Wesley Powell","Thank you, Keith. As you just heard, we had a solid quarter in operations. At our redevelopments, some portion of those good results can be attributed to Aimco's focus on actively managing the inventory of renovated apartments, ensuring that we match supply with demand to limit downtime and maximize pricing power. To that end, Keith and his team have leased over 96% of the redeveloped homes that have been delivered year-to-date at rates in line with our projections.","On the construction front. Our projects remain on time and on budget. At Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia, we are nearing the end of construction on our fourth and final tower. As Keith noted, our lease up is ahead of schedule, and we remain focused on reaching a stabilized occupancy across all 4 towers. With the completion of Phase 3 development of Park Towne along with The Sterling, also located in Center City, who represent the culmination of over $250 million of net investment including the lease up of over 1,400 homes and the creation of $100 million in asset value.","Some of you may remember when we hosted our Investor Day in Philadelphia 3 years ago, to showcase our plans and early work on these properties. We are pleased to have executed on the vision we outlined at that time, and my thanks go out to a host of Aimco teammates for their dedication to the success of these transformative projects. In Boulder, Colorado, construction at Parc Mosaic remains on track, with preleasing schedule to begin during the fourth quarter of this year and initial occupancies expected next summer.","Looking ahead, we're excited by both the depth and quality of our redevelopment pipeline. As highlighted in our earnings release, we are pleased to announce our plans to develop a new community located within the Anschutz Medical Campus here in Denver and immediately adjacent to our existing 21 Fitzsimons property. The campus includes the University of Colorado Medical Center, Children's Hospital Colorado, and the recently completed, Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center. This burgeoning 500-acre life science and innovation hub is home to 25,000 jobs today and that number is projected to nearly double over the next dozen years.","In 2017, we entered into an option agreement providing us the exclusive right to purchase four land parcels surrounding our 21 Fitzsimons property. These parcels represent the only land zoned for multifamily development on the Anschutz Campus and can accommodate up to 850 apartments at full buildout. This initial phase will include 253 homes, a 225 space parking garage, 4,600 square feet of ground-level retail. We expect to break ground during Q4 pending our closing on the land later this month with delivery scheduled for 2020. ","Our ownership and operation of the neighboring 21 Fitzsimons property, which contains 600 apartments provided valuable insights into our underwriting and operating efficiencies that will allow for improved operating margins. We project the $87 million investment will result in an NOI yield in the low 6s upon stabilization and produce a free cash flow unlevered IRR greater than 10%.","Next, with an update on portfolio management, I'll turn it over to John Bezzant, Aimco's Chief Investment Officer, John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Wes. We had a busy few months on the transactions' front. As mentioned on our previous call, we closed on the purchase of 4 communities in Philadelphia on May 1. Subsequent activities have completed the paired trade for these communities and Bent Tree in Northern Virginia. We acquired Bent Tree in February 2018 for a total consideration of $160 million. We invested another $308 million on the initial 4 Philadelphia communities. Paid for these investments, we've issued $65 million of OP units at $53 per share to the Philadelphia seller. Assumes $209 million of debt on the Philadelphia communities, sold our asset management business and the Hunters Point communities for gross proceeds of $590 million, and sold Chestnut Hill village, a C+ rated property in suburban Philadelphia for cash of $170 million.","These paired trade activities result in a more focused Aimco business, an update to our Philadelphia and D.C. portfolios. Through acquisitions, we anticipate will yield a free cash flow internal rate of return, 400 basis points higher than the dispositions made to fund them. And we generated additional cash for the deleveraging, Paul will discuss in a few minutes.","We have two additional Philadelphia area assets under contract with Carl E. Dranoff. The closing of the Camden property is conditioned upon city of Camden approval of the transfer of the existing pilot tax agreement, which has not yet been received. And One Ardmore Place in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, is still under construction and remains on track for acquisition upon its completion in the first half of 2019. We expect to start preleasing on this community before the end of the year.","And as Terry noted, the exit of our Affordable business and the reinvestment of its proceeds over the past several years has been transformational for Aimco. The successful execution of this strategy was the result of hard work by individuals too numerous to name, but I would like to take a moment to thank all of those who made it happen. I'm grateful to have been surrounded throughout this process by talented, passionate people, who stayed focused on their job at hand amidst this change.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks, John. First, I would like to cover our financial results for the second quarter. AFFO per share of $0.54 was up 6% year-over-year and $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of guidance. $0.01 of the outperformance is due to stronger than anticipated performance in property operations including the contribution from our newly acquired communities. The other $0.03 is due to timing-related items, which we expect to reverse later this year.","Next, onto our balance sheet which keeps getting stronger. It has been a time of significant improvement for Aimco's balance sheet with the proceeds from the transactional activities that John discussed, we were able to pay off our entire $250 million term loan, repaid all outstanding amounts borrowed on our line of credit and hold additional cash, which will be used to unencumber 5 communities during the second half of the year, thereby increasing our unencumbered pool to $2.4 billion at year-end.","We were also able to preserve our in-place below market debt previously collateralized by Chestnut Hill Village by transferring the $73 million mortgage to another property by substituting the collateral and maintaining this debt at an interest cost of 3% until its maturity in 2024, we are able to save approximately $4 million in future interest costs.","As we enter the second half of 2018, we are now turning our attention to 2019 maturities. $250 million, of which, or about 50% are able to be refinanced in the fourth quarter. Based on today's interest rates and spreads, refinancing these loans would lower our weighted average interest rate by about 10 basis points, thereby creating more than $3 million of prospective annual interest savings. ","Also, on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $7.6 million of OP units at a weighted average 20% discount to our published net asset value.","Finally, turning to full year guidance. As Keith described, our same-store properties performed well during the first 6 months, exceeding our expectations in average daily occupancy and blended rent growth. We expect 2018 average daily occupancy to be between 96.1% and 96.4%, up at the midpoint from 96.1% in 2017 and better than our guidance at the start of the year.","With 70% of our 2018 leasing activity now complete, we expect blended rent growth this year of approximately 3%, up from 2.5% in 2017 and a 50 basis point improvement from our view at the beginning of the year.","We expect 2018 customer retention to be 55%, up from 53% in 2017 with a corresponding reduction in fees and other income earned, when our resident moves out and her apartment home is rerented. That lost fee revenue is more than offset by avoided turn cost and vacancy loss and by higher rents achieved on renewal leases as compared to new leases.","Taking into account, our year-to-date results and expectations for the balance of the year, we narrowed 2018 same-store revenue guidance to a range of 2.5% to 3%, increasing the low end of the range by 40 basis points and the midpoint by 15 basis points. The net effect of greater-than-anticipated blended rent growth and lower turnover is a 15 basis point increase in expected 2018 revenue growth.","The primary variable to 2018 revenue growth is average daily occupancy in the second half of the year. For example, the midpoint of guidance is reached with second half ADO of 96%, a level we feel will be comfortably achieved. And the high end of guidance is accomplished with second half ADO of 96.4%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first half of the year.","Given the increase to same-store revenue guidance and no change to the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance, we increased same-store NOI guidance by 20 basis points at the midpoint to 2.2% to 3%. We also updated our expectations for full year FFO and AFFO, narrowing the respective guidance ranges by $0.02, while maintaining the midpoints established at the end of the first quarter.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Roco, I'll turn it to you for the next question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Juan Sanabria","Maybe just starting off with Paul. You mentioned a couple of timing adjustments that helped out the FFO results for the second quarter versus your expectations. Could you just elaborate on that, what line items kind of moved around in terms of timing?","Paul Beldin","You bet, Juan, I'd be happy to. At the AFFO line, $0.03 of our $0.04 of outperformance to our midpoint was timing related, as you noted. $0.02 of those is related to the timing of our capital replacement spending, where we have some projects that just slipped from an expected completion in the second quarter to the third quarter. And the remaining $0.01 is due to, and this occurs to FFO, is due to timing of our tax benefit and how that's being recognized throughout the year, the cumulative amount is the same for the full year. There are just some that was accelerated into Q2.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, great. And then just on the same-store revenue guide, can you give us any color on, which markets are leading the increase to '18 expectations and which are lagging at this point?","Keith Kimmel","Juan, it's Keith, I'll take it. The markets, I would say, that are leading are the Bay Area, for sure, has been an outperformer from where we had started at the beginning of the year thinking about it. Also, I'd put Los Angeles and Boston in that category. Atlanta has been a little tougher than we thought as an example. But I'd point to the Bay Area, Boston and L.A. as the big ones.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And do you think the Bay Area occupancy growth is sustainable?","Keith Kimmel","Well, I don't see anything that would make me think otherwise. At the moment, when we went into the beginning of the year, last year end of '17, it was a little sluggish, and so we saw some acceleration and we've seen it be particularly good, as we look at where our portfolio lies in Redwood City, in San Mateo, in San Bruno, the Pacific has some very specific places in the peninsula that are really special. And so there's nothing at the moment that would make me think differently, but I don't want to get ahead of myself.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just want to touch a little bit on the other income piece, it looked like that was a big driver of the acceleration you saw on same-store revenue growth yet, you're expecting that to be, I guess, a lower contribution to overall revenue growth. So can you just give us some color as to what drove that, and how we should be thinking about it through the back half of the year?","Paul Beldin","Yes, Austin, this is Paul, I'll start then I will see if Keith has anything to add. Year-over-year in the second quarter, other income was up just under $500,000 and that's been driven by 3 primary functions. One, Keith and the team have done an incredible job of continuing to help us maximize our parking revenue as well as our opportunities to generate fee from customers who have pets and so that is a big contributor. And the other contributors is continued as lower bad debt, which is also a testament to Keith and the team, where during the second quarter, our bad debt express as a percentage of revenue, was only 11 basis points. And so we're off to a great start to the year on that and we'll continue to work to do better.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then should we expect that to continue to grow at that pace?","Paul Beldin","At that 5% pace that was up in Q2? No, for the full year, we expect other income to be slightly below the growth of the full year -- full year rental revenue, excuse me, sorry for being unclear.","Austin Wurschmidt","No, that's all right. So you expect blended rates essentially to moderate seasonally from the 3.4% achieved be consistent with what you did in the first half and then kind of a stable occupancy. Is that summarized appropriately?","Paul Beldin","Yes. Just to restate it, we expect that year-to-date, our blended raise rates were -- are 3.1%, they were 3.4% in the second quarter. We expect normal seasonality as we go through the remainder of the year and that would result in full year expected 2018 blended lease rates of 3%. So just 10 bps lower than where we are year-to-date. And then our contribution from other income is a little bit lower than we expected at the beginning of the year. And so then the only really remaining variable is average daily occupancy. And so, as I outlined in my remarks if our ADO for the second half is 96%, we end up at about the midpoint and if it's 96.4%, we're at the high end of the range. And just for reference, we're at 96.3% for the first half.","Austin Wurschmidt","And I appreciate that. And then just bigger picture, as you guys kind of talked about at the beginning of the call, you've done a lot of work refining the portfolio for some time now. And I'm just curious what the next area or segment of the portfolio that strategically or economically could make sense to focus on, either from an incremental investment perspective or perhaps maybe something in that other real estate category. How are you think about the portfolio today?","Terry Considine","Austin, this is Terry. And thank you for the question. As we look forward, we expect more of the same. And we expect our results in the next seven years to reflect the same strategy that drove the outsized returns of the past seven years. One addition to that will be that we expect to ramp-up redevelopment spending, as Wes mentioned in his remarks. From the existing level, which has been about $200 million a year to perhaps $300 million a year.","Austin Wurschmidt","That's helpful, and maybe to put a little finer point on it, is there anything else in the other real estate category that you look at as being noncore and potentially a source to fund redevelopment going forward? Or other investment initiatives?","Terry Considine","Austin, again, thank you. Exactly right. We will go through our portfolio and even though it's much improved over the last several years, 10% of it is in the bottom decile, it's tautological. And we will look for the weaker properties that might yield an attractive cost of capital and see if we can reinvest them in better location with better properties.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","Terry, I appreciate the report card on the results of the strategic plan since 2011. You mentioned that NAV per share has more than doubled. When you run the analysis, how much of the change is the result of cap rate compression versus capital allocation decisions?","Terry Considine","Nick, I don't have that right at hand, I apologize for that. I think you're certainly correct to point out that we've had a favorable environment, and we'll calculate that and get it right back to you. It will be a contributor but it will be by no means decisive as to the improvement.","Nicholas Joseph","Appreciate that. And then just, for the Medical Campus development, what's the timing on the remaining 600 units or your hold options on the land and then what's the expected total cost?","Terry Considine","Nick, again, I'd like to answer that because I want to throw a bouquet to John Bezzant. John negotiated those options a couple of years ago. And their term is tied to the rate of job growth on campus. And so that we have no pressure or incentive to get ahead of the expected mushrooming of employment on the campus, and as that job goes -- increases, we see an opportunity to build out our footprint there.","Nicholas Joseph","How long do the options last for?","Paul Beldin","10 years.","Terry Considine","10 years.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Robert Stevenson","On Page 4 of the earnings supplement, you guys segment out your portfolio into the A, B and C+ buckets. Can you talk about how each of those buckets performed during the second quarter and year-to-date? Is the 50% that's represented by A underperforming any material way, given the competition from new supply?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, it's Keith. We think that the best perimeter that we look at is new lease pricing when we look at how things are performing currently. There's been about 100 basis point spread as we look over this last quarter between As and Bs and Bs were performing. Now with that being said, one of the things I'd point out is that really is market dependent. So as an example, in Los Angeles, our As were outperforming our Bs this last quarter. In contrary to that, Boston, we saw our Bs outperform the As. So it really does become very market specific and it becomes very geographically dependent. And that's really how we've seen it over the past quarter here.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then D.C, what level of traction are you guys seeing in that market. I mean, it seems like that things are better than they have been but still not anywhere near as good as they've been in years past before all the supplies started coming in. Are we starting to get towards the end of that? Are you guys seeing greater traction this time of the year this year than you did last year? Or is it just more of the same?","Keith Kimmel","Rob, it's Keith. I'll walk through that. What I'd say is we're seeing some stabilization. Where our portfolio is in suburban Maryland, in suburban Virginia, the Alexandria area. Over multiple quarters over the past 2 years, I've talked about, one might be up and one might be down, and what we've seen in this last quarter is both of them being quite similar. While we're not seeing a rocketing of acceleration, we're seeing some stabilization there. So we're looking forward to the days that we see some really strong growth. At the time, I would say that it seems like it's stabilizing.","Operator","And our next question is from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","Paul, I'll start with you. We started this conversation a little earlier today but can you kind of explain to me the asset management number getting what effectively $6 million more in asset management income, despite the fact that you closed the sale of it in July. It seems like a kind of a chunky number relative to what you did in the past, first half of the year.","Paul Beldin","You bet, Rich. I appreciate the question. And as you correctly point out, our contribution from asset management in the first 6 months of the year was about $16 million. We expect the full year contribution to be $22 million. So there is a pickup in the run rate for our 1 month of ownership. And really the contributing factor that provides the disproportionate impact is a function of how the tax credit business operates. As we operate that business, we had a recorded obligation on our books to deliver future tax credits to the investors, and in connection with the sale that John and Lynn successfully negotiated and closed, we're able to transfer this obligation to deliver these future tax credits at a price below our liability, and so that is going to result in an incremental amount of tax credit income recognized in the third quarter.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Okay, so it's tax credit, using -- you're going to changing the tax credit and asset management line, is that correct?","Paul Beldin","The asset management business is comprised of 2 functions. One, its net operating income that's generated by the underlying properties, that's used to pay the fees from that business. And then secondly, it is the delivery, our obligation and what we have done since we started the business, our delivery of tax credits that we promised to the investors. And those cash credits are earned over the life of the partnerships.","Richard Anderson","Yes, okay, understood. All right. And Terry or some -- maybe broader question. The -- as I've said on a few of your competitor's call, the theme of this quarter has been low turnover, or as you call it, high retention. And I'm curious if you have an epiphany about why suddenly we're seeing such a sort of a dramatic decline in turnover. Is there something about this cycle that's different? Or do you think that this is something that's got shelf life to it?","Terry Considine","Rich, while I gather my thoughts. Let me ask Keith to comment on it, because he's responsible for a lot of our success.","Keith Kimmel","Rich, I wouldn't say that it's -- for us it's anything that's quite that unique. If you think about our calls over many quarter, this is our long-term strategy. We've talked about retaining our residents, having lower-turnover cost. And for us it's been a specific strategy that we think is playing out. That's around customer satisfaction. Our -- we've had our 19th consecutive quarter of better than 4 stars. We know that those folks that are happy with us stay with us longer. Customer selection is a really big part of this, when we're not evicting residents or having people that are moving on unexpectedly. We know that, that creates a better environment at our communities in which people stay longer. And then I would point to our team's execution as we have emphasized this point of maintaining our residents so we have turn cost avoidance, frictional vacancy and things like that. So this is an area we focused on for many years and don't believe that we're going to stop thinking about it that way. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Keith. Rich, I would add, Keith gives a good explanation of why Aimco does particularly well by that measure. But I think your question was more around the general experience of that and I think there are probably 2 things that come to mind. One is there is a better economy and so there's fewer credit stresses on rental households generally. And secondly, I think you can just see the -- an example of the long-term trend among the public REITs, you get better each quarter. And I think that we're delighted by what we do at Aimco but we're very admiring of what we see our sister REITs do. And I think it's a part of this discipline that these quarterly calls and your helpful questions provide, as we look at opportunities to improve and we work at it. And so I think it's improving in operations, it's the help of the economy and I think it's likely to continue.","Richard Anderson","What percentage of your tenants are single?","Terry Considine","Last time I looked it was a little bit -- about 50%. You mean single-occupied apartments.","Richard Anderson","Single, unmarried, I should say?","Terry Considine","Well, there's an ambiguity there. About half of our apartments are occupied by single -- by only one person. Sometimes they are not married but they may be sharing an apartment with someone else. So however you want -- I'm not sure what your question is there.","Richard Anderson","I don't want to get into that right here on this call.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","First question just has to do with the 50 basis points of upside to the bounded rent number for the year. I think you said earlier that was essentially led by -- driven by Bay Area, LA and Boston, I was just hoping you can maybe put a little thought behind each of those markets as what you think is driving that upside relative to initial expectation?","Keith Kimmel","Dennis, I'll walk you through it. So the Bay Area, the occupancies have just come back strong. And so as we look at those markets, it's -- it was a stronger occupancy than we thought, and so therefore we've been able to push rates. In Los Angeles, I'd give you a similar story. This last quarter, we were at 96.8% as an average daily occupancy in Los Angeles. Our nonsame-store or those buildings that are in Mid-Wilshire, we were at 97% average daily occupancy. So between those components, those were really big driving factors. In Boston, for us, it's been the suburban properties that have been the ones that have really shown strength and in all 3 of those cases, essentially we were just with strong occupancies rates we've had more strength and maybe we initially thought when we started the year.","Terry Considine","Dennis, I'd like to jump in on that because Keith pointed to some external factors and outcomes. But my view is a lot of it's due to Keith and his team, that they've worked hard and they have continuing success improving customer selection, picking people that are inclined to stay just from their own personal characteristics and then satisfying them in a measured way. And we just see everyday confirmation in our daily business that people are choosing to stay with us longer throughout the country. These are just three areas where he's done a particularly good job.","Dennis McGill","Okay. You also noted earlier on the prelease side, I think the number you said was about 50% of July leases were preleased versus 1\/3 a year ago. Is that a shift in strategy or processes on your side? Or is that just a demand-driven metric?","Keith Kimmel","Dennis, I'll start and see if Terry wants to add any. This is a very specific strategy. What we know. At the beginning of the year, we decided that we wanted to put a real emphasis around this, and the focus has been how do we match the customer who walks in, who has a desire and a want for an apartment to matching them with one that is on notice. The reason we put this emphasis here is we know that if we can match those two things together, we limit the amount of downtime between -- and vacancy loss between the time someone moves out and the time somebody moves in. And so it has been a very specific focus that we've incentivized our team around it, and put very specific expectations around how we wanted to do more of this knowing it will ultimately drive to that higher average daily occupancy that you see in the results. Terry would like to anything?","Terry Considine","Sure. This also is an example of tenant selection, customer selection. We want our customers to be people that plan ahead. And we think that they will be more stable and more likely to stay with us longer. And so by seeking out people who can plan ahead of the last minute, and make a commitment to us in a prelease, we are increasing our prospects for having them stay with us on a long-term basis, provided we do a good job of satisfying their needs.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And last question. You said that some of the benefit in the quarterly expense side was declining labor cost. And I just wanted you to clarify where in the business you're seeing that? And whether that means decelerating increases or actual declines? Because it would seem contrary just overseeing in general in the economy and specifically any construction-related labor?","Keith Kimmel","Dennis, I'll take it. So first of all, let's be clear, we're actually being our team members more. What we're finding is ways to be more efficient generally across the board. There's a lot of different ways we think about the business. We have exceptional measurement through our data analytics. We are paying our team members more for those that are -- do exceptional work and find ways to be more efficient in a way that gives us a better result.","Dennis McGill","So fewer -- I guess we should read that fewer hours, higher pay per hour?","Keith Kimmel","Could be fewer hours, yes, it could be fewer hours, it could be things that we find that we could centralize where we used to have 5 people across the country, but we could do it in a central way with these 1 or 2 people, things like that so it's a combination of those items.","Operator","And our next question, it comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","I was hoping for some more specifics on Austin's question about noncore real estate. Could you tell us what markets constitute the bottom 10% of the portfolio today?","Terry Considine","John, it's Terry. And thank you for that question. I don't think that today, that we would break it down by market. We would break it down by specific properties with specific circumstances. Sometimes the submarkets, sometimes the what side of the street they are on, sometimes their physical condition, and so it's much more micro than trying to pick a particular market.","Patti Shwayder ","John, I think you saw an example of that in your hometown just this last quarter. We sold Chestnut Hill Village. We bought the Dranoff portfolio, both in Philadelphia and it's really a focus of looking asset by asset. What do we think future performance prospects are, where is the greatest cash flow, where is the greatest growth opportunity down the road.","Paul Beldin","And just to amplify -- sorry to cut you off, John, this is Paul.","John Pawlowski","Can you give me the business case, way you continue to own senior living house?","Terry Considine","We make money. At Aimco, we are very economic, and we focus on free cash flow internal rate of return, and we focus on value creation. We have I think today 3 senior living communities. They're all in California and so we have good demand, good results. There's a little bit of a property lockup because of property 13 tax basis. But the basic reason is we make money by owning them.","John Pawlowski","Would it like a long-term buying the whole IRRs and those properties going forward versus an apartment community in the similar neighborhood?","Terry Considine","I haven't made that exact comparison but if you want me to follow-up with you, I'd be glad to.","Paul Beldin","And John, this is Paul. Just a comment on IRRs, on the senior communities, one thing that we do routinely is to stack rank all of our community based on the expected future free cash flow IRRs, and the senior properties that Terry mentioned are probably in the middle of our portfolio, they are not near the bottom 10%.","Operator","And our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo Okusanya","I just had a quick question. Most of your peers, again, did increase same-store NOI guidance this quarter and that also led to an increase in the midpoint of their FFO. You had the same phenomenon midpoint of same-store NOI is growing up on midpoint of FFO, but sure guidance is not going up. So I'm just trying to reconcile what the offset is with your numbers? And why that you don't have an increase in the midpoint of the guidance or your FFO guidance as well.","Paul Beldin","You bet, Tayo. Appreciate the question. The offset is related to the asset management business. If you look back at our transcript from the first quarter, or our earnings release, you would have noted that we talked about an expected full year contribution from asset management to be between $22 million and $24 million. Now with the sale completed, we expect that, that is going to be at the low end of the range at $22 million so that's offset.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I guess there wouldn't be a multifamily call without a Costa-Hawkins question, so I might as well ask it. So you said in your supplement that you are in markets, purposely chosen markets, that have had -- that have not had stringent rent controls here, not in markets like San Francisco and Santa Monica. My question is how confident are you that cities that you are currently in won't follow suit if proposition kind of passed?","Terry Considine","John, we've got Patti Shwayder, one of our senior colleagues here who is a member of the steering committee on these top 10 campaign. And who's a veteran of many political contests. And so I'm going to ask her to speak to it sort of on a city-by-city basis. If it were to be that Costa-Hawkins were repealed. But what I would add at the beginning, which is something that was touched on in the remarks in our earnings release is that -- I've operated in the state before there was Costa-Hawkins and business was good. The areas where the government becomes the most intrusive and where the risk of rent control is greatest at least historically are areas we've avoided. Going forward, it's of course, unpredictable but it's that experience that leads us to think that on a more balanced view that life will continue after Costa-Hawkins. But, Patti, what would you say about the campaign and where we stand?","Patti Shwayder","Sure and answer your question, how confident are we that these are cities that won't pass rent control, we can look at the last couple of years for an example. Since 2016, there have been 11 cities that have had Costa-Hawkins on the ballot. And we've been successful in defeating it in 9 of them. The 2 where Aimco was involved in, Redwood City in specific, they were defeated substantially, so it's going to be one by one by one, as it has in the past with Costa-Hawkins, without Costa-Hawkins, as Terry said, when you look at the facts and when you look at housing in California and how these ballot initiatives are put forward, we've had some success and I expect that will happen in the future.","John Kim","One of your competitors [indiscernible] discussed stepping up their short-term rental program, and I'm wondering if you could remind us what your views of having this in your portfolio is? And how that compares to your views on Airbnb?","Terry Considine","Those are two questions. And John, we'll raise the limit to answer both of them. The first is that we're not in the short-term rental business. And it's a perfectly good business. It's more -- it's going in the direction of hotel business. It has pluses and minuses, also it has attractive pricing. But also has turnover and transaction cost. Our target is on long-term residential communities with stable neighbors, stable neighborhoods and the benefit of that kind of predictability and continuity. And so we're not at all interested in short-term rentals. The second question is about Airbnb. And the reason that we are litigating with Airbnb is because it's important to Aimco that we pick your neighbor and provide you the safety and comfort of a stable neighborhood. With Airbnb, there is no consideration of who is their customer or what is their behavior. And so our obligation to the 95%, who want ability is in conflict with Airbnb's interference. And I thought that the Airbnb business model was innocently naive. But it now seems to be built on a reckless disregard of our residents and our property rights, noncompliance with law and regulation, a callous lack of concern for Airbnb's own customers whose vacations are very much at risk for being ruined by reason of unknowing participation in Airbnb's unlawful actions and trespass. Well, actually the two views come from the same concern for our long-term customers.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you all very much. I know you've had long weeks and that it's the Friday afternoon, we appreciate your spending some of that with us. At Aimco, we're very upbeat about the future. If we've left you with any questions, please feel free to call Paul or Lynn or Suzie or Connor or any of our team, and we'll try to be as transparent as we can be. Thanks very much.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2013 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, EVP in Charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. I'm pleased to report our third quarter of year-to-date results, and I'm delighted to report that Aimco is on plan and on track.","Before we turn to the details of the third quarter, I'd like to comment on certain qualitative aspects of 3 important areas of the Aimco business. These are factors that will shape Aimco not only this year but also for years to come.","First, under Keith's leadership, Aimco property operations are getting better and better. This can be seen in numerous metrics. Tier 2. Keith places great emphasis on customer service. That pays off when more customers renew. Our renewal rate is well above industry averages, and that is true across Aimco in different markets and at different price points.","Second, lower turnover leads to lower cost. Keith and his team excel at cost control. One metric we use measures property expenses, including utilities net of reimbursements, but excluding taxes and insurance. By this measure, costs have declined for the past several years and are down again this year by almost 2%.","Second, let's turn to Portfolio Management. You know that Aimco's portfolio is diversified geographically across markets and also by price point, with about 1\/3 As, 1\/3 Bs and 1\/3 Cs. Our mix and our properties get better and better. John and his team continue to upgrade Aimco's portfolio by accretive investments funded by the sale of lower-rated properties. One example is our redevelopment activity. We expect net operating income yields to average about 7% with today's untrended rents and to approach 8% with the rents expected at stabilization. Costs have increased but expected rents have also gone up. The net effect and value creation is roughly a wash. We project that completion of our current redevelopment program will add about $2 a share to Aimco net asset value.","A second example is One Canal Street. As we announced earlier this month, we've entered into an agreement with Trinity Financial, an experienced Boston developer, to develop a 12-story building in Boston's West End. We plan to invest $190 million and to achieve average revenues of $3,700 a month per apartment home at today's rents. A consequence of these activities, average monthly revenue per apartment home, already more than $1,400, is expected to increase by $100 or more each year for the next few years as redevelopments in One Canal Street are completed and funded by the sale of lower-rated properties whose rents are well below our current average rents.","Third and finally, let's turn to the balance sheet. Ernie and his team keep Aimco finances in good and improving condition. We enjoy good liquidity and have few unfunded commitments. We employ nonrecourse leverage with a long average duration that serves as a partial hedge against interest rate increases. We are committed to lowering our leverage so that the ratio of leveraged EBITDA is below 7:1 and we are on track to meet this target in the next few months. The sustained qualitative improvements in Aimco property operations, portfolio and balance sheet have been accompanied by solid, quantitative results. Year-to-date, FFO is up 11% over last year, and year-to-date AFFO is up 15% year-over-year. These accomplishments are due to the hard work and collaborative spirit of the entire Aimco team, and they have my sincere thanks.","I'd like to take a moment to talk about what we see looking forward. On average, this year's rent increases are slightly lower than those achieved last year. Even so, 2013 is a very good year for the apartment business and for Aimco. True, some markets are slowing. For example, our largest market, Washington D.C. But other markets are improving. For example, our second largest market, Los Angeles. 2014 rent growth will be a function of how much stronger markets offset weaker markets across our diversified portfolio.","One Aimco advantage will be substantial redevelopment deliveries in the expected-to-be strong California markets. While Ernie will not give specific guidance until early next year, we look forward to higher portfolio quality and to lower financial leverage in 2014. And we forecast revenue growth to be above, and operating cost increases to be below, their long-term trends. In short, we're planning on 2014 being another good year for Aimco.","Now for our further report on third quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid peak leasing season and we're on track for a good year. During the third quarter, we achieved renewal rent increases of 5.1%. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter in which renewing residents were willing to pay rents 5% or more above their expiring lease rates to continue to live in an Aimco apartment home. These results are reflective of our success in consistently providing excellent customer service to our residents.","During the quarter, our new leases were signed at rates that were on average 1.7% higher than expiring leases. Several key markets enjoyed superior results for the quarter versus the portfolio average and as compared to the third quarter of 2012. These include Los Angeles, Miami and the Bay Area. There was a general softening in the greater D.C. and Philadelphia markets, where late in the quarter, Aimco took a proactive approach and implemented a strategic plan to bolster occupancy in advance of our normal seasonal slowdown. We see this as a good trait as we wrapped up a solid peak leasing season and enter into the slower winter months as it's more highly occupied.","Turnover for the quarter was 44.7%, 2% better than the third quarter of 2012. Of the customers who decided to move out, 25% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 16% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these moveout reasons versus our long-term averages. We continue to be successful in replacing moveouts with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the third quarter was $119,000. The median income was $70,000, resulting in a rent-to-income ratio of 20%. This marks an 11% improvement in median income versus the second quarter and an 8% improvement year-over-year.","Our operations team continue to implement several programs designed to provide additional value to our customers through a variety of products and services, generating other income growth of 9.9% compared to the third quarter of last year.","Looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up 2\/3 of our revenue. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from about 7.5% to 11% for the quarter. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Chicago and Miami. Our steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth from 5% to 6% were Denver, Orange County and Los Angeles. In rounding out the 10 largest markets in the 2% to 4% range, we had Philadelphia, Boston, San Diego and Washington, D.C. With a strong notes as noted above in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Orange County, we are especially encouraged by our current and future California portfolio. As we stabilize acquired and redeveloped assets in those markets, Aimco's footprint will further expand westward. We will move from 1\/4 of NOI contributions in California to around 1\/3 of NOI contributions in the coming years. This will poise us to take advantage of the strong markets in both Northern and Southern California.","Looking ahead to our early fourth quarter results. Leasing activity completed in the month of October is better than both our September 2013 and October 2012. This is evidenced by our October being 20 basis points more highly occupied year-over-year; blended lease rates, 40 basis points higher; and new lease rates 70 basis points higher than prior year.","November and December renewal offers went out with 4% to 6% increases anticipating that will capture 4.5% to 5% renewal growth.","I'll now turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John E. Bezzant","Thanks, Keith. I'll provide today an update on our major redevelopment projects, as well as additional information on our transactional activities. During the third quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in 5 redevelopment projects and $10 million in our One Canal Street development in Boston. We also invested $5 million in projects currently in our redevelopment pipeline.","As Terry mentioned in his remarks, we've seen some recent challenges at 2 of our largest redevelopment properties: Preserve at Marin and Lincoln Place, where we've also made good progress since our last report. At Preserve at Marin, we have increased our anticipated total project cost by $15 million. This increase is a result of documentation, design and physical condition issues that became apparent as we commence the construction. While this has delayed our delivery slightly and driven costs higher, we are also benefiting from a continued strong apartment market in the Bay Area. Some market rents in Marin are up over 15% since project inception, above our underwritten projection for market growth. We now expect first occupancy of this project in January with completion still planned for the third quarter of 2014.","At Lincoln Place, as we progress further through the redevelopment of the 45 historic buildings on the site, we saw a much higher-than-anticipated physical deterioration leading to an increase of $22 million in our estimate of total project cost to completion from what we had reported last quarter. In spite of the additional work necessary to remediate these conditions, we remain on track to complete this project in the fourth quarter of 2014.","As of September 30, we had delivered 65 Phase 1 apartment homes, all of which were occupied, and 66 Phase 2 apartment homes, 40 of which were occupied or preleased. We are still in the early days of lease up for this project and our pioneering residents are graciously dealing with life in a very active construction zone. So we are pleased that to date, our rents are modestly exceeding our underwriting.","At Pacific Bay Vistas, we commenced apartment home rentals in August. Through September 30, we delivered 66 apartment homes and had 54 of those leased and in occupancy with 10 additional homes preleased for occupancy subsequent to quarter end. We are confident in our current cost estimates and delivery schedule as reflected in Schedule 10 and expect to complete this project in the second quarter of 2014.","Our third quarter disposition activities included 3 Affordable Properties and 5 Conventional Properties. We closed another 7 sales during October. The October sale properties had average revenue per home of $956 per month, generated gross proceeds of $122 million and Aimco net proceeds of $36 million at an average free cash flow cap rate of 5.9%.","Consistent with our 2013 plan, our third quarter disposition activity increased over the prior quarter. We have accordingly increased our 2013 sales forecast to reflect the acceleration of sales from early 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect to accomplish 2 goals with this accelerated sales activity.","First, we fund our 2013 acquisition investments. The strategy is consistent with our paired trade discipline and our desire to continue to recycle capital from lower-rated assets into submarkets and properties with higher rents and operating margins, better projected revenue growth rates and higher free cash flow internal rates of return.","Second, we take advantage of increased buyer motivation resulting from the recent decline in interest rates. We are actively in the market now with more of the lower-rated assets we had planned on selling throughout 2014. Proceeds from these sales will fund next year's investment activity. Given this accelerated marketing, we expect 2014 sales to be much more front-end loaded than this year's quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, John. Pro forma FFO of $0.50 per share was at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. Year-over-year, same-store net operating income growth was 5.9% for the quarter. Our average rent per apartment home was up 3.7% over last year, while other income was up 9.9%, leading to an increase in revenue per apartment home of 4.4%. Total revenue was also up 4.4% as average daily occupancy was flat at 95.3%.","For the quarter, operating expenses increased to 1.6% from prior year, with real estate taxes insurance and utilities up 4.8% in total while other costs were down 1.2%. Year-to-date, operating expenses increased 3.8%, with real estate taxes, insurance and utilities up 6.9% in total. This result is consistent with our guidance from the beginning of the year, where we expected in total that these items will be an increase between 5% and 8%. All other costs were up 1% year-to-date.","Our full year guidance for expense growth is now 2.75% at its midpoint, which is a 50 basis point decline from the midpoint of our prior expectations. We've adjusted our revenue guidance to the lower end of our previous range, lowering its midpoint by 20 basis points. The net effect of reducing both our revenue and expense growth expectations lowered our midpoint for NOI guidance by about 10 basis points or $600,000 for the full year for less than $0.005 a share.","Regarding our balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, we had outstanding borrowings on our credit facility of $298 million. Of this amount, $119 million related to the second quarter purchase of the West Harlem property loans. We expect to repay the line borrowings upon collection of the outstanding West Harlem property loan and with the proceeds from paired property sales. We still expect to reach our target of 7x coverage by the first quarter of 2014.","Finally, regarding earnings guidance on pages 6 and 7 of our earnings release, you can find updates to our 2013 outlook. We are maintaining the midpoint of our full year pro forma FFO guidance in narrow -- in its range. We have lowered our AFFO guidance at its midpoint by $0.01 per share. Our guidance for capital replacement spending related to multi-phase capital projects has increased $2 million as we continue to have the opportunity to accelerate investment from 2014 to 2013 at our Park Towne Place community in Center City, Philadelphia.","For the fourth quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be at $0.53 to $0.59 per share, with year-over-year Conventional same-store NOI growth projected to be 6.25% to 7.25%. Fourth quarter Conventional same-store NOI is projected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% compared to third quarter.","Fourth quarter FFO is expected to reflect an improvement over the third quarter as we anticipate increases in sequential operating results. Also, as we noted in our initial guidance, we anticipate some benefit from nonrecurring revenues occurring in the fourth quarter.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. You can submit your questions for time in the queue. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph at Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk more about your decision of proactively target occupancy in D.C. and Philadelphia and what you're seeing in those markets today?","Keith M. Kimmel","Nicholas, this is Keith. I'll take that. As we thought about it, we were looking at our peak leasing season coming from July to August, and we are looking into the fourth quarter and said we wanted to take advantage of the demand that exists in September. And with that strategy in mind, we decided to put a particular special in place in which we built occupancy in both Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. by 60 basis points. And as we look back on it, we feel very good about that paired trade that we made, that we were able to build occupancy and now we're in a stronger position going into the fourth quarter.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then how's the increase in expected spend for the redevelopment pipeline impacting your expected returns?","Terry Considine","Nicholas, this is Terry. And the answer is that it is kind of a wash, as I mentioned, that it turns out we're a little optimistic about cost and about scope, but we're also perhaps pessimistic about expected rent growth. And so as we achieved rents, as we lease them up, we think that will come out in about the same place in terms of value creation.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Stevenson in Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Ernie, how many of the remaining 79 Affordable assets can you legitimately sell any time in the near future, given financing or other restrictions on those assets?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Let me take a pass at that, Rob, and I'll ask John to chime in also. As you note in our Schedule II, we -- we know both in Affordable same-store portfolio and that's made up of our tax credit properties and then we have our other Affordable Properties. The other Affordable Properties, which are roughly 30, those we're going to be able to sell here in the very near future. There really are no restrictions from a financing perspective. They're certainly the process we need to go through in those sales in terms of getting approvals for the folks that are going to be buying. But those 30 or so assets we'd expect to sell, John, probably in the next few months to 1 year or so, there'll be a handful of those that maybe take a little longer but that's the group that you'll see going away very quickly here. Of the 48 tax credit deals, there we have more of an economic restriction than anything else, and we anticipate selling those, Rob, as the tax credit compliance period expires on those. Next year, it'll be a few of those that would sell if those tax credit compliance period end. Overall, we expect to take about 5 or 6 years to get through those remaining 48. John, anything you want to add to that?","John E. Bezzant","Yes, just to clarify in the handful that are there. We've made economic decisions on each of those that the right time to sell is not right now on those. For various reasons, we feel like holding those for another year or 2. It gives us the right economic answer as we transact those. There really are no issues in terms of liquidity. People able to secure financing or buyer interest in -- out in the market today.","Ernest M. Freedman","And, Rob, I'd highlight that at the end of this year we'd anticipate our Affordable portfolio will be contributing roughly 8% both at the GAV and NOI lines around there. And then next year, it will be down probably to the high 6s, the low 7s and work its way down from there over the next many years. So it certainly become a de minimis part of our business.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And given the commentary on sales, as well as the earnings growth here, Ernie, what is -- how close are you getting to taxable earnings with the dividend that would require you guys either pay up it or pay something else out, et cetera?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes generally -- excuse me Rob, with the numbers we provided in terms of our expectation and disposition, certainly, depending on which asset sells, will have different gains on sales that would impact our taxable income. But what we were projecting today is that we'll have room and I won't have any issue with dividend coverage from that perspective with over projecting to sell this year. From an operating income perspective, we have a lots of cushion. When you start factoring the gains from sales on the sales we certainly get closer to our dividend amount to taxable income. But we're not bumping up against that or over that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Bennett in Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just one question on California. You've been pushing rents there over the past couple of years. I'm just curious where kind of rent to income sits in your California markets today. I think you said it was 20% for the portfolio overall, and what your outlook is for being able to push it further into -- out '14 and beyond?","Keith M. Kimmel","Brian, this is Keith. I'll take that. In California, as you've noted, we have certainly had the opportunity to take advantage of an accelerating market. Over the past quarter, we were able to push rents even further beyond where we were before. In fact, we've seen new lease prices moving north of 6% and renewals staying right and around the 5%. As we look at the rent to income ratios, they are relatively in line with some of our national averages and haven't seen a real material change there.","Terry Considine","Brian, this is Terry. What I would call out and add to that is that, with the upgrading of the California portfolio and with the strength of that economy. In our customer segments, you can see that customer incomes are rising even faster.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. Appreciate the color. And then, I guess, I'll just stay with California, you noted that it's going to become closer to 1\/3 of your Conventional portfolio over the next couple of years. I guess, which other regions will be -- we'll see a significant, more significant decline if California is taking share here?","John E. Bezzant","Yes, Ryan, this is John. Basically, it's going to be out in the tertiary markets around the country. We've talked considerably of our capital recycling and portfolio allocation over the last few years. You can see in the sales that we executed this quarter what we've done already in October. We'll continue to move out of Central Florida, Texas, upper Midwest, some of these other markets that are not part of our targets long term.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Understood. And then just lastly, in terms of the concession programs in Philadelphia and D.C., were any other markets considered back in the summer when you're coming to the decision on those 2 in particular? Or were those going to -- you've been contemplated?","Keith M. Kimmel","Ryan, this is Keith. Those were really the 2 that we contemplated. We were -- we wanted to get in the position knowing that their -- the new supply both in Philadelphia and D.C. could be impactful as we look into the fourth quarter. We wouldn't want to be scrambling or pushing at a time of the season when there's not the type of demand that we could take advantage of the opportunity. And therefore, we saw September as being the place to do that and with a 60 basis point improvement, we feel good about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","On the redevelopment pipeline, what is your level of confidence that there won't be more cost increases on the horizon?","John E. Bezzant","Dave, this is John. These are redevelopments primarily, Preserve and at Lincoln both, these are empty buildings, and so we don't have a clear visibility into every one of those buildings. There are a lot of them at Lincoln, and so I'm not going to give you 100% certainty, but I will tell you that -- they are certainly pretty high wherein we were getting pretty comfortable that as we work through -- throughout as a team at Lincoln this week, we're able to see the progress there and it's good. And we're seeing, as we go through the buildings, yes, there are some issues and we've got those contemplated in the current forecast and the repricing today. At Preserve, same scenario. We feel like we've learned all of the worst lessons. Could there be more surprises? Yes. But we certainly don't anticipate them right now.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","All right. And, Terry, this serves as a reminder that redevelopment can be risky. You're doing some development but we all know that, that's risky. You're doing some acquisitions but the market is quite competitive. Another option could be share repurchases. Your shares are trading out at a pretty significant discount, and some of your peers are starting to commence activity. Can you update us on your thoughts on share buybacks?","Terry Considine","David, thank you very much for the question. You're exactly right and share buybacks are something that we consider in keeping our toolkit. It's something that we've done in scale in previous years. I would say at this moment, we're giving a greater priority to fixing the portfolio where we want it to be and fixing the balance sheet, where we want it to be. As I've mentioned in my remarks, in the next 3 or so years as we complete our activities, you're going to see average rents for up from about $1,400 a day to closing towards $2,000 and you're going to see the leverage -- under-leveraged EBITDA under 7:1. Those are our 2 priorities. Once we have those behind us, then we'll take a hard look at what's the next best use for capital.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Right. So on the objective to improve the quality of the portfolio, as you sell assets, you are prioritizing acquisitions maybe in line with some of the acquisitions that you've done over the past year over the buyback opportunities. Is that correct?","Terry Considine","No. What I'd say is our acquisitions are quite few if you look at it over the last couple of years. I think we made 2 -- 2 small ones and our 3 small ones in 2012. And I think we've made 2 small ones or 3 small ones this year. So I would not say that we are a aggressive acquirer. Our focus is having the right portfolio and the right balance sheet and see if that doesn't correct the discount that we see to net asset value.","Ernest M. Freedman","And, Dave, let me just add in there because we've been talking about it for a while now that our goal is to get 7x leverage and we had said a couple of years ago, we'll take this through 2015. Today, we're projecting that, that's we'll get there in the early part of 2014. So I would certainly say if you're going to ask how we're prioritizing things, certainly, balance sheet and our internal opportunities to redevelopments far outweigh anything we maybe considering on the acquisition side. And I think our activity has shown that as well.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","The last question is on other income. Ernie, I believe that you said that at the beginning of this year is that you won't see a significant gain there as you did in 2012, but it's tracking in that direction. Can you talk about ancillary income, and what are you doing to drive this type of growth?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. Let me talk a little bit about other income and then I can ask Keith to add some color to that. Year-to-date, our other income continues to track very favorably, up 11.8%. As you can see there now in the third quarter, it's a 9.9%, so they're starting to decelerate some. And without getting into the nitty-gritty of our fourth quarter forecast, we expect to decelerate even further still in the fourth quarter. And so we'll certainly, I would suspect ending the year at a level at 10% or below in terms of other income contribution growth year-over-year. Our other income is about 10.5% of our total revenue contribution. Roughly half of that 10.5% is through utility reimbursements. The other half is through all these things that you kind of spoke to or asked about, Dave, and I'll turn it over to Keith shortly to talk about our success rates that we're having there. I would caution on the utility reimbursement side, it certainly is very much beholden to what happens with utility rates, and we have seen that utilities are up slightly this year. We also had improvement in utility reimbursement as our ability to continue to pass appropriate levels to our residents and they take up their fair share on that, and we've seen that continue to increase over the last few years. But I would expect that would level off as we're thinking about 2014 and beyond. And, Keith, do you want to spend a quick moment and talk about some of the successes we've had in parking and another amenity type fees?","Keith M. Kimmel","Sure, Ernie. Dave, I'd just -- I would also just point out, as Ernie has, that the half of it is around some of these other distinctive things, we've had similar growth rates for that type of revenue that has also increased nearly 10%. With that being said, we have a lot of emphasis around things like the parking and around pets and around storage and how we can match those things appropriately with our residents in which they get the greatest benefit and, therefore, willing to pay for them. And at times, in years past, it had been more of a -- if they come in and ask about it or -- but instead, we have a more proactive approach to really matching those needs with our residents and, therefore, it's turning into some nice growth here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste at Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Terry, earlier you talked about the balance of Aimco's portfolio today being a benefit 1\/3 As, Bs, Cs. How do you think about this balance as you upgrade your portfolio via redevelopment, select acquisition, dispositions? Where'd you like to take this portfolio balance? I know you're worried about upsetting the apple cart, introducing potentially more NOI volatility into your life down the road.","Terry Considine","Haendel, that's a very good question, and it's one that Ernie and I, and John and the entire team focus on a lot and thinking about it. I think that in terms of targets that we would see that our portfolio would become -- which is now about 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3, would probably become something 40%, 40%, 20% or -- in that range. And that the 20% that remain Cs would be what we call C+, which is that in their local market, there is C, but it's a local market that has a high average rent. And so even though C+ might have $2,000 a month's rent, for example, in New York City. And so that's where I think we're going. In terms of increased volatility, I do -- I think there'll be a certain element of that in markets and price points where it's exposed to new building. We hope to balance that with geographic diversification and by selective investment in areas that are quite desirable but not as exposed. And by that, I mean, for example, our investment in La Jolla or investment in Corte Madera. Those are areas where we're not quite as exposed to new building. The reason for doing all of that is that we're looking through to the income of our customer, and as we had in earlier question, on incomes, I think it's from Ryan Bennett that whether that -- we're going to be income constrained. On a number of our properties, we are seeing rising incomes that reflect the quality of the locations, and we think that income growth is -- permits higher rents and probably more stable incomes during any recession in the future. So it's a trade-off. But I think there is a certain possibility of increased volatility.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, sure. One more. Over the past decade, Aimco has not done much of any ground-up development. Can you talk about the rationale? Any of the return expectations for your Boston deal and specially in relation to the redevelopment opportunities within your portfolio?","Terry Considine","Haendel, I'd like to go first just to talk about history and then I'm going to turn One Canal Street over to John because he's the one who quarterbacked it through. But you'll recall that we have done this over time. In fact, the Palazzos in Los Angeles are probably the most prominent example. But even this year, we built -- we're building 100 or so ground-up units at Lincoln Place, and we're building 28 townhomes at Elm Creek. And so we do a certain amount of it, usually as, in connection with one of our redevelopments or as a Phase 2, but sometimes freestanding as in the case of Palazzo. When we looked at Boston, we weighed our long-term desire to upgrade our portfolio there to move from a more suburban portfolio to more urban portfolio. And we worked over time to identify the right site and right partner, and we like the risk-adjusted return. Now, John, you did it so...","John E. Bezzant","Yes, just specific to Boston and to One Canal, this is the deal that we've been working on for a couple of years. It's a complicated site. We've got a development partner there that is experienced in the micromarket of the area, as well as on a larger scale throughout Boston. We've got a high level of comfort with them. And we look at it as a, really, an opportunity to participate in it. It's structured more along the lines of a presale. It's not a joint venture. This is a deal where these guys are working as our, essentially, our fee developer. And we look at yields as we look out and try to remember all your questions, but as we look out yields out into the future on that, roughly 5.5% untrended, on current rent, and this is an NOI yield, and about 6.5% on the trended yield. And I would look at that today. If we had that building in that location built and occupied today, I would expect it to be a 4-cap asset, probably at the highest -- it's going to better than that. And so we're pleased with that. We look at the risk as it related to it in development, and we've structured the transaction in such a way that we have multiple layers of protection, if you will, from risk. Obviously, at first level, we've got some contingencies built into the deal. We've got a guaranteed maximum price contract with a reputable contractor. We have a development partner who has their fee at risk, and we have bonding from a third-party agency on the construction. And so we feel like we've gone through and mitigated this. This is not step one in a large expansion of Aimco's ground-up development pipeline. This is a major calculated decision in a market where we want to upgrade our portfolio. If you were to look at our portfolio today in Boston, it is primarily peripheral, far out suburban. We rank it as primarily a C portfolio given the rental values in relation to the market. And we feel that we needed an opportunity, and we saw one here to upgrade the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ernie or John, can you talk a little bit about pricing changes you've seen in the last 90 days as it relates to A, B and C quality assets and if that had any impact on the decision to accelerate dispositions in the first half of the year there?","John E. Bezzant","Sure. I'll take that. In the last 90 days, I would tell you, take it back maybe just a little bit further. So as we came into the summer, there was a reasonable exuberance in the market in terms of pricing and where we were at as interest rates rose a little in August. We did see certain types of buyers in the tertiary markets. Those yield buyers, particularly those that were sponsors that were out trying the source equity from a third-party that candidly had a little bit of a hiccup and backed up out of the market a little bit. There were still very strong participants, what I would call midmarket players, that had equity available and had discretion to them that stayed right on with it and right through it. And those buyers who are predominantly our buyers stayed right with us through the, if you will, the little bump in August with REIT. As they come back down now again, we see people that really, frankly, have -- it strengthened their commitment, if you will, to closing the deals that they have under contract. And we've not seen a major impact at all in pricing. I think we've obviously disclosed our third quarter numbers, disclosed just now, our October numbers and I would anticipate that through the remainder of this year, we will trade in the same range. Free cash flow cap rates that are going to be below a 6 on what we have visibility into right now that's out there and priced.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The decision to accelerate dispositions out of the first half of the year versus kind of match spending redevelopment along lines?","John E. Bezzant","Yes, I think I need 2 aspects to that. One is that candidly this year, with the acquisition of the senior loans, we got a little ahead of ourselves and got under the line a little deeper than we wanted to be. And so we want to make sure that we've got that covered. By the second piece of it, we look at the what we call the interest rate reprieve a little bit, and yes, that is an opportunity for us to make certain that we forward fund our commitments goinG into next year as we look at our pipeline. We've got, obviously, One Canal. We just spoke a little bit that we'll have some equity requirements next year. We'd like to make sure we'd take off the table our sources and while we've committed to our uses, and so that's the background of our decision.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just as my follow-up. I think in the prepared comments, there was a mention about expenses being down next year. Is that just a function of portfolio shift or there's this specific line item? What's going to be the driver of that?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes. Mike, this is Ernie. That came up in Terry's comments, I'll just want to clarify what was said. What Terry talked about is we expect the expenses will be below trend, not necessarily be down. So trend being inflation, we think we can do better than inflation, so I'm not willing to say at this point that we will be down overall. I'm very comfortable saying that we've been able to achieve other in areas, helping to offset expectations that real estate tax will probably a little bit above trend but not nearly as bad as they were in '13, as we look at '14. That was really the comment. And I think, Mike, it's more of the same. We continue to see opportunities and efficiencies on how we're running our apartment communities, how we're staffing them, how we're doing more and more work in a centralized basis, which has more expertise and more efficiencies. And then just with our capital spending we've done over the last many years, we're bringing a lot of our other costs down because we have more durable goods that require less repairs and maintenance. So we'll provide various specifics, Mike, as you know, in our next call, we'll provide guidance. But I just want to clarify that I don't want to take away from the call being -- that we're signing up for down -- for certain -- for next year but certainly, better than trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson at BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you mentioned earlier, no interest at this point in doing a buyback program. But how much of that is a function of Aimco having gone down the investment-grade path now and making a shot -- taking a shot at that and, hence, any kind of buyback program going in the opposite direction of that process? How much is that playing a role in that spot?","Ernest M. Freedman","That's certainly a part of it because we are certainly prioritizing our balance sheet, as well as our current internal opportunities we have for investment before something like that. And so I wouldn't tie it directly to as going down the investment-grade path. We certainly are eager and hopeful of getting that. But we're making these improvements on our balance sheet regardless if we get the good housekeeping seal of approval and we certainly hope we do, and we think we'll be deserving that over the few years. But you're absolutely right. Share buyback would take us in the wrong direction there, and it will slow us down in what we're trying to accomplish on our balance sheet.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So, I mean, is there a point where you say, Okay, we're going to give up the investment grade process if we're 25% discount to NAV or something like that? I mean, do you -- at some point do you -- could you possibly make that decision? Or are you committed, no matter what, to going investment-grade route?","Terry Considine","Rich, we're committed to a low leverage strategy. We think that we'll bring an investment-grade but that's not the goal. That's just a recognition of what we hope to accomplish. We want to have -- reduce the amount of leverage in the business. We like our leverage. We like its quality, its long duration, its safety. But we want it at a lower level. And we've committed to having it under 7:1. As Ernie said, we're couple of years ahead of reaching that goal. And when we get there, we'll take a look at where we want to take it then.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then my second question is, when did it stop being silly to consider a contrarian strategy of investing in Washington D.C., one way or another? I'm not saying that, that's now, but is that something you have your eye on at some point in the next couple of years?","Terry Considine","Rich, that is a very good question because the right time to buy in markets is when they're disrupted. So we do look at deals in Washington as we said earlier in the call. We're not a very aggressive acquirer of the market today, but we are always looking for anomalies. And in Washington D.C., it would not be a surprise to have some anomalies emerge. John, would you want to add color to that?","John E. Bezzant","I think that's an accurate look.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker at MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but just real quickly while I've got you. Looking at expenses in the quarter, I apologize if I missed this, but look like insurance was down but it's still up double digits for the year. Was there something going on in the quarter where you had some seasonality or some of those expenses pushed from one quarter to another? And then you talked about being below trend. Can you talk about what your outlook for marketing expenses specifically? Obviously, marketing expense has been very low this year. How long do you think it's sustainable to be in this sub-1% type level?","Ernest M. Freedman","Okay. Thanks, Ryan. This is Ernie. Let me cover both the insurance and the marketing. With regards to the insurance, it's certainly a little bit lumpy. We had a pretty big increase year-over-year that started impacting us late in the first quarter. Our property insurance renews on March 1. It's on the first part of the year, we certainly had some lumpiness from that increase going through. Secondarily, with insurance, our health insurance costs run through that line item as well, and we did have a poor performance earlier in the year. We actually had a very good performance in the third quarter relative to what we saw in the first 2 quarters this year with regards to what our self-insured health care costs were. So that's why you saw it coming down in the third quarter but still it's tracking higher -- as one of our higher expense increases for the year. And I think it will continue to track that way throughout the rest of the year but hopefully come down a little bit from the year-to-date number that you've seen so far. As specifically with marketing expenses, we've actually seen a slight uptick in marketing expenses over the last year or 2, not a big uptick. No, we certainly had big decreases in marketing expenses the prior years before that. As everyone moved from print type media to Web type media. I would expect that marketing expenses will stay flattish as we go forward, and we certainly challenge our buys [ph] and how we do things and run everything on a cost-per-gas-card basis. But we feel pretty comfortable. We've actually added a little dollars back into that the last couple of years but we feel comfortable with the run rate and I imagine of our many costs that we talked about as we think about next year and for the next many years, that will be more of a flattish-type spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico at UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just going back to Lincoln Place. I know you talked about the cost going up. And did you mention whether you're able to recapture some of the yield there from the costs going up?","Terry Considine","Nick, this is Terry. It's early days. We've rendered 130 or so apartments out of 800, and so we're delighted by the rent we're getting and the customer acceptance. But it's quite a beehive of activity today. It's really an active construction site. So we believe that rental achievement will improve as the property becomes more residential in character. And I think it's going to be quite a home run. I think it's going to be an important asset for Aimco for many, many years to come. And so we do expect above-average -- above underwritten rents at Lincoln, but we'll wait until we're further into it to get much more specifics.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I'm just wondering how we're supposed to think about that because I thought that the rehab, there was a restriction on keeping rents below market there?","Terry Considine","Not meaningfully. The expert on that is Miles Cortez, who's here. And If I get this wrong, Miles, please correct me. But there's a certain number of residents, I think, approximately 50 out of the total, who have the benefit of rent limits. For the balance, which is 90% of the property or 95%, they are loosely -- we're not loosely, they're regulated by Los Angeles County rent control, which is a very benign rent levels with many years before it particularly applies to our case. So we're not meaningfully constrained. Miles, would you want to add or correct that?","Miles Cortez","Yes, we have a period of another 4 years in which we can stabilize the property with virtually unlimited opportunities for rental increases. Once that 4 years is up, it becomes subject to the ordinance that Terry referred to, and it's benign in that rent increases are still permitted on an annual basis, ranging from 3% to 8% per annum, and that's after we have an opportunity to run these -- all of these homes up to market 4 years from now.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one on this. A year ago, when you've got the financing, you put out on the release showing what your net investment would be. I assume selling the tax credits for $16 million and then net income of $15 million achieved prior to stabilization. Are those still -- are those assumptions still in place for the project?","Terry Considine","Nick?","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","About a year ago, your net investment -- you're saying was roughly $300 million.","Terry Considine","But we've announced that we had some expected higher costs. But other than that, our investment would be exactly as described.","Ernest M. Freedman","Right now, we're tracking to do slightly better than those rent numbers based on the limited rents we've signed. And that's why we want to be a little cautious not to get too far in front of ourselves and that could -- saying that we're going to beat rents on underwriting. But in a very difficult construction zone, we're winning that battle right now and doing better than underwriting. So we are projecting -- we have the opportunity to do better on the NOI side from those numbers you just quoted.","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead.","Lisa R. Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2013 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in charge of Property Operations; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO. We are available to answer questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco.","Business is good. During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. Second quarter FFO per share was up 7% year-over-year and AFFO was up 9%. Year-to-date FFO per share is up 13% over last year and AFFO is up 17%. This healthy earnings growth is the direct result of the hard work of the entire Aimco team, systematically executing the plan that Ernie and I have laid out to you over the past few years.","Our plan focuses on 5 areas: property operations, portfolio management, redevelopment, balance sheet and simplicity. Let me walk you through a few particulars in each area.","In property operations, Keith will provide a detailed report in a moment, but I'd like to call your attention to 3 important items. The operating team, led by Keith, increased average daily occupancy year-over-year and more impressively, compared to this year's first quarter. The sequential increase in occupancy is noteworthy because we usually see a sequential decrease in second quarter occupancy due to the higher turnover of the leasing season.","Keith and his team also outperformed industry benchmarks for average customer stay, with resident renewal rates continuing to be higher and turnover continuing to be lower than industry averages. Finally, on expiring leases, Keith and his team increased blended rental rates by more than 4%. Together with the earn-in of higher rents achieved in previous quarters, the rate of increase in our year-to-date same-store revenue accelerated and is up 50 basis points from last year.","Next in portfolio management, our broadly diversified portfolio gets better and better. Second quarter revenue per unit was just under $1,400, an increase of more than 7% year-over-year. This is due to same-store rent growth, as well as the impact of investments in higher rent properties, funded by the sale of lower-rated properties. And of course, when we make these investments, we follow a paired trade discipline, explicitly comparing what we expect to buy to what we plan to sell. We make investments only when the projected free cash flow internal rate of return is greater than that of the property sold and portfolio quality is enhanced.","In redevelopment, we're on pace to invest $130 million to $160 million in 8 projects this year, and we continue to expect net asset value creation about equal to $2 per share.","On the balance sheet, in a few minutes, Ernie will provide a detailed update on our activities during the quarter. But the big picture is this: We remain on track to reduce total leverage to our target of 7:1 by early next year. And we continue to value the safety of our nonrecourse property debt and we appreciate the insulation from higher interest rates, provided by the relatively long weighted average maturity of our liabilities.","Our business strategy is simple: Own and operate apartments in a cross-section of large U.S. markets and upgrade our portfolio by redevelopment, selective acquisitions and sale of lower-rated properties. Through simplification, we expect higher quality of earnings, lower overhead costs and greater transparency.","We are making steady progress in all fronts. For these good results, I'd like to offer sincere thanks to all my Aimco teammates, both in the room here in Denver, as well as across the country.","I'd also like to add this reflection: After doing this for a number of years, I am more and more impressed by the importance of having the right people and even more, the right team. At Aimco, we've come to place great emphasis on culture and collaboration. We prefer to promote from within, in part because we can be more confident about these softer, more subjective qualities. As you may have read in last night's second release, the one following the earnings release, the Aimco Board of Directors earlier this week promoted John Bezzant to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, adding redevelopment to his other responsibilities.","Patti Fielding, Executive Vice President, Capital Markets and Treasury, succeeds John as Chairman of the Aimco Investment Committee, adding to her other responsibilities. Both John and Patti are terrific leaders and reliable teammates. Both are well known to many of you on this call. I hope that you'll join me in congratulating them on their promotions and in wishing for their continued success.","Now for a more detailed report on the second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report, we remain on pace to meet our objectives for 2013. We continue to execute our plan with focus and enthusiasm. As a result, we saw second quarter revenue growth accelerate by 50 basis points over the second quarter of last year. And as Terry mentioned, with the acceleration we saw in the first quarter, our year-to-date revenue growth is also 50 basis points ahead of last year.","Because of our continued commitment to our goal of consistently providing excellent customer service to our residents, we achieved renewal rent increases of 5.2% in the second quarter. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which renewing residents were willing to pay rent 5% or more above their expiring lease rates to continue to live in an Aimco apartment home.","During the quarter, new leases were signed at rates that were on average, 3.1% higher than expiring leases, an improvement of 50 basis points over the first quarter of this year. As a result of our team's hard work across the country, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.1% for the quarter. Of the customers who decided to move out, 29% were for career moves, 17% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes.","We continue to be successful in replacing move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the second quarter was $106,000. The median income was $65,000, resulting in a rent-to-income ratio of 21%. Our operations team also continue to implement several programs designed to provide additional value to our customers, through offerings of distinctive products and services, generating other income growth of 12.7% compared to the second quarter of last year.","Looking at our 10 largest markets, which make up 2\/3 of our revenue. The top 3 performers had revenue increases from about 7.5% to 10% for the quarter. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami and Denver. Our steady performers for the quarter with midrange growth from 4% to about 5.5% were Orange County, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And rounding out our 10 largest markets in the 3% to 4% range, we had Boston, Washington, D.C. and San Diego.","Looking ahead, we're building upon our second quarter successes and we are on plan for a solid second half of the year. July blended lease rates were up 4.3%, with new lease rates up 3.6% and renewals up 5.1%. July's average daily occupancy was 95.2%, on plan as we progress through peak leasing season. Our August and September renewal offers went out with 6% to 8% increases.","And before I turn the call over to Ernie, I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of all my teammates across Aimco. Each and every one has worked hard over the last several years to achieve the alignment of objectives and high level of communication we have today. I thank you for your persistence, your collaboration and your commitment to Aimco.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, Keith. Pro forma FFO of $0.49 per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.02, primarily due to stronger-than-expected results in our non-same-store Conventional portfolio and lower interest expense.","Turning to operations. Second quarter same-store net operating income growth exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 30 basis points. Our average rent per apartment home was up 4.1% over last year, while other income was up 12.7%, leading to an increase in revenue per apartment home of 5%.","Total revenue was up 5.1%, as we had a year-over-year increase in average daily occupancy of 10 bps.","For expenses, I'll next provide some details on results for the second quarter, results year-to-date and finally, our expectations for the full year. Implied in our updated guidance for the year is a reduction in the growth rate of expenses in the second half of 2013 compared to the first half, which was and remains our expectation.","For the quarter, operating expenses increased 4.8% from prior year. About 2\/3 of this increase was related to real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, which were up 6% in total. On a year-to-date basis, operating expenses have increased 5%. About 80% of this increase is attributable to real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, which were up 7.8% in total. This result is consistent with our guidance from the beginning of the year where we expected in total that these items would increase between 5% and 8%.","Outside of these items, the largest year-over-year variance in operating expenses is in the area of software, technology and other administrative expenses, which is up $1.2 million. About half of this cost increase is offset by lower personnel costs, as technology improvements completed have helped to reduce labor hours at our communities. These costs have also increased year-to-date as a result of a pilot program that is designed to move additional administrative work off-site, which could lead to further reductions in labor hours in the future. The remainder of our operating expenses are up 50 basis points year-over-year.","Our full year guidance for expense growth is now 3% to 3.5%, which maintains our previous midpoint of guidance of 3.25%. We expect our expense growth rate to moderate to 1% to 2% for the second half of 2013, which is consistent with our expectations from the start of the year. This moderation is based on a couple of factors. First, real estate taxes were elevated in the fourth quarter of 2012, as end of the year assessment and millage rate increases came in higher than we had anticipated. This should make for an easier comp for us this year. In addition, some expenses in 2013 were incurred earlier in the year than last year, so timing also plays a part in our ability to have a lower expense growth rate in the second half of the year.","On the portfolio management front, asset sales during the quarter were on plan, with the sale of 2 Affordable Properties. As a reminder, our plan was for most of our sales to occur in the second half of the year, and we are on track.","Regarding our balance sheet, we increased borrowings on our line of credit by $138 million from the first quarter. Most of this increase was due to our purchase of first mortgage notes at par in the amount of $119 million associated with the group of properties in the West Harlem neighborhood of New York City. In 2006, we entered into an agreement with the local owner and operator that provided an option to acquire 84 residential buildings with 1,600 apartment homes. As part of that agreement, we've provided second mortgage financing of about $100 million.","In June, we amended our current arrangements with the borrower. In conjunction with the acquisition of the first mortgage loans, the borrower agreed to repay all loans later this year. In addition, the borrower also agreed to buy back our unexercised option to purchase the properties. In total, the first and second mortgage notes and unexercised option are valued at about $229 million on our balance sheet.","Due to this transaction, our debt and preferred equity to EBITDA coverage has increased from prior quarter to 8x, as noted in our supplemental schedule 4. We still expect to reach our target of 7x coverage by the first quarter of 2014.","During the second quarter, Fitch initiated coverage of Aimco at BB+ with a positive outlook. We were pleased by Fitch's positive review of our business and balance sheet. We are also pleased that Fitch provided a road map of what it would take for Aimco to be rated by Fitch as investment grade. We meet or are near each of their requirements with the exception of the size of our unencumbered pool. Today, our unencumbered pool includes 4 properties with a growth asset value of $190 million. Fitch suggested an unencumbered pool of $500 million would be consistent with an investment-grade rating, using a stressed cap rate of 8%. This equates to a pool of a bit less than $700 million at today's market cap rates or roughly 7% of our gross asset value. Though our normal course of refinancing activity as property debt matures, on a leverage neutral basis, we have the opportunity to grow that pool by about $150 million to $200 million a year.","Finally, regarding guidance. On Page 6 of our earnings release, you can find updates to our 2013 outlook. We are increasing full year pro forma FFO by $1 -- or excuse me, $0.01 at the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range. We are decreasing full year AFFO by $0.02 at the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range. This decrease considered the $0.01 increase in FFO, offset by an increase in capital replacement spending of $0.03, as we are ahead of schedule on one of our multi-phased projects, allowing us to move previously planned 2014 spend into 2013.","For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.48 to $0.52 per share, with year-over-year Conventional same-store NOI growth projected to be 5.5% to 6.5%. Third quarter Conventional same-store NOI is projected to be up 1.25% to 2.25% compared to the second quarter.","Fourth quarter FFO is expected to reflect a significant improvement over the third quarter, as we anticipate further and larger gains in sequential operating results. Also, as we noted in our initial guidance, we will have some benefit from nonrecurring revenues occurring in the fourth quarter.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, I'll turn it over to you for our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph at Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ernie, a quick question on guidance. So you beat the midpoint of 2Q guidance by $0.02, but you only raised the midpoint of full year guidance by $0.01. So effectively, you lowered the back half of guidance by $0.01. So could you talk about what's changed in terms of your expectations for the back half versus initial guidance?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure, I'd be happy to address that. Really not much has changed. As you can see from an NOI perspective, we've kept everything similar. What I would say is that I'm probably just being a little conservative, not raising it $0.02 versus $0.01. We see the year playing out very similar to the second half of the year, and $0.01 on second half guidance of about $1.06 [ph] or so is obviously a small percentage. So we see the year playing out very similar to how we saw the first part of the year and just being a little cautious by not raising the midpoint by $0.02.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And do you have an update on the Pacific Bay Vistas redevelopment project, redesign?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. We're happy to report on Pacific Bay Vistas that we had our first move-ins actually yesterday, on August 1. I'll turn it over to Keith to just talk a little bit about what we're seeing there with regards to renting activity. It's early days, but we can give you a little bit of color on that.","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Ernie. Nick, yesterday, in fact, we had our first 9 residents move in to Pacific Bay Vistas. We're just thrilled to have them in. It really went very smoothly. In addition to that, we have another 16 pre-leased in our first phases that will move in over the next couple of weeks. And in totality of all of those, we actually are seeing our rentals coming in above our trended underwritten rent, so we're very pleased and looking forward to the project moving forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Stevenson at Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Terry, you probably have been probably the strongest proponent in the REIT space of -- over the years of property-specific self-amortizing debt. I mean, what has sort of led you guys to seek or to slowly move down the path towards investment grade, if you guys continue to move down there? Is it just access to different options? Is there something that's driving that, et cetera?","Terry Considine","Rob, no, I'd say there hasn't been a special change. What's happened is that as we've pursued our own balance sheet strategies, there's been a better understanding in the market and by rating agencies of how safe and sound they are. And so I'm glad to see that recognized. We'll have some benefits to us in pricing on our line of credit, which, as you know, we use sparingly, and in the issuance of any preferred stock. But the primary fact of it is the greater market recognition of the soundness of our balance sheet.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then can you guys talk a little bit about what you're seeing operationally in the D.C. market, the sort of Northern Virginia versus the Maryland suburbs, especially?","Keith M. Kimmel","Sure. Rob, this is Keith. I'll take that. In D.C., we're just very pleased to see that we continue to maintain high occupancies. Throughout the second quarter, we were in the high 95s, mid-95s in occupancy. We've definitely seen a little more strength in Northern Virginia versus Maryland. But it's -- we're well positioned. We really believe that sort of -- our BB+ assets that are in and around the Beltway have insulated us a little better than others, and we're looking forward to the second half of the year.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Now, when you -- as you go into the sort of weaker leasing season of the fall here, do you push more occupancy at the expense of rental rate in order to drive higher occupancy in that market and guard against move-outs? Or is there any difference and change operationally between how you're addressing that market versus markets that are further up on the strength list?","Keith M. Kimmel","Well, Rob, what I would just tell you is that across the country, we're very focused on high retention, low turnover, and that's not much different in D.C. In fact, we have a very strong focus on that. We're pleased -- I'll let you know that our renewal increases in the second quarter in D.C. were nearly 5%, which represents about 55% of our business. We'll continue to be very focused on that so that we're not having to rely as much on new leases and competing with new product the way that maybe some others would. And once again, we just -- our position with our product around the Beltway, we think we're just better positioned. And we'll look forward to the second half of the year playing out strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from Buck Horne at Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First question, I just -- going back to the expense growth, Ernie, I was wondering, are there any property tax issues that you've seen thus far that we might -- should account for going into 2014. I understand you got some good comparisons in the second half of this year, but any expense items we should think about for the fiscal year 2014?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes, Buck. I can address what's happened with the real estate. We were caught a little bit by surprise in the first half of this year, which I hope will give us an easier comp for 2014, specifically in the Chicago area. DuPage County came out with very, very high millage rate increases. And millage rate increases are always a bit of a risk. At this point at this point in the season in talking to assessors, where we haven't received assessments or assessments in hand, we have a pretty high confidence that we have a pretty good sense of where our assessments are going to be for '13. I'd say at about the 90% range in terms of expectation there. But we don't have a good sense yet for if there are going to be millage rate changes, Buck, in the second half of the year. At this point, we've got about 40% to 45% of those in. So that's always a risk item. And of course, those come in later this year. There will be some impact on our run rate, how is it compared to '14. In general though, we're seeing that assessments are starting to level off. The catch-up has happened. And so where we had a big catch-up in the second half of 2012 and early part of 2013 in terms of assessment increase, and not just us, everyone, of course, has seen that, it led me to believe that as values are more stabilizing across the board and not increasing significantly, that we'd probably see a steadier stream of assessment increases, meaning more like an inflationary increase going into next year. But of course, we'll have to wait and see as to how that plays out.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, I'm also thinking just -- thinking about the West Coast a little bit and your California properties. Do you guys have a sense of the estimated value of your California properties relative to the assessed taxable value for Prop 13 purposes and what the implied value differential might be on NAV -- from an NAV perspective? Is there any sense of what that differential is internally?","Ernest M. Freedman","It is, Buck. We track that very carefully, and then just -- and happy to talk about that. For our same-store portfolio, we have roughly about a $10 million exposure, if our properties were marked up to market. Today, in our redev portfolio, it's about a $1 million exposure. So in total, about $11 million. One thing I can say about our California properties, and I've seen it come up in other transcripts, and there's not just Prop 13 in California, but there's also Prop 8. And you're seeing some of the folks of California exposure have their Prop 8 increases decrease significantly because they had the decreases in the last couple of years. We only have 4 properties at this point that have Prop 8 exposures, and so we don't have a big exposure there. But if there was a mark to market, it'd be $10 million for our same-store portfolio and roughly $1 million for our redev portfolio.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Yulico at UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ernie, I just want to make sure I understood this. Is the purchase of that West Harlem property loans, is that adding to your FFO guidance this year?","Ernest M. Freedman","No, that's actually pretty neutral because we've had to borrow money to go up against that, and so it's actually relatively neutral. And those notes are generating income at about 5.2%. We borrowed on our line of credit, and that's roughly at about a 3% cost. So that doesn't have a very big or material impact on the second half of the year for us in terms of what's happening with FFO. It's just replacing some other investment activity that might -- that could have been there.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then just bigger picture question on cap rates. How you guys are thinking about, if cap rates have gone up yet and particularly for, let's say, parts of the market where the buyers tend to be using 70% type GSE debt, second tier type locations, have you seen cap rates move? Do you expect them to?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure, Nick. Let me turn over to John Bezzant to answer that question.","John E. Bezzant","Nick, we haven't seen any major move in cap rates at this point in time. We've got several -- many properties under contract right now, as we move into this second year of sales plan -- second half of the year sales plan. And we've had some people -- some of the bolder buyers will come back and make an argument that they've had some pain inflicted on them by the rising rates. And candidly right now, our answer has been, \"Tough luck. You signed the contract at the prior price, and we're going to proceed.\" We haven't seen fall-out of transactions. We haven't seen major retrading of pricing. And frankly, here just in the last few weeks, as we've repriced some new deals that we're taking bids on right now, we're seeing pricing very consistent with what it was 3 or 4 months ago.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. I mean, are the buyers then thinking about -- if they had to pay the same pricing cap rate, I mean, are they now moving into shorter-term debt or more variable debt to help make their spread investment work?","John E. Bezzant","I don't know that I can speak accurately to what these guys that are -- or full yield buyers are doing in terms of debt structure at this point in time. Certainly, some of them are looking at shorter maturities, and that's been there play for a few years. But right now, again, I think they're all trying to just kind of reset their -- a lot of them have money to place still. There's still plenty of liquidity in the market and plenty of pressure on the buy side to get deals placed. And so right now, at a pricing level, we're really not seeing a big change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- the recent acquisition activity has really focused on kind of smaller apartment communities. I was curious if that's your new focus and kind of the reasons behind it, do you find less of the REITs bidding for those? Or are there better redevelopment opportunities at these smaller communities?","John E. Bezzant","Jana, I'll take that. This is John again. An astute observation that both of those that we are looking at are -- that we bought in the second quarter or second and into the third quarter smaller deals, we refer to them here internally sometimes as the little jewels but these are really satellite properties that we have an opportunity that we think from an operating standpoint to operate from an existing property that's very close by. And then the other piece of it that we look at is the quality of the dirt. And feel very comfortable with the quality of the dirt in that Midtown Atlanta asset being right there near Piedmont Park. And the La Jolla asset, we'd love to get you to Southern California sometime and let you take a look at it, but it is a phenomenal asset right out of downtown La Jolla and 1.5 blocks off of the beach. And we really are looking for opportunities to buy good dirt. To your point about the competitive space, yes, that certainly is part of it. We have seen that we have been able to, in our paired trade discipline where we're really trying to get that 100 to 150 basis point gap [ph] in our unlevered free cash flow IRR between our sale properties and our buy properties, we've been able to achieve that on these smaller assets, where there's not quite the same institutional competition.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then maybe just quickly on the West Harlem property loans. I guess, maybe the intent originally was to buy these apartment communities given that option on them, just curious what has changed now.","John E. Bezzant","Yes, I'll take that one again. Back in '06, we were looking and entered an option agreement to buy those properties that we were content to own at that point in time and we're content to own them today. That was almost 7 years ago now. And as life has gone on both for the borrower, as well as for us, life has changed a little bit. We looked at it going into last fall and assessed where we wanted to place some money in terms of our asset allocation. Had some conversations with the borrower, and he indicated that really for him his life situation had changed as well. And that he, where at one point in time in '06 when he entered this agreement, was looking to, if you will, exit the business and move on to other things. He subsequently had a son and had things come on his life that he said he'd kind of like to stay in it. And so we started negotiations and discussions about a way to unwind the transaction. As we got into the middle of that, he had some debt maturities. And ultimately, once we talked through those, it was an easier execution in a period of -- a cleaner execution rather than to have him go and have to do 2 refinancings as we work through it. We decided to buy those first loans. He paid us a fee for part of that accommodation, and we entered an agreement to have him recapitalize and pay those off before the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Pehl at Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question is on the disposition guidance in the second half of 2013. I'm just curious what is the Affordable and Conventional mix of these sales and the cap rate?","John E. Bezzant","Okay. John again. The mix is roughly on a percentage basis in terms of where we think we're headed for the rest of the year would be roughly 1\/3 of it would be Affordable proceeds and about 2\/3 of it would be Conventional proceeds. Cap rate-wise, I think you would see it consistent. If you were to look back, obviously, we haven't had a lot of activity this year. And if you looked at the schedule for this quarter, the cap rates on the Affordable stuff were actually fairly high. That was due to rather unique situations of where those were located and mark-to-market situations on the properties that sold. But I think if you were to look back to last year's cap rates, you would see consistency. On the Conventional side, very similar to what we did over the full year last year. And Affordable side, it would be the same way.","Jeffrey Pehl - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And after the dispositions are completed, how much of the Affordable portfolio are still in your portfolio?","John E. Bezzant","So what we term the Affordable portfolio will be by the end of this year, largely our low-income housing tax credit properties that we did redevelopments on over the last several years. There will be a handful of properties that are not light taxed [ph], but it'll be roughly 60 properties that we will still own toward the end of this year. And then as we look forward over the coming years, as tax credits burn off and compliance periods burn off, we will dispose of those at the appropriate time in that life cycle of those tax credit deals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Keith, did you give July leasing trends where you stood at from an occupancy standpoint and also where new lease and renewal rents were in the quarter -- I mean, I'm sorry, not the quarter but the month, rather?","Keith M. Kimmel","Mike, can you just repeat just -- for July, is that what you're looking for?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","For July yes, so just in terms of as we look out what was occupancy -- the average occupancy in July also new lease and renewal rents.","Keith M. Kimmel","Sure. Average occupancy in July was 95.2% and new lease was 3.6%, renewal was 5.1%, with a blend of 4.3%.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, very helpful there. And then where your renewal notices for August and September went on that?","Keith M. Kimmel","Sure those were -- August and September went out at 6% to 8%. And we typically see about 100 to 150 basis point meld from the ask to the ultimately take rate.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Then, John, just touch back on the acquisition strategy. I mean, first quarter of '14, you're going to be down at 7x leverage. So you're hitting your leverage target. And we haven't -- most of the time, this business strategy has been focused on funding redevelopment and focused on also helping out with leverage. As we look out to '14, '15, should we expect recycling activity to pick up more so as kind of a repositioning, as you look to improve your positioning in markets like Boston and a couple of the other ones you kind of targeted?","John E. Bezzant","Yes, I think. We certainly -- we'll look to opportunities to continue the repositioning and the reallocation within the portfolio. Boston, since you mentioned it is a primary market that we've identified in the past as one where we have kind of the dollars at work in that market that we want, but they're not quite where in the market we would like them to be. And so we would look for opportunities there to continue to recycle capital, if you will, out of the suburbs and into more core urban locations there. Further into the question in terms of where we go with the investment dollars and hitting the 7 0 on the debt. We would look -- there will be opportunities to continue our run rate on redevelopment, which will continue to get a lot of attention. We'll probably step up a little bit some of our capital enhancement projects internally, and we will continue to look for acquisitions. But candidly right now, those are relatively low on the totem pole in terms of the total return. The pricing is just not particularly compelling right now. And so we look for other ways and other places to put that money to work as we look for the capital recycling going into the future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Karin Ford at KeyBanc Capital.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","There's been a frequent theme, I guess, we've heard this earnings season, as people sort of speculated what the change in rates is going to do to cap rates, where some people seem to think that A cap rates may be a little bit more insulated than B cap rates. You guys own and see both. What's your opinion as to whether or not there'll be a bifurcation in pricing between A versus B assets?","Terry Considine","Karin, this is Terry, and I'd like to jump in here. And John can add something if he likes. But remember that the Aimco is largely hedged against change in cap rates by reason of its long-dated weighted average maturities. So for example, the change in interest rates year-to-date reduces the burden of our liabilities by about $200 million or $1.50 a share. And so there's a significant offset, if cap rates go up. As John mentioned earlier, at this point, we don't see a change in cap rates. But just remember with respect to Aimco that we're largely hedged against those interest rate changes.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And so do you think, though, that if you start to see cap rates move that these might be more impacted by -- just because of higher reliance on leveraged buyers in that marketplace?","Terry Considine","I think it could be certainly, but it's also true that a similar change in -- the same amount of cap rate change would be a larger percentage impact from a lower cap rate base. So the impact on valuation is a little unpredictable, and I wouldn't actually expect great differences between the 2.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just second question is on the other income per unit line. That's been -- that grew quite a bit this quarter. I think it's been for a couple of quarters that, that growth rate has been elevated. Can you just talk about what sort of fees and services are driving that up? And should we expect that type of growth to continue?","Keith M. Kimmel","Karin, this is Keith. I'll take that question. I just want to put in context our other income growth represents 10% of our total revenue. And essentially what we're taking advantage of is the value propositions that we're offering to our residents. And it's around a variety of things like pets and parking and storage and a myriad of things. And while they're willing to pay for those things, we're going to continue to take advantage of it.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So do you think -- are we starting to hit harder comps on that? Or do you think we should still see double-digit increases there for the next couple of quarters?","Keith M. Kimmel","Well we will get to a point where we start getting harder comps, and I wouldn't expect that for a long distance out, but we're going to continue to take advantage while it's there.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, just to close, thank you again for your interest in Aimco. We're on track. We feel good about our plan. We feel delighted by our team. And I hope you'll join me in congratulating John and Patti on their expanded responsibilities. Have a great weekend.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, please go head.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgments, including projections related to 2014 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's Web site.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in Charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco.","Last year was another good year for Aimco across each of our five areas of strategic focus, property operations, redevelopment, portfolio management, balance sheet and culture. In property operations, Keith and his team focused on customer satisfaction and disciplined cost control producing solid 5.5% year-over-year NOI growth.","In redevelopment, we finished the year on-time on-budget. Looking back over the past three years we have invested more than $0.5 billion in redevelopment and development at free cash flow internal rates of return north of 8%. We\u2019ve invested much of this capital in locations that are quite special in the West in Marin County in the Bay Area and in Venice in La Jolla in Southern California, and in the East in Boston\u2019s West End and Philadelphia\u2019s Center City. The rents for these properties are also special averaging about $2,800 a month and what is even more special is that we\u2019re trading value equal to $0.30 or more for each dollar of redevelopment and development spending.","With annual redevelopment and development spending of $200 million to $300 million, we have the opportunity to add $0.50 each year to our net asset value per share. One final redevelopment note, in November John yielded redevelopment leadership to Patti Fielding, an 18-year Aimco veteran. Patti will build on John\u2019s excellent work and I predict continued good news from Aimco redevelopment. This change will free more of John\u2019s time for portfolio management.","Turning to portfolio management, John and his team working within our pair trade discipline continue their remarkable repositioning of the Aimco portfolio. In just the past three years, they have sold 27,000 apartment homes more than 130 properties for $1.7 billion almost all of our C rated properties and cut in half our allocation to affordable properties, which is now only about 5% of gross asset value. As I\u2019ve mentioned a moment ago, they reinvested the proceeds in redevelopment and development and also in property acquisitions that we valued more highly than the paired property traded such that A and B rated properties are now balanced in our portfolio at roughly 40% each such that average revenue per apartment home increased by one-third to $1,670 a month such that operating margin as measured at the free cash flow line increased by 10%.","On the balance sheet, Ernie and his team have accomplished the transformation rivaling what John and his team have achieved with the portfolio. Over the same three years they reduced leveraged EBITDA from 9.5 times to 7 times and created a pool of unencumbered properties valued at more than a $1 billion. After our January equity offering, leveraged net of cash is about 35% of Aimco market capitalization while liquidity is excellent with 2015 redevelopment and development spending funded from committed loans and pending property sales leaving more than half a billion dollar available on the Aimco credit facility.","Now is the culture, it\u2019s my opinion and the fervent belief of the entire Aimco team that our culture is the key to our success. Our emphasis on a collaborative respectful and performance oriented culture is what enables the continuing transformation of the Aimco business all while maintaining the high moral and team engagement that led to Denver Post once again to recognize Aimco as one of the top places to work in Colorado. I thank my colleagues and the entire Aimco team for their hard work to achieve these excellent results with appreciation of last year\u2019s good results and the expectation of another good year in 2015, the Aimco Board of Directors last week increased the quarterly dividend by 8%. Our plan and our commitment for 2015, is for more of the same.","Now, I would like to turn the call to Keith Kimmel, Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thank, Terry. We feel good about our 2014 results. Our onsite teams execute our plan with enthusiasm and continued commitment to world-class customer service. As a result, we achieved renewal rate increases averaging 5.2% for the year with continued low turnover, where those leases expired and were renewed. New leases were signed at rates that were on average 3.7% higher than the expiring leases. Our blended lease rate increased 4.4% for the year creating a solid book of business that we will earn in over the course of 2015.","Turning to our fourth quarter results, new lease rates were 90 basis points higher than their expiring leases. Renewal rate increases were up 4.9% with particular strength in the Bay Area, Denver, Miami, and Boston. And blended lease rates were up 2.9% an acceleration of nearly 100 basis points versus prior year. Turnover for the quarter was 46.8%, 20 basis points better year-over-year.","Of the customers who decided to move out 21% were for career moves, 19% did not renew due to price and 16% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. We continue to be successful in replacing move outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average income of those new customers who moved in during the fourth quarter was 131,000. The median income was 80,000 resulting in a consistent rent-to-income ratio of 21%. Year-over-year the median income of our new residents was up 17% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. This result is driven by an improvement in our portfolio and resident base.","Looking at our 10 largest markets which make up three quarters of our revenue, the top performers had revenue increases from nearly 6% to 11% for the quarter. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Denver, Miami, and Orange County. Our steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of over 4.5% to better than 5.5%, were Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and San Diego. And rounding out our 10 largest markets, we had Washington DC, which was essentially flat down 10 basis points.","As we look ahead to early first quarter results, January blended lease rates were up 2.1% with new leases up 20 basis points and renewals up 4.2%. January\u2019s average daily occupancy was on plan at 95.5% and February and March renewal offers went up with 4.5% to 7% increases. 2015 revenue growth and our top-10 markets can be broken into three tiers, at the top of the list representing one-third of our revenue with forecasted growth between 5% and 7%, we have the Bay Area, Miami, Denver, and Los Angeles. The midrange markets with forecasted growth between 3% and 4% are San Diego, Orange County, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. And rounding up the top-10, we have Washington DC forecasted to be similar to 2014 and with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco\u2019s success.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. Today, I will recap our 2014 portfolio management and investment activities and provide some specifics around our plans for 2015. As a reminder, our portfolio management activities are driven by paired trades where the projected free cash flow internal rate of return of an investment is greater than that of the property or properties sold to fund the investment and portfolio quality is enhanced. As we execute this strategy, we use the same 10 year free cash flow internal rate of return model reflecting cash flows after capital spending across all our investment activities.","During 2014, we sold 30 properties about 9,000 apartment homes generating gross proceeds to Aimco of $690 million. We sold 24 of our lowest rated conventional properties with average revenues per apartment home of $926, 44% below the average of our retained portfolio. Among the properties we sold were the last we held in Houston, Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Orlando, Lansing, Michigan and Fort Wayne, Indiana. We also continued the sell one of affordable portfolio with the sale of six properties and our partnership interest in 10 others. On average the properties sold in 2014 had a free cash flow cap rate of 5.3%, and we held these properties for the next 10 years we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow on internal rate of return of about 6.5%.","Proceeds from these sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions, and property upgrades at a weighted free cash flow average free cash flow internal rate of return about 300 basis points higher than the property sold to fund them. On the investment side of our paired trade, we invested $35 million in redevelopment projects during the fourth quarter, enhancing seven communities with a total of more than 3,100 apartment homes and bringing our total redevelopment investment for the year to $182 million. During the quarter we completed redevelopment work at the Palazzo in Los Angeles and are nearing the completion of multi-year projects at Lincoln Place located in Venice, California and Preserve at Marin located in Marin County, California.","As Terry mentioned, Patti Fielding is heading up our redevelopment program and under her leadership during the fourth quarter, Aimco approved a plan to continue the redevelopment of the Sterling located in Center City, Philadelphia. This next phase of the project will include the redevelopment of an additional four floors with 105 apartment homes. We expect to invest $11 million in this next phase bringing our total projected investment in the redevelopment of the Sterling to $36 million. During 2014, we also invested a total $47 million in our One Canal development in Boston where the steel topped out a few weeks ago and construction continues on-plan. We expect initial apartment home deliveries at One Canal in early 2016.","On the acquisitions front, during 2014 we purchased six operating properties with a total of 1,200 apartment homes for a combined investment of nearly $300 million. Three of these acquisitions in San Jose, California, the Buckhead Area of Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado were completed in the fourth quarter and are detailed in our earnings release. During the fourth quarter, we also acquired 2.4 acres of land in the heart of downtown La Jolla, California, overlooking the iconic La Jolla Cove. The property is zoned for multi-family and mixed-use purposes and is currently occupied by three small retail buildings and a limited-service hotel which is managed for Aimco by a third-party. We plan to redevelop this property in coming years and consider its current use and income producing land bank.","Moving onto our plans for this year, we will continue to follow our paired trade approach to portfolio management with the sale of lower rated properties and reinvestment of sale proceeds in properties where rents, long-term growth rates, operating margins and free cash flow internal rates of return exceed the comparable metrics on the properties sold. Our base plan for 2015 is to sell $225 million to $275 million worth of properties generating net proceeds to Aimco of $130 million to $140 million. We expect most of our sales activity to occur in the first half of the year with one transaction already closed and others well underway. Under this base plan, we anticipate reinvesting the proceeds from these sales to fund redevelopment and property upgrades. As has been the case for the last few years, we will continue to look for opportunities to upgrade our portfolio through selective pair trade acquisitions. If we are successful, we will adjust our guidance accordingly.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernie Freedman","Thanks John. Today I'll first spend a few moments on our fourth quarter results and then second I'll provide some details around our outlook for 2015. You can find all of our provided projections for the year, as well as a reconciliation between 2014 and 2015 results on Pages 6 to 7 of our earnings release.","Regarding fourth quarter 2014 results, fourth quarter AFFO was $0.43 per share which was also the midpoint of our guidance range. FFO was $0.54 per share, $0.01 below the midpoint of our guidance. The variance to guidance was due to $0.02 of operations outperformance offset by $0.02 of acquisition costs and $0.01 related to higher incentive compensation for 2014 as a result of outperformance across the company. We exceeded our guidance for same-store operating results with full year revenues coming in 4.5% higher than 2013, offset by expense growth of 2.3% leading to NOI growth of 5.5%. Regarding the balance sheet, our unencumbered pool grew further to over $1 billion. We now have an unencumbered pool that meets Fitch\u2019s identified requirements to consider us investment grade.","Looking forward to 2015 and operations we anticipate same-store revenue growth between 3.75% and 4.5%. As Keith noted, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 4.4% in 2014, so half of that we will earn in during 2015. We expect to achieve blended lease rate increases in 2015 similar to 2014. Other income which makes up about 10% of our total property revenues is expected to increase at a rate lower than rent growth. The combination of these items and our expectation of similar occupancy rates for the year provides for a result approximating the midpoint of our guidance range.","On the expense side, we anticipate expenses to increase between 2.5% and 3%. Real-estate taxes continue to increase as real-estate values continue to increase. We anticipate that real-estate taxes will increase 4% to 5%. Controllable operating expenses or all expenses exclusive of taxes, utilities and assurance are projected to increase about 1.5%. We will certainly look to see if we can beat those predictions. These increases in both revenues and expenses lead to our expectations of NOI growth between 4% and 5.5%.","Regarding our portfolio, we ended 2014 with average revenues per apartment home of about $1,670 a 14% increase from 2013. We anticipate with the combination of market rent growth and our portfolio management activities, average revenues per apartment home will increase 8% to about $1,800 per month by year-end. As John noted, we begin 2015 with most of our planned property sales expected to close in the first half of the year. As a result, and together with committed loans the funding plans for our redevelopment and development activities are largely in place.","Regarding our balance sheet, our plan is the same as it has been for the last several years further strengthen the balance sheet and continue to work toward an investment grade rating. We've already taken steps to reduce leverage in 2015 using the proceeds from the January sale of 9.43 million shares of common equity. Let me take a moment to walk through the anticipated use of the $357 million of proceeds generated. We repaid in January the outstanding balance on our line of credit which was about $112 million. In addition, we anticipate the repayment of our CRA preferreds before the end of this quarter with a balance outstanding of $27 million. With the remainder of the proceeds, we expect to repay $102 million of property debt maturing later this year and to fund free and clear versus with leveraged neutral property debt our 2015 investment and redevelopment and property upgrades.","We anticipate that leveraged EBITDA will remain in the high 6s throughout 2015 as it is now and project that leveraged EBITDA will decrease to the mid 6s during 2016. Leverage to market capitalization approximates 36%. And lastly, our offsite costs continue to decline as the scale of our business changes. We have provided guidance for property management, investment management and G&A expense. These items together provide the basis for our expectation that full year AFFO per share will be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90 up 10% at the midpoint. We expect FFO to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22. And finally as Terry mentioned, we announced last week our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.26 to $0.28 per share.","With that we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Operator, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico at UBS.","Nick Yulico","Can you just talk about the next wave of the redevelopment opportunities what projects you think might make sense when you have that 2015 to 2017 slide in your presentations for the future opportunities will you just remind us of how you're thinking about those projects?","Ernie Freedman","Sure Nick this is Ernie I\u2019ll provide some details and can potentially also pass it over to Patti to provide further details. We\u2019ve talked about before one of the lessons we learned with redevelopment over the last couple of years is that we have the great opportunity to announce something in phases that is actually the right approach to go from the perspective of due to phase, see if it works, see if it underwrites, see if we get the rent we get, see if we get the cost expectations that we have and move forward and Sterling is a great example of that from this last quarter, where we had very good take on the first-batch of apartment home that we put out there for redevelopment it was three floors, we met our cost expectations, we met our timing expectations and we beat our expectations for rents. And thus we announced another four floors here.","Sterling now has about 30 floors of residential and so certainly if Sterling continues to go well and I think we talk about in our release Nick you could certainly see Sterling ending up being a project that is upwards of $70 million to $80 million if we go forward with it. So that\u2019s certainly one that is front and center in the pipeline going forward, it's next door neighbor in Philadelphia in Center City, Park Towne is the exact same thing in Park Towne we announced in 2014 that we\u2019re going to take down one of the four towers that work is progressing well, it is progressing on-time and on budget at this point. And if that goes well, you could certainly see that we would move forward with another tower, if not all four towers there. So those two projects go certainly front and center for us in terms of redevelopment opportunities here over the next couple of years.","We continue to see opportunities in our West Coast properties for instance at Palazzo, where we\u2019ve completed work on penthouse units and we\u2019re determining whether we want to do further work with our partner JPMorgan on the rest of that building as you know with our Palazzo joint venture we have the Palazzo East, as well as one other property too. And so there is lots of opportunities there. In Chicago, we\u2019ve talked about our project at Yorktown, where we can redevelop the property where it currently stands and we have a piece of vacant land that if the redevelopment of the current property goes well, we could actually add more units there also, those are just a few examples that we\u2019re looking at, we disclosed a few others in some of our investor materials lately and Patti do you want to add anything else on top of that?","Patti Fielding","I mean you\u2019ve covered all the major ones that we\u2019re looking out for in the near future.","Ernie Freedman","What I\u2019d say Nick is we feel highly confident that we can continue to spend $200 million to $300 million a year in redevelopment and development activities, generate the kind of returns that Terry talked about the $0.30 to $0.35 of additional value on each dollar spent and really the governor for us is risk appetite and manpower in terms of how much we want to do at one time.","Nick Yulico","And then should we now be crossing off the Manhattan, Tempo project there was an article this week it said may have had it sounds like you had adverse ruling for converting affordable to market rate units there, if you could just talk about that? And then remind us if any of this other future redevelopment you have across the country has any that issue where you're converting affordable to market rate and where is that might be a risk of facing some sort of adverse city decision on that process? Thanks.","John Bezzant","Sure, Nick, John Bezzant here. Really Tempo is a bit of a unique, New York is a bit of a unique animal and in that regulatory environment where you go through these processes, what we would ask to do there frankly was to upgrade the building in its entirety and do work within there in order to get permission to do that because there are controlled and stabilize units within the building and we had to go in for an application for the certificate of no harassment. What came back on that really doesn\u2019t change our long-term game plan for the Tempo which is a great asset up on West 73rd in the upper west side, it's a fantastic piece of property in a great location and most of that building is market rate and we will continue to operate as market rate and we will continue to respect the rates and treat our tenants well throughout the building, regardless of their rent stabilization status. And what we will look for is down the road, we will look for another opportunity to go and make the improvements to the building, but this was not a mass conversion of stabilized tenants to market rate tenants, this was intended to an upgrade of the entire building and those tenants were going to stay there under their existing agreements as you may expect the press accounts of it we are a little bit slanted shall we say.","Nick Yulico","So sounds like overall though that redevelopment opportunity is probably off the table right now?","John Bezzant","For the near-term, yes. Certainly off the table on your regulatory framework for at least three years.","Nick Yulico","Okay, but that issue doesn\u2019t really pop up at any your other redevelopments in this future pipeline?","John Bezzant","No it does not.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Terry, big picture question for you, you talked about the positive stems and success as you had in terms of improving the portfolio and balance sheet over the past few years, so what are the goals going forward?","Terry Considine","Nick more of the same we are highly focused on having the right customers and serving them well. And so we track closely the improvement in income and financial condition of the new tenants we're attracting which track closely their satisfaction with the services we're providing we're very pleased to attract it and publish it by the way buy property online. So you can see the good, the bad, the ugly of how we do that\u2019s where we start. We're very focused on control and we think there is continuing opportunities to bring operating costs out of our business.","On the portfolio side we think we have opportunities to continue to upgrade. The wonderful disciple of the pair trade is that it can set a high hurdle sometime but makes decision making easy because in the end when John presents an opportunity at the investment committee the question is would we rather own X or Y. Would we rather own a property in San Jose or Buckhead or Boulder as in the fourth quarter are the properties we sold in Orlando and Jacksonville. And so our appetite for acquisitions is disciplined by that but if we could find the opportunities we would continue the very aggressive transformation of the Aimco portfolio.","On the balance sheet we're getting to close where our goals our we\u2019ve set a goal of seven times EBITA for leverage over the course of the cycle which means at this time while the times are good would like to be lower and Ernie has pointed out that we've a fixed handle today and that will drip down over the next year or two. But the burden of reducing leverage is largely behind us and we'll continue to focus on the quality of the leverage the duration and the non-recourse and try to lower its cost offsite we continue to lower our cost I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s noticed but in the 2015 guidance you'll see that our cost offsite are lower in '15 than in '14 were lower in '14 than in '13, lower in \u201913 than in '12 we'll continue to try to spend shareholders money frugally. And of course culture is very important to us so we continue to work on making this a better team. Not just with best possible people but those people working in the best possible way together and the sum of all of that is what we tried to do in '14 and what we expect to do this year.","Nick Joseph","And then in terms of operations, can you talk about are you expecting any difference between your A properties and your B properties in 2015 in terms of the rate of same-store revenue growth?","Keith Kimmel","Nick this is Keith. As we look at A's and B's really what's important for our A's is that they are market specific and so when we look at our A's being in Miami and Los Angeles and things of that nature they will obviously perform as those particular markets move. But as a general rule the A's and B's we've looked at over the past quarter and they\u2019re pretty much very close to each other.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Oppenheim at Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering I guess just that last comment in terms of the A's and B's performing solidly. As we think about the cycle over the next couple of years if we assume any normalization in terms of turnover and in terms for a move out for ownership do you have any worry in terms of the A's with potentially more move outs for that?","Terry Considine","Dan I think that\u2019s an excellent question and insightful because each price point has its own pluses and minus and one of the risk at the A price point is that it is more subject to competitive new buildings. And we have increased our allocation to A\u2019s so as I mentioned today I think the actual number is something like 44% of our portfolio would be indentified as A and we want to balance that with a roughly equal allocation to B\u2019s. We also want to diversify our risk to oversupply in any one market by allocation across multiple markets. So it's a concern and it's something that we watch very carefully in our portfolio strategy. But it's something we have planned for and therefore we're not alarmed about it's part of the business.","Dan Oppenheim","And I was just wondering about the January trend I think some others have talked about the trends in DC for January it seems there is an uptick sufficient uptick in January that\u2019s helping a lot of the numbers. Can you just quantify what you're seeing in DC relative to the other markets for January?","Keith Kimmel","Dan this is Keith I'll just let me walk through DC. We really break it into two different markets Suburban Maryland and Suburban Virginia and what we've been seeing in Maryland is little more strengthen than Suburban Virginia and that\u2019s really a product of the new supply in Alexandria and so while there is definitely seen some things that are improving a little bit there is definitely some more supply to be absorbed as we go through \u201915.","Operator","The next question comes from Jana Galan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","I was curious on your outlook for San Diego and Orange County it seems a little bit lighter than what peers are expecting for that region, I was just curious if there was some unique you were seeing in your submarkets?","Keith Kimmel","Jana, this is Keith, let me just I will walk through San Diego and Orange County, starting in San Diego, San Diego we had a solid year at basically 5% and we anticipate that we\u2019ll see something similar in \u201915 and it potentially could be even a little bit better. The Orange Country number what I would tell you there is just that our community there is really competes directly with the Uruguayan company and there is a couple of new things are coming on early in which we anticipate we will have a short-term absorption in the end of course we\u2019ll be very well positioned as we accelerate out of that. So we have no concerns there and feel very good about Orange County.","Jana Galan","And then a quick question for Ernie just given the level of disposition activity in 2014 and depending on how much was completed this year, you previously mentioned it may require special dividend, I just curios if there is any update there?","Ernie Freedman","Yes, Jana, unfortunately I can\u2019t give an update beyond the fact that we do still think there is a possibly we\u2019ll have to do a special dividend it\u2019s exactly what you said based on the activity we completed in 2015 but I can\u2019t give you an update. We had talked previously about the potential that that could be some combination of cash and stock for that special dividend. And that we would come to determination and see that what\u2019s going to make the most sense for us to do a cash special dividend. So it would be a second half event for the year and likely with the dividend that would be paid in November and as we get closer to that point in time, I can be more specific about how much that would be Jana, but again we do anticipate that would be a cash dividend for the special.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky","John or Terry, you\u2019ve answered Nick\u2019s question about strategy, can you just talk a little bit about the Aimco acquisition strategy going forward just in the light of the pickup in the fourth quarter activity as well as I think real estate allergic to suggest that you guys were in the bidding there for the Gables portfolio, so just curious how we should look at that acquisition strategy now that\u2019s gained a little bit momentum over the last six months?","Terry Considine","Mike, we did same in 2014 as we did in 2013 as we did in 2012 and as we expect to do in 2015 which is that we look at a lot of deals and we compare them to the properties that we might sell to fund them. And if across a wide number of metrics, we like better the one we might buy to the one we might sell we go ahead and we have a successful pair trade. I would like to put that flurry of activity in context that we bought last year I forgot 2% or 3% of our gross asset value, so we\u2019re not expanding assets at a rapid clip, but we\u2019re expanding and I think that\u2019s positive because we\u2019re expanding through paired trades where we feel that what we\u2019re getting is better than what we\u2019re giving up.","In terms of the strategy of those investments, we have identified market allocations which are quite transparent to the street. We would like to be more invested in Washington DC for example and in Seattle and a little bit more in the Bay Area and we\u2019d like to reallocate capital within the Washington market and within the Boston market. But all of that is under the constraint of we have to do in a way that\u2019s accretive to shareholders, so it\u2019s not just spending money it\u2019s spending money in a way that creates value. And in answering Nick\u2019s question about the future what I would like emphasize is that we want to be balanced not just across markets but also across price points. We don\u2019t want have a portfolio that\u2019s all A, we don\u2019t want to have a portfolio that\u2019s all B. We want to have a balance that allows us to serve higher quality customers whose economic prospects are such that they will be more stable in downturns and better able to pay higher rents in good times. John, do you want to add to that?","John Bezzant","Yes, just a couple of things I think I will add one clarification in your early remarks you mentioned Washington DC, we want to increase our allocation too and that\u2019s our resort market for us. New York City would be -- yes within the market we want to re-trade in DC and we are under allocated in New York, Seattle and we would continue to look there and obviously we haven\u2019t bought in Seattle as we\u2019re seeing a lot of new product come into the market there and we\u2019re seeing some rather aggressive pricing we have elected not to buy there and haven\u2019t seen what we would determine a good paired trade. And then just on the one other change that you mentioned Michael, in terms of the Gables transaction, really it plays into that same category. We look at a lot things we like to look almost everything that moves out there in the market and really look at it in terms of our portfolio and whether we can make a paired trade that makes sense for that as an upgrade to us for our portfolio our allocations our markets that we\u2019re in all those kind of and so we did -- yes we did take a look at it and ultimately we decided that it was going to both price at a level that was not attractive to us and that it wasn\u2019t the right paired trade for us to make.","Michael Salinsky","Just as a follow-up then Ernie not to leave you out, just given the progress you made on the balance sheet there, what are you hearing from the rating agencies right now and then also as we think about the mix of dispositions in '15 that are targeted how does that breakout between conventional versus affordable?","Ernie Freedman","Sure and Mike it will be okay if you let me answer but I appreciate if you let me come back in. With regards to the rating agencies, we've dialog with them quarterly Patti Fielding lead that efforts for us here at Aimco they're certainly well aware at Fitch that we've exceeded what they've asked us to do with regards to unencumbered pool which was the last hurdle we needed to hit and they're currently underwriting that. I wish I could tell you more specifically the timing on when we might end up getting some good news from them, but it's really in their hands and we will do what we can to push that forward and answer any of their requests as quickly as possible.","With SMP the discussions we've had is around the fact that they certainly recognize we do things a little bit differently than most of the public companies. And they have certainly given us targets that make sense because we do things differently and specifically around something like fixed charge they understand that because of our property debt strategy that has amortization they're willing to put a lower target on us or requirements for investment grade versus other companies that don\u2019t have that. We continue that dialog certainly the equity offering we did in January helps with both of those agencies and puts us much quicker on the path to getting to places that they'd asked us to get to. And we're hopeful that can persuade them to again get us to a different conclusion here sooner than later.","With regards to dispositions Mike almost all -- it's very limited amount of disposition this year if I recall correctly I think it is about conventional assets that we've built in the guidance and I don\u2019t think it's more than one or so one or two affordable assets -- two affordable assets there so it's very much concentrated on the conventional side as Terry mentioned our affordable both GAV and NAV today as well as NOI contribution is right around 5% to 6% and that continues to just slowly melt away year-by-year and I think and that will continue over the next few years.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Bragg at Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","When I look at the -- your guidance page on Page 6 under transactions with the disposition that you've listed here does this amount of dispositions tie-in with zero acquisitions and if you do acquisitions you would therefore do more dispositions is that right way to think about it?","Ernie Freedman","Yes Dave the right way is that if John is successful in finding paired trade opportunities you would see our dispositions guidance go up. That said, we do expect that John may be successful in getting something done we're not prepared to give guidance on that, but we do have the flexibility to fund maybe roughly from a cash flow perspective of about $50 million worth of acquisitions based on disposition guidance if we don\u2019t find that acquisition opportunity we'll come in at the low-end of this range if we do find that kind of acquisition opportunity we'll come in at the high-end of the range and if John is able to source more deals that makes sense for us from a paired trade perspective then you're absolutely right you would see our disposition guidance change throughout the year.","Dave Bragg","And just following-up on the answer to I think it was Salinsky's question, how does the pair trade approach work for a very large transaction something multi billion dollars which seems as though you've looked at some might call it transformational, how would the pair trade strategy work there would you sell several billion dollars of assets at the same time?","Ernie Freedman","David it'd be speculative to talk about a hypothetical we chose not to do it but the options that would have been available in that or in any other large transaction could have ranged from a joint venture to equity issuance to sale of more assets to just a wide range of different possible capital structures but it's really moved because it didn\u2019t work and we didn\u2019t do it.","Terry Considine","And Dave I'd also say that Aimco grew by doing large transactions and often chasm is a perfect example. We bought a huge portfolio for about 15 properties and so if any large transformational as the word you used or just large transaction in general just because you're buying something large it doesn\u2019t mean you plan on keeping all of that at once and Aimco certainly have the history of calling things and looking for opportunities so that's another way also to potentially fund something so as Terry said all options are on the table.","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions and I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Considine for closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you operator and thank all of you for your interest in Aimco. We had a great year in '14 we look forward to a great year in '15 many of you we hope to see in a few weeks at the conference in Florida.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you, and good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment including projections related to 2017 and 2018 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations, John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I'll now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa. And good morning to all of you on this call. I appreciate your interest in Aimco. And 2016 was a good year for Aimco by many metrics.","As my colleagues will discuss in detail, property operations were solid, portfolio quality was improved, our balance sheet was strengthened, and our business was profitable. Adjusted funds from operation, our measure for current return, was up 5%. And economic income per share defined as cash dividends plus the change in net asset value, our measure for total return, provided a 15% return on our starting net asset value. In short, 2016 results reflected the steady execution of the Aimco strategy which has produced consistent improvements to our business. For this I thank my teammates and say to them, well done.","Looking forward, 2017 seems likely to be of more difficult year for the apartment business. Economic growth is projected to be positive but still slow, political turbulence increases the risk of economic dislocation. The supply of new apartments continues to increase and there are many markets where new lease rent increases have slowed or turned to negative. Inflation and a number of locales minimum wage legislation, increased costs and compressed margins. These factors make us cautious. But none of this is new, at Aimco where we have been preparing for the past many years for this completely normal and predictable phase in local building cycles.","We have emphasized customer selection in quality. Our average new customer is financially stable, has an annual income approaching six figures, and has ample financial wherewithal to pay rent including reasonable increases. We have high measured and publicly reported customer satisfaction and relatively high customer retention rates. We have made regular investments in the physical condition of our properties. Our portfolio is broadly diversified by markets and by price points, roughly 50% A's and 50% B's and C's. And we have a safe balance sheet with abundant liquidity and a business plan not especially dependent on access to capital markets, nor very much affected by fluctuations in interest rates or share prices.","That said, about one quarter of our capital is invested in markets at A price points in submarkets where competitive new supply is more than 2% of existing stock. We expect these properties to face increased competitive pressure on new lease rates. We also expect the lease-up of some of our redevelopment properties will be made more difficult because of competing new supply. Happily we see numerous opportunities for offsetting improvements elsewhere in our business; for example, by operating efficiencies, by slowing the redevelopment pace. Most importantly, we have a high achieving team with the experience and commitment required to navigate whatever stormy waters may be ahead.","For this I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco team mates, both here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.","And now for a more detailed report on fourth quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter in operations with revenues up 4.4%, expenses down 80 basis points and net operating income up 6.6%. Turnover for the quarter was 51% equal to that of the fourth quarter in 2015. Move out reasons for the quarter are unchanged versus recent results or our long-term averages. And our residents give us better than a four-star rating in customer satisfaction for the thirteenth consecutive quarter.","Looking at rates which transacted in the quarter, blended lease rates were up 1%, with renewal rents having solid increases of 4.8%. We saw particular strength in Atlanta, Seattle and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 6% to 7% percent compared to the expiring leases. Were those leases expired and were not renewed, our new leases were 1.9% below the prior lease as we intentionally traded rate for occupancy while navigating choppy waters in a few markets. This strategy resulted in a 40 basis point improvement and average daily occupancy for the portfolio. The trade was worth an additional $500,000 in revenue growth for the quarter.","We particularly focused the strategy in Chicago, the Bay Area in Miami. With year-over-year average daily occupancy increases averaging 100 basis points per market while rates were 5% down on average. The balance of the portfolio averaged down about a half point new lease pricing for the quarter.","Turning to the fourth quarter revenue growth. Our 12 target markets were up 4.5% for the quarter. The top performers had revenue increases for more than 6% to 16% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle, followed by the Bay Area, Denver, San Diego and Boston. Our strong performers which had revenue growth of more than 4% to nearly 5% were Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Our steady markets with roughly 3% to 3.5% revenue growth were Washington D.C., New York and Chicago. And finally, with revenue growth of almost 2% we had Miami.","Looking towards 2017 revenue growth; our expectations for this year in our 12 target markets could be broken into three Tiers. At the top of the list with forecasted growth better than 4% we have Seattle, Boston, and San Diego. The mid-range market with forecasted growth of 3% or better, we have Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington D.C. Rounding out our 12 target markets with growth between 2% and 3%, we have Miami, the Bay Area and Philadelphia.","Finally and looking at our early first quarter 2017 results, preliminary January blended lease rates are up 2.3% with renewals up 5%, 20 basis points better than last month. New leases improved versus December to down 30 basis points year-over-year. And when comparing our new lease performance of A's versus B's, our A's are down 2.3% for the month with B's up nearly 1% for January. January's average daily occupancy was 96%, flat to prior year and February and March renewal offers went out with 4% to 6% increases, similar to those sent for January.","And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco success, I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith and good morning all. During the fourth quarter we sold four properties, for the year we sold eight properties with about 3,300 apartment homes are gross proceeds to Aimco of $529 million.","On average, the property sold in 2016 had a free cash flow cap rate of 4.9% and had we held these properties for the next 10 years, we would have expected them to generate a free cash flow internal rate of return of about 6.6%. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested in redevelopment and development projects, acquisitions and property upgrades at a weighted average free cash flow internal rate of return, about 300 basis points higher than the properties sold to fund them.","We invested $183 million in redevelopment and development during 2016. Most of this investment was in our phase projects in Philadelphia, Park Towne Place and the Sterling. At Park Towne Place, we completed construction in the south and east towers; in October, we began construction in the north tower. As of year-end, 81% of the completed apartment homes were occupied. We also continued the final phase of our redevelopment of the Sterling and 92% of the completed apartment homes were occupied at year end. We expect to complete work at the Sterling later this quarter on time and on budget.","During 2016 we started redevelopment at four communities; Bay Parc Plaza in Miami, Saybrook Pointe in San Jose California, Yorktown in Suburban Chicago, and the second phase of redevelopment at the Palazzo at Park La Brea in West Los Angeles. Details of these projects can be found on supplemental schedule 10 to our fourth quarter release. In 2016 we achieved NOI stabilization at three redeveloped communities in coastal California; Lincoln Place in Venice, Ocean House on Prospect in La Jolla, and Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera. Combined redevelopment of these communities resulted in value creation of approximately $170 million, at 30% on Aimco's investment in the projects.","We also completed development of our One Canal Community in the Bulfinch Triangle area of Boston. Thanks to an excellent execution by Keith and his team, 86% of the apartment homes at Once Canal were occupied at year end, a pace that is several months ahead of our underwriting. And finally as to 2016 activity, we closed on the $320 million acquisition of Indigo located in Redwood City, California last August. Keith and his team have exceeded expectations for the lease-up of this community as well. At year end, 77% of the apartment's homes were occupied, also several months ahead of our underwritten pace.","Across our major lease-up properties, our Park Towne Place, the Sterling, One Canal and Indigo; we ended January with limited remaining lease-up exposure. Of the more than 1,700 completed apartment homes, only 267 or about 15% are vacant and our rent to these properties continue to track our underwriting.","Looking ahead to 2017; our capital investment outlook for the year remains focused on value creation within our portfolio. We plan to invest $170 million to $290 million in redevelopment and property upgrades over the course of the year, with the upper end of the range dependent upon continued success in achieving targeted rental increases. We expect to complete that One Canal lease-up this quarter and for Indigo to follow in the second quarter. And while we are not contemplating any acquisitions at this time, we continue to look for opportunities to make a creative paired trades that would improve the quality of our portfolio.","And with that I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thank you, John. Today I'd like to spend a few moments on our 2016 results after which I'll provide some details around the 2017 outlook and 2018 forecast that we published yesterday with our earnings release.","First, 2016. In operations, Keith and his team delivered solid full year results, 2016 same-store revenue grew at 4.7%, expense growth was held to 1.4% which drove same-store NOI growth 6.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of our beginning of year guidance. Additionally, as John just discussed, the team achieved excellent results that are lease-up communities adding $2 million more to 2016 net operating income than originally expected. These successes contributed to year-over-year FFO growth of 4% and AFFO growth of 5%, each ahead of our beginning of the year expectations.","As for the balance sheet, year-end leverage to EBITDA was 6.7 times consistent with our beginning of year guidance. And during 2016, we lowered our weighted average cost of debt capital by closing $394 million of fixed rates amortizing property loans that have a weighted average term to maturity of 9.4 years and a blended interest rate of 3.19%. We also took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment and put refunding plans in place for $89 million of our 2017 property debt maturities. We expect to refund the remaining $171 million of 2017 maturities consisting of seven loans with a weighted average loan to value of 33% in ordinary course.","Finally, in December we restructured our bank line extending its maturity to January 2022 and lowering our borrowings. At year end, our $600 million line was largely undrawn and we held an unencumbered pool of communities valued at $1.6 billion. In short, 2016 was a good year for Aimco. Given these positive results and our expectations for 2017, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. As we look ahead, prospects for the Aimco business remained good. Concurrent with yesterday's release, we provided guidance for 2017 and financial forecast for 2018. It is important to remember that the 2018 forecast is our financial model based on third-party [ph].","Our 2018 guidance and actual results are likely to be somewhat different. Today where we would track at your ago forecast for 2017, we see many consistencies but also four important differences that are reflected in our 2017 guidance. First, lower same-store NOI growth. Second, increased contributions to 2016 lease-ups. Third, a slower pace for certain redevelopments based on caution about market. And fourth, increased capital replacements spending. When comparing 2016 actual results and our 2017 guidance, the important differences are same-store. We anticipate same-store revenue growth between 3.25% and 4.25% reflecting an expectation of slower lease rate growth in 2017 compared to 2016.","We anticipate expenses to increase by 2.5% to 3%, a faster increase than in 2016. These increases drive our expectations of 2017, net operating income growth will be between 3.5% and 5%. We anticipate the increased 2017 NOI contribution from the lease-up of Indigo, One Canal and Vivo [ph] to be $0.13 per share, up $0.12 year-over-year. We expect the contribution from non-core earnings to decline by $0.10 to $0.12 per share compared to 2016 as we continue our gradual exit from the low income housing tax credit business and as we complete certain redevelopments that have generated historic tax credits.","Finally, we expect reduced outside costs that come with our simpler business model. As the complexity and the scale of our business change, we expect these costs which include property management, investment management and G&A to decline by $0.02 from 2016 to 2017. As a result and at the midpoints of the ranges of our guidance, we 2017 funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations to be $2.44 and $2.12 per share respectively.","Now as to our model for 2018, based on third-party projections we are forecasting increasing AFFO to a range of $2.17 and $2.31 per share driven primarily by the same four factors influencing 2017's result. First, same-store NOI growth of 3.5% to 5%, similar to what we expect for 2017. Second, the stabilization of our 2016 lease-up properties which are forecasted to contribute an incremental $0.03 per share to 2018's results. Third, a further decline in non-core earnings of upto $0.11 per share. And fourth, further reduction of outside costs by about $0.01. I reiterate that this is just a model and we will provide formal guidance at this time next year.","So to summarize, we see over the next two years that the steady execution of our strategy will result in continued operating income growth and improved portfolio with higher average rents and wider free cash flow margins, a simpler business with higher quality earnings, lower leverage, reduced outside costs and increased FFO and AFFO per share; all accomplished without the need to access equity capital markets.","With that we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your question. Operator, I'll turn over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Juan Sanabria of Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Good morning guys, thanks for the time. I was just hoping you could speak to assumptions around 2017 new and renewal rates, particularly given the deceleration we saw in the fourth quarter to defend occupancy or to keep -- regain occupancy. So any light you could shed on that would be fantastic.","Paul Beldin","I'd be happy to. Now as we thought about our expectations for '17 we really thought about the range of potential outcomes. And so as we set our guidance range for revenue which is three in a quarter at the low end and four in a quarter at the high end, that's really framed by three factors as you all know. First, it's the impact of our earnings from our 2016 lease and activity, and that will generate about a 1.9% revenue growth in 2017. The second factor is occupancy, and so we have modeled -- and as we've thought about the range of potential outcomes to be flat at the low and midpoint of our guidance range; and in order to hit the high end of the guidance range we would probably have to have an incremental pick up in occupancy year-over-year. And then finally to address the specific question you asked on our expectations for 2017 lease rates; we expect a range of potential outcomes on a blended basis to be between about 2.7% at the low end of our guidance range and at the high end our blended lease rate would have to be about 4% which would be consistent with what we saw in 2016.","Juan Sanabria","So would the spread I guess be compressing as the year grows and particularly since you said lease between new and renewals, is that the expectation?","Paul Beldin","Juan, I think our expectation is based upon the ability to set both new and renewal rates on an asset by asset basis where it's really tough to generalize overall what we might do. I mean obviously we'll see the overall impact as we report our numbers but at this point as we're approaching the year, we're going to take those asset by asset basis.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then just last one for me, if you don't mind. Any color you can give on the trajectory of that same-store revenue growth throughout '17; is there a trough in the second half and a pickup trough in a limit point and then a pickup into the second half or is it -- a steady deceleration, any color you could provide there would be fantastic.","Paul Beldin","You know Juan, there is so much volatility quarter-over-quarter driven by factors that I would have a difficult time projecting at this point that I think our expectations really just for the year and as we see the year developing, we'll provide additional color.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Terry, as part of a two-year outlook, you put down your NAV at $52. I'm just looking at Street consensus numbers, it's around $46. So I'm wondering what in your opinion is the Street missing in terms of value versus your internal view of value?","Terry Considine","Nick, thank you very much for the question. I think the team has published a very detailed analysis and calculation of our net asset value per share, it's posted as you know on our web page. There are many analysts who have similar net asset values per share and we think theirs are more accurate. And for those who have different ones, I think they should compare them to our publication and form their own opinions as to which is right.","Nick Joseph","Is there anything when you look across those analysts that you think maybe aren't getting full value, that is being missed right now?","Terry Considine","You know how modeling goes, each people -- each analytic team has its own assumptions and some of those are objective and those should be agreed across all models; and some of those are subjective and they are entitled to their opinion.","Nick Joseph","Okay. And then -- so just taking your NAV at $52, stock trade about 15% discount today; you've talked on this call about the balance sheet, limited capital commitments, you have a reasonable dividend payout ratio; so what are your thoughts on share buybacks today?","Terry Considine","It's something we keep in our toolkit and can consider when -- under what circumstances it might be appropriate but our focus at Aimco is on operations and not what some see as financial engineering. And our focus in 2017 will be to be better operators in challenging markets, to be better redevelopers, again in challenging markets; and to manage a safe balance sheet and just focus on the execution of our long-term plan.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have a question from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it's Marshman [ph] here with Jordan. Terry, at the beginning you kind of talked a little bit about redevelopment and some of the risk that you see; broadly speaking, what would you have to see really for you to slow the redevelopment pace or what would give you pause as far as the redevelopment program?","Terry Considine","I'm very enthusiastic about our redevelopment program. It's led by very capable executive, Paddy Fielding, a long-term Aimco-ite. She's got terrific new tenants [ph] across the country. They have an emphasis on high quality and distinctive design that have been rewarded by customer acceptance. And so broadly, I'm quite enthusiastic about what we're doing in redevelopment. One of the things I like in addition to that is that redevelopment is safer than new development because you can stop. If the market at any particular time and any particular location is not meeting our expectations we can tweak it, improve our product or even just default to the base case of the occupied unit before redevelopment. So as we look at turbulent markets where there is competitive new supply, we very much like the safety feature that we can slow down or even stop if we're not getting the returns we expect. And of course we can increase elsewhere if we're getting the returns there and have that opportunity.","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate the comments there. And then just kind of focusing on the Bay Parc Plaza deal you started this quarter; Miami has been a weaker market than some of the others and you've referenced it is facing some heavier supply this year. So I guess what gave you the confidence to move forward with the first phase of that project? And then also how are you thinking about the timing on the second phase which I believe is more focused on the units itself?","Terry Considine","I assume it's just a same song different verse, we looked at the particular property in the particular context and the particular ideas to upgrade that property. Again, we have a talented team addressing it. And they've outlined various improvements in the first phase to the common areas in the second phase to inside the units and we will closely track the spending, closely track the market acceptance in returns. If we achieve what we expect or better, we'll go full speed ahead. If for any reason we're disappointed, we'll make adjustments or even stop.","Unidentified Analyst","Does the capital spend assume any additional starts this year? And then just separately, remind us again what target returns are on redevelopment?","Terry Considine","Paul can help you with that numbers but we have a wide range for redevelopment spending in our forecast to reflect just the uncertainties we see looking forward.","Paul Beldin","Also specifically around our starts, we have an expectation that we'll start between three and five of the larger scale projects that would be listed on schedule, tenant are supplemental. And then as always our expected returns are typically around at least a 9% free cash flow internal rate of return.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks for taking the question.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. First one is on the tax credit income in the 2018 forecast. What is -- what would drive that number higher? Is it starting some new projects where you've got some additional historic tax credit benefits? I mean I'm just trying to understand exactly how much variability there could end up being in your 2018 tax credit number?","Terry Considine","Sure, Nick. Just to make sure that I'm responding to your question, you're asking about the potential variability and the historic tax credit benefit?","Nick Yulico","Yes, for 2018, you have the 2016. Well, just add that entire non-core earnings of '16 to '22. What's the sensitivity to that being higher potentially?","Terry Considine","Sure. Let me walk through the various elements. First, starting with the first line item in our non-core earning category, that's the amortization of our deferred tax credit income. As you know that that's just the burn-off of our legacy, a low income housing tax credit business where we haven't had a new syndication in that business for a number of years. So this is really just the bleed off of projects that we've largely completed and under gas that we're required to amortize roughly over the delivery period of the associated credit to the investors. And so you see that decline from $18 million in '16 to about $6 million in 2018. The next line item is our non-recurring investment management revenues. As we've talked about at length, that's a piece of our business that is declined and really is all but done, at this point we don't have any expectation for any of those types of transactions in either '17 or '18.","Next our historic tax credit benefits; where in 2016 we benefited by about $14 million of those benefit and that was generated through the redevelopment activity by Paddy her teams primarily at Sterling and at Park Towne Place. And so what we expect in 2017 is to earn historic tax credits as we complete the third tower at Park Towne Place that John mentioned earlier today. And in the variability in 2018 is driven by the decision to start the fourth tower at Park Towne Place. So we do start that later this year, we would start to recognize tax credit benefit, historic tax credit benefits for that project in 2018. And so then the final piece of variability in that line item is really driven by whatever the potential new starts might be in future, and to the extent that those have the opportunity to earn historic tax credits, we'll certainly take advantage of that.","Nick Yulico","Okay, so that's helpful. Just to be clear so that the range on the historic tax credit benefits; does the range reflect the possibility of starting the new projects or no? In a new project where you could get more tax credit income?","Terry Considine","The range for 2018 only reflects the opportunity associated with the four tower at Park Towne Place.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then Terry, I guess just a bigger picture question; on dispositions you have been selling generally some older assets. What is the thinking on perhaps selling -- taking maybe a stake in some of your redevelopment you've done; the Venice project or others which you could sell at a much lower tax rate than where you've been selling assets which could perhaps help a little bit in the earnings accretion of your redevelopment program which seems like the redevelopment program right now is more of a NAV focused value creation?","Terry Considine","Nick, thank you very much for the question. You're correct we're mostly focused on net asset value creation per share. We call the combination of that with cash dividends, economic income, that's our basic long-term or total return measure and we're less focused on trying to generate earnings in a particular period. We look at our cost of capital but we also look at its impact on our portfolio quality, and we think in most cases it might -- it would be short-term advantageous but long-term disadvantageous to raise capital at a low cost but by at the sacrifice or dilution of our holdings of our highest quality assets. There are times in prices where we've done so, you'll recall that at Palazo [ph] for example, we sold 47% interest to an institutional partner, a decade ago, and they've been a good partner and we've regarded that as a good transaction. So it's something that's inside our tool kit but it's one that we would approach cautiously because we're quite focused on the quality of our portfolio.","Nick Yulico","Okay, so it sounds like we should think about the redevelopments that you've done, where you saved $300 million of value creation that -- that's just going to stay -- those projects could stay entirely on the balance sheet and you're not going to look to harvest some of that value creation to recycle capital or even return to shareholders, is that the way to think about it?","Terry Considine","I think so. I think what I would say in general is that looking forward we expect more of the same. The business environment will fluctuate but we feel we have a good plan and a good team to execute in '17 and '18 what we've done for the past many years and we'll focus on in terms of capital recycling, we're more likely to sell off the bottom. We find attractive cost of capital there, John mentioned in his remarks that our expected return on the assets we sold in 2016 was 6.6% and that provides a cost of capital that supports the 300 basis points spread to its investment, we think that's a good return, that's what we'll continue to focus on.","Nick Yulico","Thanks, Terry.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. Just a question on the methodology of your outlook, it seems like last time you were relying more on the recent [indiscernible] metrics forecast and this time around they are more of an internal forecast of where you think rents are going to be. But I'm just wondering which markets you saw a big differentiation between your forecasts and the third-party providers?","Paul Beldin","John, this is Paul. Our process for preparing the 2018 forecast was honestly substantially identical to what we did for 2017. And that is for our expectations of new leased rates we relied on third-party data providers, average of recent actual data at our submarket level. For renewal leases we assumed increases of 4.5%, that assumption is consistent with what we'll use in 2017. And then the only variable that we diverged is on our expense assumptions, and where last year in our model we assume that it would grow at the projection of inflation as provided by economy.com. We still did that for 2018 but then we took 15 basis points off that because the expectation was a growth rate of about 2.9%. And so looking back at our history, it's been a long, long time since we had a growth rate that high, and so we thought that might be overstating the potential for expense growth for 2018.","John Kim","And then as far as 2018, you're using recent metric as far as rental growth? And if so, just wondering which markets do you think will improve in '18 versus 2017?","Paul Beldin","John this was a high level analysis that we've been together in aggregate. So what we think is the important takeaway is that at least looking at the data provided by the third-party providers, they are expecting market rent growth of about 3% at our submarkets in 2018.","John Kim","Okay, got it. Just one follow-up; Philadelphia was one of your stronger markets last year and you're projecting it to be sort of a weaker market in '17; is that the market forecast or is that what you think you're actually going to achieve in your portfolio?","Keith Kimmel","John, this is Keith. It's a bit of just some caution knowing that there is a lot of new supply coming into Center City, and some of the impacts that we've seen coming through with that.","Terry Considine","Honestly, for '17 when we talk about our expectations for '17, that's our guidance. Those are expectations that are built upon both our bottom up sales of our budgets and our valuation as considered by a third-party data providers and whereas information that's provided for '18 is purely mathematical based upon third-party data providers.","John Kim","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon, guys. Paul, how front-end loaded is your disposition guidance for '17? Is it basically that plus the slowdown in same-store that's accounting for the $0.03 at the midpoint drop from fourth quarter FFO to first quarter?","Paul Beldin","Thank you for the question, Rob. Our expectations for dispositions next year is actually very much backend loaded. And so in in our earnings release we provided a walk of our 2016 FFO to 2017 FFO. And in that walk we showed $0.09 loss in FFO from the impact of property sales, and $0.08 of that $0.09 is due to dilution from our sales in 2016 and $0.01 is due to expected dilution of our 2017 sales. And so that the quarter-over-quarter midpoint projected decline from fourth quarter FFO to the first quarter midpoint is really being driven by its seasonality factors. If you think about it, it is the impact of coming off fourth quarter were typically we have lower turn cost because we have fairly lease expirations, lease expirations are lower in the first quarter as well but still higher than the fourth quarter generally. But more impactful is the impact of utility costs, both in the general sense and that our utility costs are lower in the fourth quarter than in the first but specifically in 2017, it's a bigger impact because we expect in 2017 a return to normalized weather and therefore normalized utility costs in Q1.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then what are you guys assuming for '17 for recurring but non-revenue producing CapEx per unit for the portfolio?","Paul Beldin","Recurring but non-revenue producing?","Rob Stevenson","Yes, the IFO [ph]?","Paul Beldin","Yes, we expect to spend about $1,100 per unit on our capital replacement spending which falls in that category.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then are there any material changes to the same-store portfolio as we had into '17? Any particular markets impacting?","Paul Beldin","Yes, just so everybody is on the same page. When we said our 2017 same-store expectations, it's based upon our portfolio at the end of the year. And so as we look out into 2017, we are adding to the same-store population, Lincoln Place, Ocean House, Preserve at Marin, the three stabilized redevelopments that John mentioned, as well as MESO [ph] which was an acquisition we made in 2015 in Atlanta. We also expect to remove say three to four to five properties due to the redevelopment and then one potential property -- one potential conventional property due to sale. And so you know that if you look at those eight properties in aggregate, we expect about a 20 basis point impact to our same-store growth rate.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","Next, we have a question from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. So just looking at the '18 guidance, the same-store is sort of as you mentioned a mirror image of '17 but the difference in the guidance is -- if you said -- if you talked about this before, I apologize; but higher dispositions, and it makes me think that you're kind of showing your cards a little bit there in the sense that if it's a better time to sell then maybe cap rates are compressing, and it's a little bit of a better time in '18 versus '17. Are you kind of chomping at the bit to say '18 could actually be a better year than '17 but just not willing to say it yet?","Paul Beldin","Rich, this is Paul. I'll start by talking about the dollars involved on the dispositions and maybe I'll turn over to Terry to comment on potential of the environment. In the third quarter call we talked about the fact that we're increasing our 2016 disposition guidance to get a little bit of a head start on our needs for 2017 and John and the team were very successful in accomplishing that. So if you were to normalize our expected dispositions by pulling the year end -- a portion of the year end 2016 sales, put those back in '17 as we originally expected a year ago, you know, there would be no change from our expectations for sales in 2017 versus 2018.","Richard Anderson","Okay.","Terry Considine","Rich, what I would add to that -- this is Terry, is that if you think about our pair trade discipline, it has the effect of neutralizing our opinions about whether -- one time will be better or worse because that assumption will be embedded in our sales activity but also our investment activity. So we're not particularly trying to be market timers, we raise our capital by selling lower rated assets at an attractive cost, reinvesting them in higher quality assets at a higher return.","Richard Anderson","Okay, I'll start trying to be a psychologist. And then sort of a general question, don't know if you'll be all answer off the cuff but do you have any sense of what your portfolio depends, what amount of your portfolio depends on H1B or student visas or any kind of legal immigration -- is that something that you track and have some sort of knowledge on?","Terry Considine","I do in general but not always in particular, but immigration is a very important contributor in my opinion to the country, and certainly to the rental apartment business. And we have a number of properties where we have -- and welcome high quality customers who are immigrants.","Richard Anderson","Alright. And do you have any opinion about -- you know, whether that's a good thing to have that kind of dependency on it, you know, in this day and age?","Terry Considine","Well, I think broadly as I say it can be a good quality customer; people with high income, high education, good jobs and so forth. If you're discussing what are what are the potential impacts of the Trump administration, those are not yet known but it will be a fact that we'll deal with.","Richard Anderson","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Drew [ph] of Robert W. Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. A quick question on Paul on the refinancing activity in the first quarter. It looks like the secured debt that was raised [indiscernible] caught 180 basis points. In terms of your debt costs assumptions for 2017, will they just mirror a movement in the tenure since then or has anything happened with spreads?","Paul Beldin","Thanks Drew for the question. For the refinancing activity that we completed in the fourth quarter, those were deals that we rate locked in the October timeframe. So if I'm thinking back to rates at that time, we're probably at the 180 to 220 type of -- 200 type of point. As we think about our expectations for 2017, the indications we have seen is we've been talking with our partners in the secured debt world is that spreads have remained about the same, there is always a little bit of a range depending upon the location of the quality of the asset and the need for our partner to allocate capital to that particular market. And so I think broadly we would say that our spreads for 2017 are expected to be between about the 130 and 150 range.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful. And then an operations question, would you consider 96% to maybe be an occupancy high watermark or might there be benefits in pushing that a little bit further depending on how the year unfold; how are you thinking about that?","Keith Kimmel","Drew, it's Keith. I'll walk through that. There is definitely the opportunity to go both ways on that and so what we will do is we will manage it market by market and so if we're in a market that we're seeing some acceleration in news lease rates and it's getting stronger, we may be more comfortable that the occupancy could dip a little bit in trade for higher new rents. In markets that we're seeing deceleration or we're seeing some more pressures, we may make a decision that says listen, let's moderate a little bit on the renewal side, let's retain customers and that may ultimately in turn, turn into a higher radio. So we won't manage it globally as a macro decision but we'll manage it building by building and market by market.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thanks for taking the question. First question, I just wanted to tell, there are couple of comments you had on the '17 outlook and how that relates to '18? On the one hand you're dependent on third-party providers for '18 which I understand but it sounds like they were too optimistic for '17. And then you talked to the difficulty and understanding the phasing of '17, just given the volatility in the market. So as you thought about putting out an '18 outlook, it seems like a difficult time to do that based on the volatility that you're seeing in the marketplace and the volatility of the forecast from the third-party; so how should we interpret your views today as far as how the exit point of '17 looks into '18 if you had to take a fresh look for yourself regardless of the third-party data providers?","Terry Considine","Dennis, this is Terry. And our exit point at the end of '17 will be in our '17 guidance, that reflects our judgment, our opinion. '18 as you say at this point is based on third-party providers who at least right now have been seen as perhaps too optimistic. I've read your material with interest and I recognize your concern and caution about what lies ahead, and I don't think it's clear that you're wrong, you may well be right. But what I would ask you to consider is that we're not passive takers of what the market provides, we're not ants on a log drifting downstream, we're in active hands-on management team and we believe that we can absorb what variance there may be in the market and continue to produce the kind of returns we've discussed.","Dennis McGill","Okay, that's fair, I appreciative it. And then second thought around the NAV calculation. If you take that $52 and you think about observing the cash yield, I think the math would be somewhere around 4%, a little bit later if you include all CapEx. I understand that it's a different way of looking at it but then in a rising interest rate environment you think about that versus alternatives; how would you phrase us to think about that differently versus what seems like what would be a tight cash-on-cash yield spread?","Terry Considine","I think that what's implicit or what's explicit in the net asset value calculation is the price at which properties would trade in the broad real estate markets. And those prices can certainly change, some of the factors that will increase factors going forward might be rising incomes, some of the factors that might depress valuations going forward might be changes in the risk free rate; those are obviously factors that can go in both directions. And so we're not trying to say that net asset value is a guaranteed number which will never change, that's not at all the case, we're trying to connect the value of the private real estate markets. Is that a response?","Dennis McGill","Yes, I think that makes sense. I appreciate it. Thanks, Terry.","Operator","The next question comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. On Lincoln Place, I know that's going to enter the same-store for this year and it's going to be a big contributor in Los Angeles. How has rent growth been trending there? I mean how do you foresee it contributing in '17?","Paul Beldin","Conor, this is Paul. Just to analyze a bit more color on the impact of Lincoln Place coming into the same-store pool. And as we look at our prospects for Lincoln Place in particular relative to the LA market as a whole, and translating that impact to the entire portfolio. We're not getting either a lift nor a detriment from the addition of Lincoln Place to the same-store pool.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you. And then John, have you seen any change in the transaction market in recent months? And how did the sale of the four assets in the fourth quarter go? Were they re-traded at all or was there any pullback from the buyers or the buyer pool?","John Bezzant","No, I think all four of those deals, the four properties that close are really two transactions; three of them were joining opportunity to land, there we operated as a single property and went to a single buyer. Those transactions were cut kind of mid-year and we did not see re-trade activity of any significant sort on either one of them; the fourth asset there was one at suburban Philadelphia. And in terms of the market overall, I would say that you know [indiscernible] last week, I think there are some caution there, I think the bid pools and then our discussions with brokers out there last week, bid pools are a little thinner, I think they are particularly thinner at the A price point. There is still a lot of interest in the capital out there chasing deals but a lot of that capital is focused on value-add and the B-C price point today.","Conor Wagner","So then based on that John, do you think you would have an opportunity to execute a paired trade at a tighter spread given that you're trying to sell that value add and buy more of the A property?","John Bezzant","Well, I would qualify one, the assumption that you make that we would want to buy more A property, let's start there.","Conor Wagner","Higher rate property, perhaps.","John Bezzant","Okay. So an essential element in the fair trade is certainly a higher rent. And as we have been very successful over the last several years in selling out of the bottom of our portfolio, our bottom 10% rents have moved up, and so it's tough to find a property in our portfolio today that's got rents under $1,100 a month. So the trade up math there and our free cash flow analysis and that's really the primary metric in that fair trade analysis is the free cash flow generated on both sides of the trade, the sell and the buy. That math gets tighter or that math gets harder, the tighter that spread is. So I would close the loop maybe by saying that we are not particularly interested in buying top of the market in terms of top price points today, we are very cautious as we look at trade opportunities, and I think that's manifest in the fact that other than closing Indigo that we tied up a year and a half ago, we haven't we haven't done a new acquisition deal in 18 months or more. And so we're cautious and I think that that is somewhat reflected in the general market as a whole.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","And the next comes from Buck [ph] of Raymond James.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, sorry I was on mute there. My question was actually pretty similar to the one just before that but maybe just rephrasing it; so you're about 50% A and 50% B and C now, looking ahead two years is that pretty much the mix you envision the portfolio being going forward or would you think you'd want to skew it still migrating closer to the A price points overtime?","Terry Considine","I think as we look at it today we're pretty comfortable in that 50-50 mix. If anything we see a little more opportunity right now on the B side for revenue growth in the coming year as we've laid out in our guidance. You know, there may be a little drift down from the A price point but I think our focus is really going to be on B\/C product as we look at potential acquisitions; and you'll see some drift that will come from redevelopments as they are [indiscernible] and other things that will push our average rate [ph], you're going to see that continued move.","Unidentified Analyst","And as you're looking at concession activity or just competitive behavior from lease-up properties right now where are you seeing maybe just the most acute pressure from concessions and what's the potential or where do you think there is the most potential that it could evolve into something that's maybe a little bit more irrational behavior from developers?","Terry Considine","I'll start maybe then maybe Keith or somebody else would like to jump in. That those big four lease-ups, the easy ones -- let's go to Indigo which is in downtown Redwood City with a limited amount of new supply around it, there is some that South San Mateo [ph] market is getting new supply but it's not downtown San Francisco. And so we are not seeing the concession activity, in fact yesterday we were on one of our lease-up and revenue calls related to Indigo, its primary competitor property is putting out renewal notices at $500 to $800 increases to the residents. And so we feel pretty comfortable about our rate and our lease-up pace there.","At One Canal we continue so see good pace there, you know it's winter and so pace is certainly slowed from the summer last year but they were over 90% leased and we're right on-track with our underwriting and feel very good about One Canal. Yes, there is some new supply; there is a new Avalon [ph] Tower just a few blocks away that's in lease-up but we have not seen major pushes there in terms of additional concessions or anything else and what can think they are tighter today than they were before.","And the Philadelphia properties, we're going to watch Park Towne and be cautious about it and go from there as we look at that fourth tower but we've got a third tower coming on in the first two of upgrade.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you all for your interest in Aimco. If we've left you with a question or do feel comfortable contacting me or Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer; or Lynn Stanfield, our Head of Investor Relations and FP&A or her trusted right hand, Elizabeth Colson. We'd be glad to answer them as best we can and for those of you that will be headed to Florida, in about six weeks we look forward to seeing you there.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day everyone. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment, including projections related to 2014 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, EVP in charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO.","A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa. And good morning to all of you. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Aimco had a solid first quarter to the start the year. As a result and as Ernie will discuss in a moment, we are increasing our full year guidance.","Before my colleagues report on first quarter particulars, I\u2019d like to point out a few highlights.","AFFO per share, adjusted funds from operations per share which is where Aimco measures current period profitability was up 13% year-over-year. FFO was up 4%. In property operations, Keith and his team showed excellent cost control, notwithstanding the winter cold and beat the high-end of same-store NOI guidance by 85 basis points.","In portfolio management, first quarter revenue per unit was more than $1,500, an increase of 10% year-over-year. John and his team continued to sell our lowest rated properties and reinvested the proceeds and properties with higher rents and better prospects. And of course when we make investments, we follow a paired trade discipline explicitly comparing what we expect to buy to what we plan to sell, we invest only when the projected free cash flow internal rate of return is greater than that of the property being sold and the portfolio quality is enhanced.","In redevelopment the news was mixed. On the one hand we completed Pacific Bay Vistas and our in joint rent increases across our redevelopment portfolio as John will report on in a few minutes, both generally due strong customer demand and in some cases due to scope changes to enhance the redevelopment. On the other hand, we now expect our cost to be substantially higher at two of our redevelopment projects. I\u2019d like to take a minute to tell you how we got our cost so wrong.","In redeveloping old vacant properties, we cannot know all physical conditions and all that needs to be remedied until we uncover the last foundation and open the last wall. At Lincoln Place there are 45 buildings, we based our initial cost estimates on thorough review of the first three buildings. By last fall we work away through another 10 buildings and what we learned with the basis for the increase and expected cost that we reported on our third quarter call.","As it turned out the last 32 buildings, have had even structural challenges and so require even more work. In the case of reserve the details are different, but the problem underestimated work to be done discovered as work unfolded is the same. We now know better what needs to be done at both properties and we have given you our best estimates of what it will cost.","In addition at Preserve we increase our scope of our work and upgraded our finishes, as John will report later that was a good decision for which we are getting paid. So let me summarize the entire Aimco team accepts responsibility for Aimco results.","We regretted our earlier estimates proved inaccurate, we dislike disappointing our shareholders. We\u2019re all engaged in reworking our processes to avoid such mistakes in the future. But, redevelopment will always have uncertainties, we will make mistakes in the future but we\u2019ll also get things right.","We still expect this crop of redevelopments to be profit, we now expect to spend about $670 million and for the improved properties to the worth about $930 million, a near 40% gain in our investment, before consideration of financial leverage.","This will add $1.50 per share to net asset value based on today\u2019s rents. Rents continue to rise in both markets, and if they do further value creation will follow.","Now let me turn to our balance sheet, Ernie, and Patti Fielding on his team, were pleased with Standard & Poor\u2019s upgraded Aimco and provided a clear and achievable path to an investment grade rating.","In the ordinary course, we would expect to meet the needs of required financial metrics over the next couple of years. Aimco seeking an investment grade rating as third party validation of our conservative balance sheet. It is expected to help the pricing of any preferred stock issuance. I hope that will also help the pricing of our common shares.","But to be clear, we continue to believe in the safety of our nonrecourse long dated fixed rate balance sheet strategy and we do not expect to issue corporate debt when we obtained an investment grade rating.","Finally our business is simple, we have a clear plan, a high quality of earnings with limited nonrecurring income and a high level of transparency. Our manage the team is cohesive, collaborative and having fund. We are gratified last month when the Denver Post again recognized Aimco as one of the top places to work in our state. It\u2019s my great pleasure to work with a high achieving team not only here in Colorado, but across the entire country.","And now for a more detail in the first quarter, I would like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. We are off to a good start in 2014. With first quarter revenue is up and healthy 4.6% year-over-year and 1.5% sequentially. Our on-site team is executed our plan with enthusiasm and continued commitment to excellent customer service. We continue to be rewarded with low turnover and renewal rent increases averaging 4.9% for the quarter.","With particular strength in the Bay area, Miami and Denver where renewal rates were up between 6% and 7%, of those leases that expired and were not renewed. New leases were signed at rates they were on average 1% higher than the expiring leases. Miami, the Bay Area, Denver led the way with new lease rate increases between 6% and 13%. As a result, of our team\u2019s hard work, we achieved blended lease rate increases of 2.8% for the quarter and we increased occupancy both year-over-year and compared to last quarter.","Turnover for the quarter was 46.9%. Of the customers who decided to move out, 24% were for career moves, 17% did not renew due to price and 15% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages.","We continue to be successful at replacing move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was 119,000. The median income was 71,000, resulting in a rent-to-income ratio of 21%. Year-over-year, the median income of our new resident is up 13% as we improved our portfolio and residents quality.","Now looking at our 10 largest markets which make up two-thirds of our revenue. The top four performers had revenue increases from about 7% to over 8% for the quarter led by the Bay Area, Miami, Denver and Chicago. Our steady performers for the quarter, with midrange growth of nearly 4% to over 5%, were Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Philadelphia.","Rounding out our 10 largest markets, we had Boston and Washington, D.C. both with positive growth year-over-year. While the polar Vortex in the Northeast and Midwest presented us some additional operating costs of about $1 million, we were able to offset that with higher revenues and balanced expense control in other areas.","Coming in ahead of our plan for net operating income. As we look ahead, we\u2019re building upon our first quarter successes with the solid April. April blended lease rates were up 4%, with new lease rates up 2.6% and renewals up 5.3%. April\u2019s average daily occupancy was 96.1%, on plan and a solid progression from the first quarter. May and June renewal offers went out with 5% to over 7% increases.","And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco\u2019s success. Turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you Keith. Today, I will focus my remarks on our redevelopment activities. During the first quarter Aimco invested $48 million in six redevelopment projects and $9 million in our One Canal Street development in Boston. We also invested $3 million in projects currently in our redevelopment pipeline.","As Terry mentioned in his remarks, we now expect higher costs and the delay in completion at two of our large redevelopment properties, Lincoln Place and Preserve at Marin. These two projects both for which were vacant for an extended period prior to redevelopment have presented unique challenges.","At Lincoln Place, we have now completed destructive testing and assessment in each of the 45 historic buildings on the site. Based on our findings, we have increased our estimated total investment in this project to $390 million. The majority of the additional cost is to remedy greater than expected code and structural deficiencies discovered as we proceeded with construction.","As of April 30th, we have completed construction on 19 buildings, comprising 294 apartment homes and 91% of those homes are occupied. At Preserve at Marin, our total investment is now expected to be a $125.5 million. Roughly 30% of this increased cost is a result of our decision during construction to enhance unit layouts and finishes to maximize potential rent. The remainder is due to additional structural and mechanical issues encountered in the building as proceeded with construction.","The resulting product at Preserve has been very well received. We\u2019ve completed nearly 15% of the apartment homes to-date, all of which are leased. And on average, these apartment homes were leased within 11 days of becoming available at rents well above our original underwriting.","In San Bruno, we have completed as planned, the construction of our third large redevelopment property, Pacific Bay Vistas. Our lease-up on this property is proceeding on plan. Physical occupancy on April 30 was 62% and we expect to be fully leased by the end of the summer.","You\u2019ll note on supplemental schedule 10 this quarter couple of revisions to our presentation. These include, segregated reporting of the previously vacant new development properties from our redevelopments and operating properties and some additional detail on other rental income and commercial revenues where applicable. We have also updated revenue estimates on all of our projects to reflect market rent growth and our leasing performance since original underwriting.","Overall, forecasted average revenues per apartment home have increased 12.4% from previously disclosed expected rents. And we will update these estimates at least annually on a go forward basis.","Finally along with updates to our cost estimates, we are also providing information around historic tax and other credits, expected to be earned in connection with our redevelopment projects, which reduce Aimco\u2019s total investment and enhance our returns.","Based on the updated net investment estimates and revenue expectations, our redevelopments in process, and those completed in the last 12 months are expected to generate average NOI yield at today\u2019s rents of 5.5%. Cap rates in the sub-markets [those] communities are located currently average about 4%, resulting in $260 million of value creation or roughly $1.50 per share.","With that I will turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernie Freedman","Thanks John. Pro forma FFO of $0.50 per share was at the high end of our guidance range, with outperformance and property operations of $0.02 and higher non-recurring income of $0.01, offset by higher than anticipated casualty losses due to the unseasonably cold winter in the Northeast and Midwest of $0.02.","Property damage was caused mostly by ice stemming, burst water pipes and water intrusion. First quarter losses of $4 million were $2.5 million greater than anticipated and $3 million higher than first quarter last year.","Turning to redevelopment, we disclosed in our earnings release that the expected yield using current rents for our current redevelopments is approximately 5.5%. You may recall that we have previously disclosed in our third quarter earnings call that the yield using current rents for our redev pipeline was about 7%.","Let me take a few moments to reconcile these two results and refer different populations of redevelopment properties. The current 5.5% yield is for the current redevelopments that is the redevelopment communities noted in our supplemental schedule 10 plus Elm Creek which was completed late last year.","This population was included in our redev pipeline two quarters ago with an expected yield of 6%. That expected yield again on current rents dropped from 6% to 5.5% due to the cost overruns that Terry and John discussed, offset some by rent increases. The redev pipeline to which we referred in calculating the 7% yield includes our current redevelopments plus other properties.","The redev pipeline included all the projects that we had announced as our class of 2012. It included projects that were started and\/or completed as of the third quarter 2013 as well as those that we anticipated starting in the next 12 to 18 months. Due to those projects and are stabilized and in our same store pool, so I removed them from our current redevelopments, all three achieved yields in excess of 7%.","Two other projects are 2900 on First in Seattle, in Sterling and Philadelphia. The third quarter 2013 redev pipeline assumed the full redevelopment of those communities but our current redevelopments assumes only the spending that we have disclosed in supplemental schedule 10. For both properties full redevelopment could involve more than two times the investment that we have announced today.","Finally, the largest reconciling item between the different populations involves Park Towne Place in Philadelphia. I anticipate that we will announce its phased redevelopment similar to Sterling later this year. Also similar to Sterling though the third quarter 2013 redev pipeline assumed the full redevelopment of Park Towne Place. Because we have not yet started its redevelopment, no contribution from Park Towne Place is included in the current redevelopments listed in supplemental schedule 10.","So our current redevelopment is sub set of our previously reported redev pipeline, and does not include spending for completed redevelopments, nor the full spending on phased redevelopments, nor the spending for the unannounced redevelopment of Park Towne. So the apples-to-apples comparison is that our yield expectations for our current redevelopments have fallen due to the additional costs we disclosed, bringing down the expected yield for this subset of our redev pipeline from 6% to the 5.5% number. These current redevelopments though are largely located in coastal California with the slow market cap rate, so we continue to create meaningful net asset value at our 5.5% current yield.","Regarding the balance sheet, in April S&P upgraded Aimco to BB+ positive, they also provided a roadmap on what it would take to achieve an investment grade rating. Items they included were leverage at the low-end of 7 to 7.5 times for debt to EBITDA; debt to undepreciated assets under 50% and fixed charge coverage on a path to achieve and sustain at two times.","These are relatively consistent with the feedback we received from Fitch last year with the important exception that Fitch required an unencumbered pool of about 7% of our GAV. We are making progress in all these areas and in the normal course of our activity should reach these targets in the next two years.","Looking ahead for the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.48 to $0.52 per share and AFFO is projected to be $0.36 to $0.42 per share. Year-over-year conventional same-store NOI growth is projected to be 3.5% to 4.5%. Second quarter conventional same-store NOI is projected to be up 0.25% to 1.25% compared to first quarter. We have increased, both full year pro forma FFO and AFFO guidance to take into account first quarter\u2019s outperformance.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Laura, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Nick Joseph of Citigroup.","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Thanks. So, just starting on the redevelopment and looking at supplemental 10, you break out the previously vacant communities and new development and other redevelopment. Does that 5.5% expected yield on current rents that you\u2019re quoting right now refer to all of those assets, or just the previously vacant and the new development?","Ernie Freedman","Hey, Nick, this is Ernie, let me clarify that. For the items that are list on schedule 10 to 5.5% includes all those assets except for One Canal, as One Canal is a development property. So the yields on One Canal aren\u2019t much different than the 5.5% and we disclosed that previously. But it\u2019s meant to capture the three projects you see in the previously vacant communities, Lincoln Place, Pacific Bay Vistas and Preserve at Marin, as well as the contributions from Palazzo, Sterling and 2900 on First.","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","","So just looking at the previously vacant communities, what was your original underwritten expectation for those, and what is the expected yield now for those, just for those three?"," ","Ernie Freedman","For those three, we typically have not given out specific numbers Nick for specific projects. But, I\u2019ll call them the big three. And we\u2019re back in third quarter of 2013, they were 50 bps higher for those three. They were touch lower than 6% and those two are coming in a touch lower than 5.5% and the rest of the projects get them back up to 5.5%.","Original underwriting varied on all those, Preserve at Marin had the lowest expectations, making place at slightly higher. We had issued a press release back when we announced Lincoln Place, where we expected the yields to be closer to 6%. ","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","","And then you mentioned the previous increase to estimated costs. What gives you the confidence that these new estimates that you have will be accurate?","John Bezzant","","Nick, this is John. When we did a six months ago, at Lincoln for example and Terry kind of walk through the map there. But we were relatively early in the process for these buildings. We now have had the opportunity (inaudible) 45 of them Lincoln is unique and it is designated historic buildings and the existing structures. And so our ability to go in and do mass demolition if you will improve our cost early on was very limited.","And so as we worked our way through the project we now have all 45 open we have more experience working with the contractor that has given us the opportunity to kind of see where costs come in and how we fix the deficiencies that we find as we get into the buildings. And we feel very comfortable with where our projections are today. And at Preserve it\u2019s kind of same works not historic buildings, but they are roughly 40 years old and as we got into those we just found more as we went along in addition to the scope that we have. ","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","","And just one final question, big picture, given the cost increases now twice, what does that do to make you rethink maybe the possibility of large-scale redevelopment and development in the role with AIV?","Terry Considine","Nick its Terry. And what I would say is that we would point to the success we\u2019ve had in other large scale development activities the most difficult of which was actually the $75 million or $80 million CRCI project at Park Towne over the last year and half which came in ahead of schedule and under budget. So that first things is that these are not all of our experience they\u2019re part of our experience.","The second thing is that we will do make every effort to improve our process and one example of that you can see at Sterling or as Ernie mentioned at 2900 First and that Park Towne, which is we\u2019ll take big projects and break them into smaller projects. So that we\u2019ll be better able to communicate what the costs are in the near-term for a smaller amount of it, sterling, we are doing three floors out of 30 that\u2019s, what\u2019s been announced there is a phase we will be able to report on that and upgrade our cost or adjust them as we learn going forward.","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","","Great thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico - UBS","Thanks. Going back to the redevelopment, I want to go through a couple of the accounting issues here. In the fourth quarter, you said that 2014 you would get a $0.07 FFO benefit per share from the big three delivering this year. I think that was going to then grow to $0.14 of annual benefit next year. What are the updated numbers for this year and next year?","Terry Considine","Well, specifically Nick for the big three, those numbers won\u2019t change very much, we will see a little bit more capitalize interest in 2013 than we originally expected because deliveries have been slowed some, we actually had an outperformance in the first quarter with regards to absorbing units at the big 3 specifically at Pacific Bay Vistas and at Lincoln place.","And so for 2014 we\u2019re likely to see a penny or two benefit from that, what that means is the comparison the 2015 we won\u2019t be as strong, but we still expect to get to the same number. Now that\u2019s from the NOI contribution from the big 3 and that we do have to fund the additional $65 million of costs associated with these projects, which will come from property sales.","And those sales could happen any time as we get later in the 2014 or into 2015, that timing has not been completely determined. I would expect though on a run rate basis to lose about $0.03 to $0.04 of NOI contribution from those assets, so I have to sell in order to fund the remaining cost that we\u2019re going to be required on those assets.","So that redev contribution will stay very consistent, but we\u2019ll potentially have a dilutive impact from having to fund that extra work through additional property sales over the next 18 months.","Nick Yulico - UBS","And just going back to when you\u2019re saying the redev contribution would be similar now this year to what you previously said, you\u2019re saying that also factors in the capitalized interest staying longer this year?","Terry Considine","No, that will help our numbers this year which will make the comparison for next year little bit more challenging because it will have won\u2019t have stable comparison.","Nick Yulico - UBS","Okay, and then going to the -- when you talk about this, the 5.5% yield you expect on the redevelopment pipeline, does that include the tax credit income that you\u2019re booking this year from Lincoln Place?","Terry Considine","Now what we do at that is and we talk about supplemental schedule too Nick is that that reduces the cost basis to the projects. So we count that as a deduct to the overall cost of the projects, so the cost of the projects that we talked about from this class as well as Elm Creek is about $670 million on a net basis, $695 million on overall total basis. And so it does brings down the denominator and the calculation yield we were not impacting our income numbers for that when we are calculating the 5.5.","Nick Yulico - UBS","Okay. So the 5.5%, from a modeling standpoint, you\u2019re saying that 5.5% yield times the $670 million cost is the NOI contribution?","Terry Considine","NOI contribution in today\u2019s rents and of course that will change based on how rents grow over the next few quarters.","Nick Yulico - UBS","Right. Okay. But then from an accounting basis, you\u2019re also booking the $10 million to $11 million of tax credit income this year? ","Terry Considine","Well it\u2019s really apples to oranges Nick and the fact that you are talking about how something get impacted in FFO. So we have given the math and calculate what the NOI contribution is going to be for these ones to stabilize, we\u2019ve also disclosed separately how things will run through FFO. So I would disagree with your characterization double count there.","Nick Yulico - UBS","No. I wasn\u2019t saying there\u2019s a double count; I\u2019m trying to make sure that everyone -- that our modeling is correctly in that, the NOI contribution you\u2019re saying is based on this net investment that you\u2019ve had. Or you\u2019re booking tax credit income this year for the piece that you\u2019re saying reduces your net investment. So I\u2019m just trying to understand the overall NOI, should it be actually based on that $670 million?","Terry Considine","Nick it sounds like we should prior to take offline so tap the call too much, but absolutely the answer is that to get to the NOI number if you take the yield multiplied by the investments and that\u2019s we\u2019re going to see overtime, certainly I don\u2019t want you to bake that into your model in 2014 or 2015 because there is stabilization period. But that\u2019s how you deal with the redev contribution separate from that is the income recognition how running, the impact from tax credits over the next many years, but I\u2019d be happy to take that offline with you to help to make sure we have here model correctly.","Nick Yulico - UBS","Okay, thanks.","Operator","The next we have a question from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thank you, thank you. Terry, question for you. You\u2019ve made significant strides in your business the last few years here on the operations portfolio, balance sheet. And despite your pretty strong first-quarter operating performance, the question so far has focused pretty exclusively on your redev activities. How concerned are you that the latest issues here might overshadow your recent progress on other parts of your business? And how are you thinking about future redev beyond the current pipeline that you\u2019ve identified? Are you just as committed to redev as an external growth leveler? Will you adjust your underwriting, perhaps require higher returns? What are you thinking?","Terry Considine","Haendel, first of all thank you very much for your kind words about the significant strives that have been made. The entire Aimco team has worked very hard at being better at operations, better at cost control, upgrade the portfolio, improve the balance sheet so on and so forth. So, I guess, I look at redevelopment as just one more of these areas where the entire team will focus.","When we look at redevelopment, we see a number of successes and we see a couple of disappointments. And so, it\u2019s important to maintain context and not throughout the baby with the bath water. We are not excited about reporting cost increases.","I don\u2019t want to mislead you there, that is a big disappointment to me and to all of my colleagues. But we\u2019ll be focus in the future about being better at estimating cost and better at execution and hopefully more predictable, I mentioned a couple of examples of that in response to an earlier question. And my hope is that we will have more predictable execution in the future.","That said, it is inherently unpredictable business. And it\u2019s one that has been highly profitable for us even in these particular properties, which are the subject of concern. Just to think about it, if we\u2019re creating 40% value on our investment, that\u2019s a pretty good return. And so, we will continue to do it, we\u2019ll continue to try to do it better. ","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you for that. Ernie, one for you. Can you walk us through the cost increases for each project, Corte Madera and Lincoln Place, since you began work on them last year? And also, can you talk a bit about the rent growth that\u2019s occurred in those markets over the same timeframe?","Ernie Freedman","Sure, I\u2019ll let John address the changes in the cost estimates from the projects at Lincoln Place and Preserve at Marin and I can then address the changes in rents. ","John Bezzant","Hi, Haendel. I think Lincoln Place we\u2019ve got two pieces I mean we can go back to schedule Tim and I don\u2019t have initial schedules, Tim\u2019s here to tell you but I would tell you at the hard cost line not including capitalize costs, similar stuff. Our total cost increases at Lincoln from the original budget are about $50 million and at Preserve at Marin it\u2019s about 32. And then we\u2019ve got other soft cost and some other things are involved in there, but that\u2019s ballpark from where we started on the projects. Does that answer your question?","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Yes on the cost side, can anyone talk maybe keeping up where the market growth in those areas that are faced out there?","Ernie Freedman","Hey Haendel. This is Ernie I can address what\u2019s happened with the markets we\u2019ve been fortunate that the market in the Bay Area has been very strong since we started the project at Preserve at Marin. From our original underwriting expectation that market is virtually from original starting of the project that market is up almost 20%, 19.5%. Keith and his team have been able to achieve and we\u2019re confident we will be able to continue to achieve rents although more than 10% higher than we originally expected coming from the scope changes that John had put into place with the team back away. And so rents are almost up 30% between those two that\u2019s how you get from the 38, 80 number that we\u2019ve disclosed previously upto the 51, 50 numbers we\u2019re disclosing today.","At Lincoln Place, it\u2019s a similar story but not quite a strong. At Lincoln Place rents are up about 7% since we started the works on the market units the Phase 2 units and we have rent achievement that we\u2019re expecting to be right about where we expected and maybe slightly better about 101% or 102%. So roughly a 10% increase getting from 2,470 to today\u2019s rents closer to 2,700 that we\u2019ve disclosed in the current scheduled time.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up if I may. Can you walk us to the components to that $25 million credits you\u2019ll be able to offset against some of the cost increase at Lincoln Place, some of the components and then potentially are there any maybe further credits that you have not enrolled yet but are well somewhat likely?","Terry Considine","Sure. Specifically at Lincoln Place, (inaudible) we have two streams of credit so we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of. We have talked about the fact that Lincoln place that one of our requirements is to maintain the historic nature of that project that certainly has made it more costly for us as to maintain the historic nature of the project. But it also gave us the opportunity to get historic tax credits and use those historic tax credits. Today we expect those historic tax credits to be about $23 million to $24 million that were earned over the construction period of the project.","In addition we\u2019re able to negotiate with some local utilities some utility reimbursement credit in the amount of a couple of million dollars so net-net we expect that $25 million of credit at Lincoln place. I don\u2019t expect that will achieve further credits at Lincoln place, but what I can tell you this is something that we look at our other projects as well.","Two projects in particular that have the ability to potentially achieve historic tax credit for us or sterling, as well as Park Town Place. And as you know Park Town Place we have not disclosed or announced the beginning of the that project, but we have the first phase of sterling, the numbers that we currently have in our earnings release and supplemental schedule Tampa sterling do not take into account any of the historic tax credits we make it there. That is still a moving target. Those credits have not been earned as if yet like they\u2019ve been at Lincoln place, where we have better inside in that more specific number that we potentially get on sterling we\u2019ll highlight that in supplemental schedule ten and adjust our expect to cost bases downward on sterling for when we earn those credits.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Terry Considine","","Thanks Haendel.","Operator","And our next question will come from Dave Bragg of Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Hi good afternoon.","Terry Considine","","Hey Dave.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Hi. So first question relates to one more just on the redevelopment looks like for the four projects, the big projects are on, you are assuming roughly a 75% margin to get to that 5.5% yield is, is that close?","Terry Considine","That would be pretty close, they vary a little bit above and little below, that\u2019s correct based on the rents and their locations.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. And as it relates to operating expenses, the recurring maintenance reduction really stood out in the first quarter. I just want to make sure there is no change in accounting policy between that in your capital replacement cost per unit which went up 20% year-over-year?","Terry Considine","No changes all there, that\u2019s just the nature of the timing when those repairs of maintenance happen to happen. We would expect that that number will trend back to budget throughout rest of the year that is just the timing of activity that happen, so changes in accounting policies.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay, great. And then in the second quarter of 2013 in same store pool you achieve that renewal growth of 5.2 and you move into 3.1, how should we expect second quarter \u201814 to stay relative to that?","Terry Considine","Okay. Well, Keith, why don\u2019t you go -- we talked about the numbers for April, so we really talked about how April came out and why don\u2019t you talk about what\u2019s happening renewals at least for May and June?","Keith Kimmel","Sure. Dave, April let me just walk through the progression of what we saw on new leases at 26 renewals and 53 in the blended 40. And what I would tell you our May and June went out at 5% to better than 7% on the renewal side. We typically see somewhere between 15 and 100 basis point melt from the [ask] to the ultimate take and so that\u2019s what I give you some inside on how it is looking.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Last question for Terry and one for Ernie is regarding the ATM would that in place just talk about your thought process in what situation what might we see you utilize it?","Terry Considine","Well, David we might use it to issue preferred stock but we are unlikely to use it to issue common stock to take those in order. For preferred stock, we remain interested in long duration fixed rate liabilities and preferred the pricing of preferred stocks is getting more attractive to us and we\u2019re following that. So it\u2019s consumable that we would issue preferred stock in a way that would accelerate that unencumbered pool that would prefund future maturities so on and so forth. For common stock, it\u2019s not attractive at this time, because the share price continues to be at a discount, even though the stock has had a good run, our net asset value continues to increase and so we look at that before we had issue common stock.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Terry Considine","","Thanks Dave.","Operator","And next we have a question from Michael Salinsky of RBC.","Michael Salinsky - RBC","Good afternoon, guys. Just going back to one last thing on the redevelopment. The $25 million of tax credits. Is that the plan to sell those and net that against the cost to or those be amortize than earnings going forward?","Terry Considine","","I don\u2019t know, last three people I have promised this would be the last question on redevelopment. Promise (inaudible) else going forward too.","Michael Salinsky - RBC","My next two questions will not be related to redevelopment I promise that.","Terry Considine","","Mike, nice thing about the tax, because we have a choice to either\/or. Right now our base model is to assume that we\u2019re going to ease the tax credits, because we have taxable income from other activities that would be able to be in the tax credits we have used against. So we have that available for us to use those tax credits. That said it is a better economic decision starting tomorrow six months, nine months or 12 months from now is to bringing the partner, who can then use those tax credits and effect they buy to the partnership and that allows for them to get the tax credits and that provides better economics for us, we would absolutely do that and of course we have done that in the past some other projects.","Right now, the base cases assume that we will use the tax credits, but we have a person who monitors that market very closely for us and if there is an opportunity to get even more value for the credits so we would certainly love to do that too.","Michael Salinsky - RBC","Okay. The transactional income you recognized in the first quarter, I believe your guidance before was zero to $2 million and it was about $2 million in the quarter. Was that just moved forward from the fourth quarter to the first quarter or was that incrementally more? And if you look at the guidance now, what is assumed in terms of transactional income in the updated guidance?","Terry Considine","You asked this question that was actually transactional income that we were not anticipating. So whether or not a timing issuance of the reasons why I was comfortable bumping up guidance for the entire year for FFO and AFFO, because of that activity Mike. That said, when it comes to the next quarter and we do an updated guidance across the entire board, that\u2019s one area where you will likely see a slight guidance increase because that was unanticipated transaction income in the first quarter.","Michael Salinsky - RBC","Okay. Then final question, in terms of dispositions, previously, when we last talked on the fourth quarter, you said second quarter was going to be where the bulk of dispositions occurring. How much is being marketed right now? Is it still 2Q heavy, or has some of that been pushed back to the back half of the year just can you give us an update where we stand on dispositions for the year?","John Bezzant","Sure, mike. This is John. Yes, we have, there will be more activity in the second quarter than what you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter, borrowing some black swan event that keep things from closing, but we\u2019re on track for a heavier second quarter than the first.","And then as Ernie referenced earlier with the additional redev spend here we\u2019ve got the opportunity or we will be selling some more assets as we get into the later part of the year. So you will see some activity come together towards the end of the year in terms of total dollar volume and everything else remains to be seen, how big that goes, but there will be something more coming towards the end of the year as well.","Michael Salinsky - RBC","Okay. Thank you.","Terry Considine","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And next we have a question from Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning.","Terry Considine","Hey, Karin.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Sorry to break the promise. One more for you sorry. In the two projects that the overruns do they still meet the projected free cash flow internal rate of return hurdle that you mentioned at the beginning of the call?","Terry Considine","Karin this is Terry. They do in this sense that with these numbers the risk adjustment would be out of the expectation. In other words if we were starting something new we would want to have a high margin over the cost of buying a stabilized property to just allow for the kind of uncertainties we found, at this point having found them that risk adjustment would come down. And so if the expected NOI yield is 6.5% and the expected market gap is 4% the net value creation would be quite effective to us.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay thanks for that. A question for Keith, it looks like rent increases were just a little bit below in 1Q \u201814 which is a little bit below where they were in 1Q \u201813 but you had some pretty nice momentum here post quarter. Do you think rent growth could be as good this summer as it was in the summer of 2013?","Keith Kimmel","Hi Karin this is Keith. As you\u2019ve pointed out we\u2019ve seen a nice steady progression on rent growth. As we look at where April came in and where we\u2019re seeing May we think that that should look quite similar. And as far as the summer goes we believe it should be quite similar to what we saw last year.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Helpful. And then just last question was the dispositions you did this quarter I think we\u2019re at a 6, 7 cap rate that seems pretty attractive. Was there anything particular about those assets were they value-add under occupied or anything the cost of cap rate to be below 7 or is it just the nature of the pricing in the market today?","Ernie Freedman","Nature of pricing in the market, locationally they were two Florida assets, one West Palm area and one in the Jacksonville area and one hand Denver.","But that cap rate, I think reflective of metropolitan area BC pricing generally, I think as we look forward into the pipeline for the remainder of the year and if you look back to last year, I think our average last year was kind of mid 7s range I would expect to see you\u2019ll get, depending on the mix in any given quarter you will see the numbers bounce around a little bit but I think for the year on a whole it will in kind of the low 7s range.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Thank you very much.","Operator","","And with that we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you and thank you all for your interest in Aimco.

During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management\u2019s judgment including projections related to 2015 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted funds from operations and funds from operations. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco\u2019s website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President in-charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. The Aimco transformation continues and again 2015 was good news to report for each of our five areas of strategic focus; property operations, redevelopment, portfolio management, balance sheet and culture. Here is the bottom line. Our most important metric for economic success is the sum of cash dividends plus increases in net asset value per share.","As announced earlier this week our quarterly dividend is up 15% year-over-year. Consensus NAV per share is also up 24% year-over-year. Here is how we are making this progress, in property operations our highest priorities are to select high quality customers provide outstanding customer service, control costs and do all of these consistently.","Here are a few facts, first the quality of Aimco customers is better than ever. The median income of residence moving into an Aimco apartment during the first quarter was $80,000 up 13% compared to last year and up 36% compared to just three years ago. Higher household incomes reflect an older and more established customer with a median age of 35.","Second, Aimco\u2019s service quality is also at a record high. Over the last two years Aimco customers have provided a 170,000 answers to surveys with satisfaction scores rising steadily. In the first quarter Aimco customers graded us at 4.12 stars out of 5. And Keith and his team are working hard to fill in and earn that fifth star.","Third, by attracting and selecting the right customers and providing excellent customer service, we keep turnover low. Aimco customers rent and Aimco apartment for an average of 24 months up from 22 months just three years ago. This helps control cost, because turnover is expensive approximately $2,300 per turn. And over the last three years Aimco turnover has averaged 48% much lower than the pier average of 55%.","Lower turnover helps this controllable cost. Defined as property cost before taxes, insurance and utility expense. Here are out compound annual growth rate has been negative over the last six years. This is the result of hard work and numerous small initiatives.","Now in the first quarter controllable cost were higher than we would like due to seasonal cost for snowmageddon [ph] some timing issues and some areas where we expect improvement. Over the years Keith and his teams have done a great job in cost control and expect we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Let me turn to redevelopment, in the first quarter we completed construction at Lincoln Place and Preserve at Marin. Our cost and timing were within the forecast we revised one year ago and we are achieving rents above underwriting. As to completive redevelopments we expect second generation lease rates to increase substantially as explicit and implicit construction in discounts are recovered.","For example, Pacific bay business completed last year average rent increases in the first quarter were up 14% it going to 8% on renewals and 20% on new leases. Patti and her teams are doing an excellent job with the current profit redevelopments and with refilling our redevelopment pipeline for future years. They continue to expect net asset value creations equal to 30% and more of our redevelopment spending. ","Next, portfolio management is one of our most important responsibilities. It\u2019s how we allocate the shareholder capital and trusted to us. Our goal is to increase portfolio quality, while maintaining geographic and price point diversification. Our discipline is to make pair trades that is to sell Property A to fund Property B. The comparison makes it easy to see whether what we\u2019re doing is busyness or makes income better. Here is the record.","During the past three years and first quarter of this year John and his team sold almost $2 billion of properties with rents about $900 a month, and invested the proceeds in the acquisition, redevelopment and development of properties with average rents about $2,400 a month. This increased portfolio average rents by 35% to more than $1,700 in part due to market rent growth, but mostly due to the impact of redevelopment and acquisitions funded by dispositions. ","Our free cash flow margin increased by 10% through the sale of lower rent properties and reinvestment and higher rent properties. The percentage of our portfolio invested in \"A\" quality properties increased by almost a half and was funded by reducing by 80%, the percentage of our portfolio invested in \"C\" quality properties. ","The percentage of net operating income earned in our target markets increased to 90% and that improvement continues. Portfolio average rents in the first quarter were 13.2% higher year-over-year. We follow this pair trade discipline in all of our investments, large or small. We have a clear and consistent strategy. That is we focus on 12 to 15 target markets, we maintain price point diversification while upgrading the overall quality of our portfolio. We remain within our leverage targets and we invest in properties as risk adjusted, free cash flow, internal rates of return are greater than those of the properties sold to fund the investment. ","Now when we allocate capital, we have several options. Often or most attractive users are upgrades to properties we already own, whether to capital improvements or through redevelopment. Most of our capital spending falls into this category. We have a second opportunity within properties we already own to increase density that is build new apartment homes with middle or no additional land cost. Yelm Creek is a recent example. ","A third opportunity is to make property acquisitions. In a competitive market we generally find pricing unattractive except where we can add value through improved operations. Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, it would be an example from last year. ","Finally, on rare occasion we will undertake new development, where we are unable to access a target market by either accretive redevelopment or acquisition. Examples over the past years include The Palazzo\u2019s in Los Angeles and One Canal in Boston. In each of these, we selected an experienced developer who skin in the game insulated Aimco from development risk. In each of these, we expect higher returns to compensate for the residual risk. This is exactly the model we are following at the La Jolla Cove [ph] in California. We are not in the development business, we will not get into the development business, we do not have and will not build an internal development team.","Onto balance sheet, our highest priority is safety. We focus on low leverage, on limiting entity risk, refunding risk, re-pricing risk and construction funding risk. We are committed to low leverage. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage to value was about 35%. We expect that to decline as our re-developments lease up, bringing our leverage closer to 30%.","We are measured by leverage to EBITDA, our target is to be less than seven to one and to be lower still at this time in the cycle, say six and half to one or even six to one. Again we expect re-development lease ups, property operations and property debt amortization paid from retained earnings to be the basis for further improvement in this metric. When thinking about leverage, we consider un-funded construction obligations. For example, at our Lincoln Place Redevelopment we obtained a property loan commitment for $190 million to fund construction, before we went forward.","We\u2019ve come to appreciate the financial flexibility of a pool of unencumbered properties and at the end of the first quarters, ours had a value of $1.3 billion. It was gratifying and a well deserved compliment to Ernie and his team when during the first quarter the safety of the Aimco balance sheet was recognized by S&P as investment grade. The continuing and substantial progress on these several clearing and consistent priorities is grounded in our intentional emphasis on a collaborative, respectful and performance-oriented culture. We work as a team.","We are gratified last month, when the Denver Post again recognized Aimco is one of the top places to work in our state. For me it\u2019s a great pleasure and privilege to work with a high achieving team, not only here in Colorado, but across the entire country. This record of increasing net asset value per share, improving operations, profitable redevelopment, a high quality portfolio, a safe balance sheet and a positive culture together with a positive outlook for more of the same with a backdrop when the Aimco Board of Directors voted earlier this week to increase the quarterly dividend. In short for Aimco, business is quite good.","Now for more detail in the first quarter, I would like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Terry. We\u2019re up to a solid start in 2015, with first quarter revenues up 4.4% year-over-year and 1.7% sequentially. Our onsite teams executed our plan with enthusiasm and continued commitment to world-class customer service. As a result, we achieved renewal rate increases averaging 4.8% for the quarter with particular strength in the Bay Area, Miami and Boston. Were those leases expired and we\u2019re not renewed, our new leases accelerated throughout the quarter from 30 basis points in January to March as increase of 2.3%.","As a result of our team\u2019s hard work, our blended lease rates also improved throughout the quarter from 2.1% in January to 3.5% in March, all while increasing average daily occupancy for the quarter by 20 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially.","Turn over for the quarter was 48.4%. Of the customers who decided to move out, 23% were for career moves, 17% did not renew due to price, and 13% moved out to purchase homes. There are no significant changes in these move-out reasons versus recent quarters or our long-term averages. We continue to be successful in replacing move-out with better qualified residents at higher rents.","The average incomes of those new customers who moved in during the first quarter was $137,000. The median income was $80,000 resulting in a consistent rent-to-income ratio of 21%. Year-over-year the median income of our new residents is up 13% compared to the first quarter of 2014. This result is driven by an improvement in our portfolio and resident base.","Looking at our ten largest markets, which make up three quarters of our revenue. The top performers had revenue increases from 6% to nearly 10% for the quarter. This was led by the Bay Area followed by Denver, Miami, San Diego and Los Angeles.","Our steady performance for the quarter with midrange growth of over 3% to better than 5% were Boston, Chicago, Orange County and Philadelphia. And rounding out our ten largest markets, we had Washington D.C. which was up 80 basis points.","As we look ahead to preliminary April results, blended lease rates were up 4.7%, 90 basis points ahead of April 2014 with new leases up 4.3%, and renewals up 5.2%. April\u2019s average daily occupancy was 96.5%, 30 basis points ahead of last year, and May and June renewal offers went out was 6% to 8% increases. With great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco success.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. During the first quarter Aimco continued the improvement of its portfolio through the application in this pair trade discipline. With the sale of lower rated properties and investment of the proceeds and properties with higher rents and better prospects.","We sold conventional properties in Garden Grove, in Cyprus California, Towson Maryland and Suburban Denver. We also sold two affordable properties. These properties had average revenues per apartment home of less than $1,300 and sold with an average free cash flow cap rate of 4.7%.","Through redevelopment, development and acquisitions, one in the first quarter and second in April, we invested in properties located in Boston, Venice, California, the Bay Area, Center City, Philadelphia, and Buckhead Area of Atlanta. We expect from these investments stabilized average revenues per apartment home of nearly $2,800 more than twice that of the properties we sold. Stabilized free cash flow cap rates over 5%, and higher projected revenue growth.","An important contributed to Aimco\u2019s rapidly improving portfolio is our redevelopment program. During the first quarter, we invested $25 million in redevelopment, and as Terry mentioned, completed construction at Lincoln Place in Venice, California and Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera, California.","These were complicated redevelopments we spend multiple years, and we\u2019re pleased to have completed construction at a cost below the expectations we laid out of this time last year, and within the timeline we provided at that time. Today we are over 85% leased up at Lincoln and nearly 75% of Preserve, and Keith and his teams are achieving rents above underwriting at both communities.","During the quarter, we continue to redevelopment of our Park Towne Place and Sterling properties both located in Center City, Philadelphia. We are executing both of these redevelopments in phases, providing us with the flexibility to adjust as we go, depending on product acceptance and competing supply.","We\u2019ve commenced preleasing of the redevelopment tower at Park Towne Place, and the second phase of apartment homes at the Sterling. How we are in the early days rents are coming in above underwriting in both projects. Construction is nearly completed Aimco\u2019s 2,900 on first redevelopment in Seattle and work is progressing as planned at our Ocean House on prospect redevelopment in Ohio, California. Construction also continues on only redevelopment project, one canal in Boston.","During the quarter we invested $18 million in this project and not withstanding some scheduling pressures during the severe winter weather. Still anticipate completion of this project during the second quarter of 2016, and within our original budget.","Before I move to our acquisition activity, I would like to point out that as we do once a year, we have updated our revenue projections for the redevelopment and development projects that has been on Supplemental Schedule 10 for more than a year. This annual update takes into consideration market rent growth over the last 12 months and in goes project to-date [indiscernible] great achievement.","Revenue expectations were increased at Lincoln Place, Preserve at Marin 2,900 on first and One Canal. For our more recent projects Ocean House, Park Towne Place and Sterling our original estimates remain in place. We have updated our yield projections on these projects and now expect a weighted average NOI yield, excluding future market rent growth of 5.6%. This is a 20 basis point increase from our previous estimate with cap rates remaining flat to down on these markets \u2013 in the markets where these assets are located, we believe these investments are driving even greater value creation.","On the acquisition\u2019s front, we purchased in the first quarter 94 apartment home community located in Atlanta between Midtown and Buckhead were $38 million. The community was built in 2008 to condominiums specifications and has average revenue per apartment home of over $3,600.","Subsequent to quarter end we acquired \u2013 I have certificate of occupancy for $63 million our newly developed 115 apartment home community located in the Kendall Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. We have started leasing up the end upon stabilization, expect the average revenue per apartment home to be over $3,500.","As we look ahead into the rest of the year, we will continue to follow our fair trade approach to portfolio management. As you will see in our earnings release, we have increased our guidance for property sales from $250 million to $275 million at the midpoint. This guidance increase reflects additional asset sales to fund year-to-date acquisitions. We now expect to generate net proceeds to Aimco of a $150 million to $160 million, a $20 million increase at the midpoint.","We continue to look for opportunities to upgrade our portfolio through selective prepared trades, if we find the right investments we will adjust our guidance for property sales accordingly.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernie Freedman","Thanks, John. I will start the day with first quarter 2015 results. The FFO of $0.46 per share was $1.10 per share ahead of the high end of our guidance range. And FFO was right at the high end of our guidance ranged $0.52 per share. The FFO [indiscernible] the high end of our guidance range due to the FFO out performance as well as lower capital replacement standing them planned, which we expect to make up during the balance of the year. And then, these results were a couple of offsetting non-recurring items I would like to point out. First, casualty losses were $2.5 million or $1.05 per share higher than we had expected due to the extreme winter conditions in the Northeast. We also incurred $1.7 million or $0.01 per share penalties on the repayment of two property loans that were scheduled to mature next year.","The prepayment penalties were less than the interest that would have been paid until their maturity dates. So we proceeds from our January equity offering to retire the debts. These items were offset by $0.01 related to the reversal of the litigation reserve and $0.01 of deferred asset management fees.","We came in at the high end of our guidance for same-store operating results with revenues 4.4% higher than first quarter 2014, offset by expense growth of 2.9% leading to NOI growth of 5.2%. We did experience higher than anticipated expense growth during the first quarter as a result of the severe winter weather in the Northeast, but this was more than offset by higher revenue growth.","On the balance sheet in January, we raised $357 million through a common equity offering and have used the proceeds to pay off of our line of credit. Redeem our CRA preferred equity and pay off three property loans. 20 of our communities are now unencumbered with an estimated growth asset value of $1.3 billion. We plan to repay additional property loans later this year when they open up for prepayment without penalty.","As Terry mentioned S&P upgraded Aimco to investment grade at March. We have net features published guidelines to consider up investment grade and are hopeful we\u2019ll receive good news later this year.","Reaching investment grade with an important accomplishment for Aimco and our team. We remain committed to continuing to improve our balance sheet by reducing leverage further and increasing the sides of our unencumbered pool. This reduction will be realized through amortization of property debt [indiscernible] earnings and by increasing earnings as redevelopment and acquisition properties are stabilized. On investment grade rating allows us for future consideration of use unsecured debt Aimco does not anticipate doing so.","Moving onto the subject of our common dividend, as Terry mentioned, we announced earlier this week our board of directors approved an increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $1.20 per share were a 15% increase from our dividend in 2014.","In determining an appropriate dividend payout the board seeks to retain enough cash flow from operations to fund capital replacement spending and the required principle amortization of our property debt. With our continued overall decline in capital replacement spending due to our [indiscernible] portfolio management discipline, and our accelerated deleveraging that occurred earlier this year with our January equity offering, the board recognize the opportunity to increase our dividend. At this higher dividend rate, we are now paying out approximately 65% of our AFFO.","Looking ahead in operations, we are increasing our full same-store revenue growth projections to reflect our expectation of stronger results in 2015. We now anticipate same-store revenue growth between 4% and 4.5%.","On the expense side, our expectations for the full year remain unchanged at a growth rate of 2.5% to 3%. With these expectations, we now project full year higher NOI growth of 4.5% to 5.5%.","For the second quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.51 to $0.55 per share and AFFO is projected to be $0.42 o $0.46 per share. Year-over-year conventional same-store NOI growth is projected to be 4.25% to 5.25%. Second quarter conventional same-store NOI is projected to be up 1.5% to 2.5% compared to the first quarter. We have increased both full year pro forma FFO and AFFO.","Before we take questions I\u2019d like to point out one item in our supplemental schedules. As we do at the beginning of each year, we evaluated each of our properties and our non same-store portfolios to determine whether inclusion in same-store for the upcoming years appropriate. This year we determined at eight of our Manhattan properties meet our same-store definition and these properties are now reflected in our same-store results on scheduled steps.","Finally, I would like to let everyone know that we will be hosting in an Investor Day in Philadelphia in early October, which will include towards of our Park Towne Place in Sterling redevelopments. We will also be hosting towards our West Coast redevelopment properties in Lincoln Place, Preserve at Marin and Pacific Bay Vistas that we could sell later, but for more information with specific dates from Elizabeth Coalson in coming weeks.","With that we will now open up the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Erne, I will turn it over to you for the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico, UBS.","Nick Ylico","Thanks. I was wondering on the topic of like asset sales. How do you view what\u2019s going on in the market right now. I mean M&A\u2019s picking up pricing our portfolios. Is this pretty strong and yeah I don\u2019t think you guys have shop like a portfolio of larger portfolio of assets in some time. How do you think about maybe taking advantage of the sales market in a bigger way rather than just selling off individual assets and doing a sort of a bigger portfolio sale?","Terry Considine","Nick this is Terry. Thank you very much for your question. It\u2019s a question we ask ourselves and review regularly and the two factors we consider in particular. The first is whether we get a better execution in a portfolio or one by one. And so far we\u2019ve concluded that we maximize proceeds to Aimco by selling individual properties rather than in a larger portfolio transaction.","Of course the second very large governor is the reinvestment opportunity. We look at this is not just a question of whether we can make an advantage sale, but whether we can reinvest the proceeds in properties that have higher rents, that they are consistent with our market allocations. And that have higher growth prospects. And that\u2019s the real governor our rate of sales and John\u2019s done a good job, but we encourage him to go and find more. John, do you have anything to indentify?","John Bezzant","No that you\u2019ve got it.","Nick Ylico","Okay, thanks and just lastly, you\u2019re getting the benefit this year from the historic tax credits. Looking out after this year, it does \u2013 is there any benefit last next year or is it only if you start additional redevelopment projects where you might get that benefit? Thanks.","John Bezzant","That case Arne [ph], that\u2019s a correct observation that we\u2019ve provided in 2015 what we only expect historic tax credits in the project we currently have in place. And we are successful with the first space of Park town and continue doing further phases at Park town, each of those phases [indiscernible] historic tax credit associated with them, those are the credits are available for entire project.","And so we are certainly optimistic and we are off to get start at Park town and if we do move forward to phase 2 to phase 3 to phase 4 each of those would have historic tax credits certainly over the next couple of years. Similarly, if we get to the situation where we complete all of sterling in Philadelphia which would be a few more phases to go that will also be eligible for some tax credits.","So those two projects specifically we have a line of sight to see that we have some historic tax credit available to us. And not quite at the amount you\u2019ve seen that are in the number this year. So they decrease on and as we look at future redevelopment opportunities certainly any of our projects that are in the eight ranges that potentially put up historic tax credit. So it should be properties that are over 50 years old. We get that consideration is to something that could help with the economics and make sense for what we want to company on an extensible we want it different from construction standpoint.","Nick Ylico","All right. Thanks guys.","Terry Considine","Thanks Nick.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi Group.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Terry, you talked about the portfolio continuing to improve in terms of the quality and average rent per unit. Is there risk to get into too high of a price per unit and introducing more volatility to results. Then how do you balance that price point diversification that you talked about with improving the portfolio quality from here?","Terry Considine","Nick, that\u2019s just a terrific question. Again that something that we think about all the time. A have \u2013 and high price points have many good qualities, but they bare with them some risk it\u2019s a risk that price point is the one more subject to competitive new building. And so, the way we think about that is to most for two points for protection. First of all geographic diversification as you know we are more highly diversified geographically than many. And we hope that by doing so that we will be in a recovery mode and in Washington, D.C. by the time that the bay area is over built and vice versa. The second thing is we give a great emphasis to location, location, location, it\u2019s the watchword to real estate, but we look for those not just submarkets, but those special locations which are not as exposed to competitive new building an example of which would be our Preserve at Marin project in Corte Madera, California or prospectively our [indiscernible].","Nick Joseph ","Thanks. And then you mentioned a 68% for renewals been sent out in maybe May and June. What spread you expect to see there?","Keith Kimmel","Nick, this is Keith. We typically see about a 100 basis point melt from the asked ultimate degree.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Terry Considine","Thank you, Nick.","Operator","Next question comes from Rob Stevenson at Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Hi, good afternoon guys. Terry, I appreciate the additional color on the redevelopment on the existing redevelopment stuff. Can you talk a little bit about what you guys have keyed up to stark this year and what the overall sort of redevelopment file looks like within Aimco currently that sort of would meet your return for [indiscernible] currently?","Terry Considine","Rob, that again a terrific questions on one we\u2019re focused on, but one that is best answered by Patti Fielding who are head of that operation, Patti?","Patti Fielding","Hi, Rob the process we started in 2015, we are from carryover in the 2016 and beyond. We have the opportunity for spend on additional phases of Sterling between $34 million to $44 million and Park Towne between $88 million to $100 million. Both of these projects are in Center City, Philadelphia. This of course assumes that each of the projects continues to progress well. As a reminder, each phase app sterling represents three to five floors of the 29 story high-rise in each phase at Park Towne represents one of the four 19 story towers.","Yorktown is a project outside of Chicago that we expect to kick off later this year. And much of this spending will occur beyond 2015. We anticipate the first part of the redevelopment among incorporate the current 15 story tower and a five story midrise building. Yorktown we also have excess land created from an earlier rebuilding of the parking structure. A later phase may incorporate adding density to the size like we did it in [indiscernible].","We anticipate announcing the first phase and its cost and economic later this year. We have opportunity at our lot of properties that we own in a joint venture with JPM. Our focus today has been on the amenities in the Plato West. We have the opportunity to renovate the remaining homes at west as well as at Plato East. And our smaller more boutique property is Villas property. We anticipate announcing this next day is later this year.","Finally, we\u2019re really excited about our plans around Yacht Club community in the Miami, neighborhood of Brickell. This is a 357 home high-rise, our plans including investment and enhanced arrival experience, amenities, apartment finishes and the potential addition of a restaurant. This is another project we\u2019ll provide details on later this year. Those projects are likely to be up next. My team is looking hard and another dozen or so opportunities currently that will help to back bill 2016 and 2017. We are looking the projects at New York, suburban Washington D.C., Denver, the Bay area and San Diego. The limited process, not the number of opportunities frankly it\u2019s our appetite for risk. As we look to spend about 2% to 3% of our growth asset value a year. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then Erne. Can you talk a little bit about your comments about not looking to do unsecured debt in the future? Mean what drives that decision, is it just pricing, is it additional stuff that you have do in order to do with deal. Can you provide some color there? ","Ernie Freedman","No Rob it\u2019s really around risk appetite. We\u2019re just comfortable, we\u2019re not concerned around pricing as we certainly see today that we\u2019re able to get profit debit depending on what the quality of the property, location of the property that certainly competitive with unsecured financing. It\u2019s really around \u2013 what we close down for the last 20 years and managing our risk around the balance sheet in that. We like using non-recourse, long-dated, fixed rate amortizing property debt. That said I do like the option of having unsecured in our backlog, it is that something that we would need to pursue.","And frankly Rob we haven\u2019t talked to Rating Agencies about that, we\u2019re not looking to do it. So we may certainly have to do something little bit differently we have today. But by having investment great from SMP and hopefully one not too far away. It\u2019s a much easier discussion to have, but we certainly, I don\u2019t want to mislead anyone by getting investment grade and we\u2019re considering something else. So we put a lot of value on optionality [ph]. We like having the option, we like having that available to us \u2013 it\u2019s that something considering in the future. But as of today we\u2019re very comfortable with our current strategy and continue to grow on our pool and flexibility and maintaining our low leverage by just employing profit debt and importantly for preferred equity. ","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Jordan Sadler ","Thank you. Quick one on the portfolio overall and the current scale in the context of \u2013 where this portfolio has been over time. Your questions about additional sales and I\u2019m \u2013 as I look across your portfolio and see markets where you\u2019ve got \u2013 one or two communities. I\u2019m curious, given your perspective overtime. Are there benefits of scale and what do your thoughts on these smaller markets for Aimco.","John Bezzant","Jordan, am I right, the scale you are asking about is operating scale and operating efficiency?","Jordan Sadler","Correct.","John Bezzant","Yes. There are some advantages in having a concentration in a particular market. They are not as huge as in other say manufacturing businesses, but there is a very real what I know in management which is said it\u2019s a fewer places to call and it is easier for keeping this team to get there and have their feet on the ground and hands around the problems that we\u2019re looking at. So I think overtime we are likely to either get larger or smaller or larger or exit markets in which we have only one or two properties.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. And then, I guess regarding the redevelopment, I didn\u2019t quite catch, is there a current yield on Lincoln Place that you could kind of offer give us some context? And just the targeted yield on redevelopment and the 2% to 3% per year. Is there a hurdle?","Ernie Freedman","Sure, this is Ernie. We have not disclosed specifically yields on individual project. That\u2019s actually something that we will provide at our Investor Day as we get further along in the rent up to be give you more of the real number versus what I say more the hypothetical number based on how think things are going. That said, with the information we disclosed in Schedule 10 in using a reasonable assumption around margin is, you will get pretty close to what yield would be on something like we can place. For the entire redevelopment portfolio, John mentioned that we are projecting a yield overall 5.6% on that current growth. So that\u2019s the answer to your question on Lincoln Place. Jordan, the other question, if you could just remind me, please.","Jordan Sadler","Sure, just is there a hurdle rate in terms of the 2% to 3% redevelopment spend annually you would target?","Ernie Freedman","John, you want talk about how we have tried to do that and repair trade with perspective and we try to target for the premium we expect from redevelopments?","John Bezzant","Sure, as we look at sales and which has been our primary source of capital for redevelopment and other investments that we make, we measure primarily at the free cash flow internal rate of return level. For an investment in an acquisition for example, on operating property, fully operating property, we do looking at a 150 basis points roughly, excuse me, now we are going to start with the baseline of an acquisition in our market, we would look at as our baseline for a yield. For redevelopment we would look at a 150 to 250 basis points above that, for a development we would look in the 200 basis points to 250 basis points above that as targeted yield at inception of the project.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. Thank you.","Ernie Freedman","Thanks John.","Operator","The next question comes from Jana Galan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","Hi, thank you. As you discuss, your capital recycling and geographic allocation goals. I was curious if you\u2019re reviewing any deals outside your target market and the one that comes to mind is National has been trending very well for you for the last few quarters? ","Terry Considine","John? ","John Bezzant","Sure. We look actively in all of the markets that we are in that we are targeted. The National is one of ours that I would tell is kind of on the soft cusp of our target market strategy. We do continue to look at transactions and opportunities there, we\u2019ve obviously not found any. And we do look regularly at disposition opportunities within and outside of the target markets, primarily outside, but within the target markets focused on where we can sell and make a trade, a pair trade to come out of, if you will an older or more suburban asset with lesser prospects into one that we feel has greater prospects that that goes on everyday all across the portfolio. ","Jana Galan","Thank you and I was wondering if you could tried a little bit more detail on how Washington performed in the quarter and particularly the trends you\u2019re seeing in April by submarket? ","Keith Kimmel","Ron. This is Keith, I will take that. What we are seeing is \u2013 we are definitely seeing an improvement from where we stood a year ago, as we think about two markets that we really are in suburban Maryland and suburban Virginia specifically. And in suburban Maryland that would be where we are seeing more strength. In suburban Virginia, specifically with there is some more inventory that we had to work our way through and so we\u2019ve got to work to that. ","But generally speaking what we\u2019re seeing is some acceleration and definitely improvement from where a year ago? ","Jana Galan","And Keith you just want a comment maybe on you\u2019ve seen from January through April with regards to Louisiana connectivity? ","Keith Kimmel","Sure, Ernie Yana what Ernie is referring to is we\u2019ve some acceleration, specifically around new lease pricing. From January, February, March and through April we\u2019ve seen is a sequential improvement every month. In January as an example, we are at \u2013 seeing negative 5% on new leases, now in April just barely negative 1%. So there has definitely been some improvement, but with that being said, there is more work to be done. ","Jana Galan","Thank you, Keith. ","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Jana. ","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Zelmam & Associates. ","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. Some of you just talk a little bit about Yark position and plan yes may those written contemplated as a Condo and then was converted to rental. Did you buy there was any thought of converting into condos, at some point in the future or you think about this is a as rental going forward? ","Terry Considine","Now we really bought it as a rental and looked to operate it as a rental going forward. All of our underwriting is done on a rental basis, we don\u2019t assume a condo exit to justify a purchase. ","Dan Oppenheim","Okay and then just overall you talked about increasing assumption for acquisitions as primarily based on the two way lender in Cambridge, not so much optimism that\u2019s even easier to buy over the remainder of the year, correct?","Ernie Freedman","Yeah, certainly we would measure that it is going to be easier to buy, I wouldn\u2019t though quality that we are continuing to look at opportunities every day, and so that opportunity for additional guidance for sales would be a direct result, if we are successful in finding other opportunities where we can make an accretive fair trade, that is an improvement to the portfolio.","Keith Kimmel","And in our original guidance for the year dispositions had some flexibility with its range to be able to fund a very low level acquisitions when you combine it, till John has done through April, that\u2019s why you seen them we move our disposition guidance up a little bit at the mid-point. So discover the funding for both of that acquisition.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks, very much.","Keith Kimmel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin at Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good afternoon.","Keith Kimmel","Hi, Drew.","Drew Babin","First question is just on submarkets within LA, story this year is obviously LA, kind of turning the growth part of your California trailing they take every markets, as the economy gained part of traction. You bring it down by submarket at all or you are seeing kind of just a broad pick-up in the entire market?","Terry Considine","Hey, gentleman, let me start now, kick it over to keys where I tell you that, keeping the teams, I actually thought pretty positive result in LA, as we finished up last year too so. It is good to see that LA is strengthening your seeing across the Board from [indiscernible], but we had pretty good success in acceleration in LA, starting early in 2014 that Keith and I just may talk about somewhat where our communities are and Ernie, what you are saying?","Terry Considine","Let me just if we think about Los Angles, really what we\u2019re seeing the strength is the West side of LA and Mid-Wilshire, our Palazzo Communities and Hillcrest and things of that nature. That\u2019s really what we are seeing the strength that has been building and in addition to that our Hillcrest Community, which is on the Board of Century City in Beverly Hills has also been really accelerating this 2015.","Drew Babin","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Question for Ernie on 2016 that maturities on, can you talk on about the and sorry if I miss something on this, the set up in terms of 2016, compared to 2015, where could there be a scenario possible where an equity issuance make sense early in the year to prepaid substantial maturities?","Ernie Freedman","Well, we certainly don\u2019t need to do that community continue to gets what we want from a leverage target perspective, and of course options are all is open. So we have been able to do actually over the last period of time, take advantage of adding some leverage to certain assets and taking those assets proceeds to pay-off other loans to keep growing on encumbered pool. We don\u2019t need to as when common equity to do that.","One of our larger maturities in 2016, early part of 2016, actually opens for prepayment in 2015, and it\u2019s for one of the best communities that we have in our portfolio. I would expect that that will actually refinanced in 2015 and we will do refinance they expect that properties or communities in a joint venture. So you actually see that the opportunity for us to potentially do something with maturities for 2015 or reasonably more in the back of 2016 not the first half.","Terry Considine","We\u2019re not concentrating issuing equity to pay down debt. So it were in a position where the equities trading at a real advantages price for us to consider it, it\u2019s certainly an option that\u2019s on the table but not one that I will consider in the base case.","Drew Babin","Great, thank you. That\u2019s all helpful.","Terry Considine","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from [indiscernible] BMO Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. It sounds like the S&T upgrade came ahead of your expectations as far s the timing, but I\u2019m still trying to understand why you are not contemplating using offering unsecured team ahead of your expectations as far as the timing, but I\u2019m still trying understand why you\u2019re not concentrating offering unsecured debt offering?","Unidentified Company Representative","I\u2019m sorry guys. The first was about the investment grade and not issuing, not giving unsecured developer.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. You mentioned you valued optimality, but I\u2019m trying to wonder why that you go to the process of getting investment rate credit rating, if you\u2019re not going to use it.","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, I guess couple of things I\u2019d say John. One, we\u2019ve met with the ratio agencies for 20 years and not been an unsecured borrower, because that\u2019s just something you do it as a public company. Two we haven\u2019t differently that we would have done anyway, it still just happens that the rating agency seen that what we are doing and say what others are doing. So we been committed for many years to bring leverage down we talked about as early as 2012 and we achieve that target about two years early and then we talk at the end of the 2013 or 2015.","We\u2019ve been committed to create a large [indiscernible] to provide profitability for maybe lower lever, let\u2019s say leverage in 30% and 35% range. It doesn\u2019t make sense to encumber maybe about a half of them at 60 and the other half without to get the number like that. So really is there anything different [indiscernible] enjoy going to see the fees quarterly and talking to them. It just they\u2019ve come around and say that we\u2019re doing works.","And we are very comfortable with our cost of capital, but more importantly we are very comfortable with the rest associate with how we finance the company, but as the CFO of the organization having more options is better than not. We don\u2019t plan on using it today. It wasn\u2019t a big effort to ask with the investment grade and it\u2019s good to know that if we do change our amount in the future or if the market is in the condition it would make sense for us to change them on that capability.","Unidentified Analyst","So, it\u2019s not a large amount but you have some professional prefer that\u2019s we deal above next year. Is that something that you could contemplating refinancing the mortgage from that.","Unidentified Company Representative","Certainly, we\u2019ve taken out prefers in the past and you\u2019ve referring to, I believe our Class B came out in 2011 would be redeemable. If we feel at that time that that\u2019s a cost of capital doesn\u2019t make sense and we could replace it. We are certainly give consideration to doing a new preferred equity offering it had cheaper price, significantly cheaper price more that today 7%. And\/or replacing that with the longer-term debt, but we like John, just make sure it clear. We like having a weighted average maturity that that\u2019s much longer versus much shorter and I think as you know, compared to our peers one longest and we lever that professional preferred equity is just that as perpetual. That doesn\u2019t come to, so forever equity in the 6% to 7% range is a pretty good spot and certainly will be a better stock person, the future having one if not two investment grades. And so we will keep that as an option for us as well. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then I had a follow-up on the disposition guidance. Did it\u2019s increased because you expect better pricing on disposition or is it composition change or you\u2019re throwing more assets. What is the primary reason? ","Unidentified Company Representative","Purely to have the cash available to pay for the two properties that the communities that John acquired during the first quarter and being part in the second quarter. Our original guidance contemplated that John will have some flexibility to just require a small property and now that he has completed the two at a combined purchase price, a little over $100 million. We just want to balance our sources and users. So it\u2019s just around balancing that out from activity that\u2019s happened today, then we\u2019ll developing the development activity as anticipated for the remainder of the year. ","Unidentified Analyst","So they are different assets that you\u2019re looking or so. ","Unidentified Company Representative","No at this point, there will be one asset that was added to the list to get us to a higher number than we originally contemplated, yes. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got it. Thank you. ","Unidentified Company Representative","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. ","Dave Bragg","Hi, good afternoon. ","Unidentified Company Representative","Hi, Dave. ","Dave Bragg","First question for you it relates to the just the disclosure on CapEx. It looks like you account for a $1,000 unit and your AFFO calculation about $1,200 in your free cash flow why the difference between the two? ","Ernie Freedman","Sure, one is I would say it\u2019s more economic and one is the accounting rules that we\u2019ve established many years ago Dave around accounting for capital replacement. The capital improvement spending, got and getting too much detail on how we do that, we will try to understand we acquired an asset how much of the asset has been used up to that point and if we\u2019re replacing that asset which is buy or make an improvement to it. ","I know we\u2019ve talked about that over years with folks on how we do that. In reality we think the economics around what happens if capital replacement is, it\u2019s closer $1,200 and frankly maybe even a little bit higher. And so we want to use a consistent number and a consistent measure that doesn\u2019t it\u2019s not impacted by timing from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year on larger capital plans. ","And so when John puts together both our projected IRs what we own today, as well as any underwriting that he is doing with Paddy on redevelopment projects on acquisitions. We want to use that consistent $1,200 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve chosen to keep it there. ","Dave Bragg","Okay, thank you, Ernie. Second question thanks for the disclosure is always on disposition, cap rates and free cash flow cap rates. Can you provide the same for the acquisitions that you\u2019ve made so far this year? ","Ernie Freedman","Dave as you know in the past we\u2019ve shied away from giving specific cap rates, but we hope I giving the rents and buy showing a reasonable margin assumption that you can make. You can triangulate and get pretty close somewhat cap rates would be. If I tell you from a free cash flow IR perspective, we expect both of these acquisitions John do you 100 basis points plus over what we had the properties that we sold anything you want to comment there? ","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, and I think we even my comments our total investments we think are through read out acquisitions everything else, free cash flow, cap rates in excess of 5% of stabilization. I can call out on the Cambridge deal that we just bought closed late last week, it\u2019s empty. It\u2019s a brand new building just completed and so today the cap rate is zero, I will give you that. And that we expected it will stabilize above the 47 free cash flow cap rate on the sales that we made to fund it. ","Dave Bragg","And stabilize for you all, what does that mean, what timeframe there on both Atlanta and the Cambridge deal? ","Unidentified Company Representative","Atlanta is stabilized today at those rents over $3600, the Cambridge deal stabilization for us is lease up, which is modeled based on what we think the period would be on any given asset on that particular one. We would anticipate it being leased up later this year. And then really one cycle of turn that whether we get stabilize. As Terry noted in his comments on our redevelopments for example, we see there are implicit or explicit construction period discounts or concessions that are done during lease up while construction is going on around it. And we expect it in the normal lease up on the newly acquired building like Axiom that there will be some level of concessions to give the building leased up in a season. ","And then we expect that after a year or two we burn those off and recapture them. So stabilization in our model on a new building like Axiom would be in your three. ","Unidentified Company Representative","And Dave importantly we talk about the stabilized deals, we have done a good market rent growth, as we consider those and we gave our redevelopment yields, there as friends today not in the future in which as John just described in a property like Cambridge that stabilized yield that he is talking about certainly [indiscernible] in 24 months out, because when he described, but he is not including market rent growth that may occur between now and then. ","So that would only be it, market continues to grow in Cambridge, there will just be an addition to that number. ","Dave Bragg","Okay, thanks for that, one last question you provide specific disposition guidance we can see that we are not then you explained that because you did more acquisitions than expected in the first quarter. But did you also say that your expectations for acquisitions is your \u2013 have continued to increase over the balance of the year, what shall we think about as a right number for acquisitions in 2015 to go at this poor number? ","Unidentified Company Representative","Dave I will tell you that we are out in the hunt every day. We don\u2019t have anything under contract today to buy. But we bid actively and aggressively every week, we put otherwise that on deals around the country. And we don\u2019t land very many of them, our numbers last year and in gross, gross terms we looked at about 400 deals. We under wrote and offered on a little over 200 deals and we bought six. And so, as we look at this year we anticipate \u2013 we\u2019re going to retain that same momentum that we have on the bidding side and we\u2019ll buy something. We bought these two deals that we\u2019ve disclosed today. And we\u2019ll buy some more over the course of the year, but I honestly can\u2019t tell you because the market is so competitive out there and that I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to land one out of a 100 or one out of the 1000.","Dave Bragg","Thank you.","Terry Considine","And Dave, I guess one last comment to make on that is that we were not looking to crazily or wildly grow the info portfolio. We talk about the fact that we would expect to sell about 5% to 10% of our properties on a yearly basis to fund reinvestment. And our current disposition guidance right now, we are at about 3% and for two to last three years we didn\u2019t do much more than that. We did maybe 4% to 5% last year, we did do more, and we did about 7%. So our current disposition guidance has laid out funds everything that we\u2019ve laid out for you. The two acquisitions that John has done as well as our plan spending on redevelopment and then the development project for one canal for the rest of the year.","John has staffed to see if we can find better communities for us to be invest in what have today. And we \u2013 [indiscernible] health successful, but there is likely that it won\u2019t be, but there is also a possibility that it will be and you will see as we go out for the year. Some more dispositions hired in guidance level that fund potentially accretive acquisitions but not wildly grow the info portfolio but to see if we can get a chain on this continued mark as John has lead us on in terms of improved portfolio quality.","Dave Bragg","Okay. Thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thanks Dave.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Anderson with BMO.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. I guess my first question potentially awkward question but there always the most one. Terry, assuming \u2013 Terry you\u2019re going to work and tell you a 150 years old and no one will be surprised by that, and it would look at kind of good plat [ph] fundamentals in the multifamily space, you know what I mean, the chatter both real and potentially imagined, from your perspective what happens first, succession or sale?","Terry Considine","At income?","Rich Anderson","Yeah.","Terry Considine","Or?","Rich Anderson","Meaning you relinquish your roll or the company gets sold?","Terry Considine","Based on everything I know today, we\u2019re going to continue to operate for those through that 150 years. Entering to these 43 year loans for example that finance Lincoln Place at Venice I worry a lot about the refunding risk that I\u2019m going to have to deal with 2055.","Rich Anderson","So the answer is in a succession unless you\u2019ve got a magic portion. That we are not aware, is that right?","Terry Considine","Some of these information is proprietary.","Rich Anderson","Okay, and then just really basic question for Ernie, Schedule One is missing the weighted average shares, I am wondering where that is?","Ernie Freedman","I will check on that and we will get that out to Rich, if they got neglected this time I want make sure it is available for everyone.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Ernie Freedman","I appreciate when that \u2013 will get that up.","Rich Anderson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Salinsky at RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Salinsky","Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to backset to Dave\u2019s question there, because you touch recycling and acquisitioned. As you continue with the recycling of the portfolio still in the bottom 10%, moving that money back into redevelopment, but in the acquisition, at what point you get to the point where you really can\u2019t shrink portfolio much larger without losing efficiencies or scale in markets?","Ernie Freedman","Well, I\u2019ll start with there, Mike. I think as we look at it, there is still plenty of runway. I want to point out that we are buying part of the reason for the acquisitions\u2019 activity is that we are acquiring and keeping the size of the enterprise as the same or even bigger. And then it what was from asset value standpoint, and that\u2019s our goal.","From a unit count standpoint, I would look at the process as one of the distillation more than anything else. And that as we look at these 12 to 15 target markets, within them our unit accounts may in fact shrink, but our goal is to have the dollars reallocated and to grow within that when that growth would be true, we hope higher revenue growth in assets that we select in selling out of lower revenue growth markets and higher margins and just the opportunities that we see as we distill by choice, the portfolio into these 12 to 15 target markets.","And I maybe should follow on what the silence of my own answering at the bit more. I don\u2019t know is there is a magic number that we look at say this is too small. We are really looking at it literally paired trade asset by asset, once it value to us on a free cash flow or internal rate of return basis and can we do better.","Keith Kimme","What I might add John, Mike, you study this and thought about this before some Mike said. The company is [indiscernible] by gross asset value grown. Its capitals increasingly concentrated in fewer units, but those units are ones that are efficiently operated and may even benefit by increased focus of having a smaller footprint. And I think the impact on the portfolio quality has been quite substantial and I think it will continue to be quite substantial. I think we\u2019ll be quite pleased to look back in three years to see that the three years past was prolong to continue portfolio update.","Michael Salinsky","No, that\u2019s helpful [indiscernible] my second question here just in terms of the focus on free cash IRR or NAV. And then you look the different CapEx needs of A\u2019s versus B\u2019s, I mean, if you look at your acquisitions over the last couple of years \u2013 over the last two years predominantly a properties you redeveloping something you\u2019re moving this up base can you continue \u2013 as you look at the portfolio today. I mean, is it inherently going to increase more on the A side. How do you balance out the diversification of A or B\u2019s and C\u2019s versus the free cash flow IRR growth potential of an A?","Terry Considine","Well the free cash flow IRR growth potential of an A or B is depended on multiple factors including price. And we would like to be balanced between A\u2019s and B\u2019s. But we are \u2013 the underlying theme will be as that we are selecting for A ground, because the B\u2019s that we find attractive will be ones that are in wonderful locations that overtime Patti will be able to redevelop and upgrade. And so that sort of the balance point. We might be buying at a B\u2019s price point, but hopefully, it\u2019s A ground.","Keith Kimme","I would add to Mike that the \u2013 just to get into the nitty-gritty on the [indiscernible] deal example in Atlanta. Very high end finishes, wood floors these kind of things that are a higher turn cost. Our free cash flow internal rate to return that we calculate for that acquisition incorporates a higher cost for turns on that property to reflect the fact that it\u2019s go worth appliances and higher end finishes and these are the things going on. And then also includes that $1,200 door capital replacement reserve as thus every deal that we buy. So right, we think that the free cash flow internal rate to return through both expense modeling turn cost and the capital replacement budget accurately reflects the additional cost that we put into refer asset grade. Thanks Mike.","Terry Considine","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Mr. Considine would you like to make any closing remarks?","Terry Considine","Yes, thank you very much and thanks for all of you on the call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn. Please go ahead.","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment including projections related to 2017 and 2018 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, EVP in charge of Property Operations, John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","And I'll now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Aimco first quarter results were consistent with our expectations and our guidance for the full year is unchanged. As my colleagues will discuss in detail, first quarter property operations were on track, redevelopment activities continue to meet our targets for value creation. As our work in Philadelphia nears completion, Patti has started a substantial overhaul of Calhoun Beach Club in Minneapolis. Keith's execution of our lease ups has been exceptional and that assignment is largely completed.","The Aimco balance sheet remains strong with abundant liquidity and limited exposure to capital markets. For the fifth consecutive year, Aimco was recognized by the Denver Post as one of Colorado's top workplaces. And AFFO, our preferred measure for current period profitability, was a penny ahead of the midpoint of guidance. That said, we remain cautious about the many factors that impact our business, just as we were at the start of the year. The supply of new apartments continues to increase and there are many markets where new lease rent increases have slowed or turned negative.","This especially impacts A price point communities. Our portfolio strategy emphasizes geographic and price point diversification to provide some protection from these predictable results of the local building cycle. In the quarter, this worked well. Weaker new leased rates at the A price point were offset by stronger B price point pricing, solid renewal rate and improvements elsewhere in our business. As we look forward, we expect new supply to continue to pressure new lease pricing at the A price point.","Our successful navigation of these choppy waters will turn on our execution of the numerous other tasks that drive our business, including customer satisfaction and retention, consistency, cost control, innovation and value creation through redevelopment. Happily, we have a cohesive and high achieving team with the requisite experience and commitment. For this, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco team mates, here in Denver and across the country. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work with you.","And now for a more detailed report on the first quarter, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a solid first quarter in operations, with revenues up 3.4%; expenses up 2.7%; net operating income, up 3.7%. Turnover for the quarter was 50.5%, 50 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016. Move out reasons for the quarter are unchanged versus recent results or our long term averages. And our residents gave us better than a four star rating in customer satisfaction for the 14th consecutive quarter, with our best score ever achieved at 4.24 stars out of a possible five.","Looking at rates, which transacted in the quarter. Blended lease rates were up 1.9%, with renewal rents having solid increases of 5.1%. We saw particular strength in Seattle, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Boston. Renewal rents in these markets increased 6% to 8% compared to the expiring leases. Where those leases expired and were not renewed, our new leases were 1% below the prior lease, as we continued navigating choppy waters in a few markets.","Los Angeles and Denver continue to be the most heavily impacted by supply, especially of the A price point Los Angeles. Los Angeles and Denver combined for a negative 3.2% lease price and a softer average daily occupancy year-over-year. Average daily occupancy for the two markets was a combined 95.4%, some 100 basis points below prior year. The balance of our same store portfolio saw a new lease pricing finish about flat for the quarter, with average daily occupancy at 95.9% within 10 basis points of prior year.","Turning to the first quarter revenue growth, our 12 primary markets were up 3.7% for the quarter. The top performers had revenue increases from almost 6% to nearly 10% for the quarter. This was led by Seattle followed by Boston and San Diego. Our strong performers which had revenue growth between 4% and 5% were Atlanta and New York. Our steady markets with roughly 3% percent revenue growth were Chicago, the Bay Area, Denver, Washington D.C. and Miami and with revenue growth at or above 2.5%, we had Philadelphia and Los Angeles.","Finally in looking at our early second quarter results, preliminary April blended lease rates are up 2.1% with renewals up 4.5% and new leases improving by 100 basis points versus first quarter to flat versus last April. When comparing our new lease performance of As versus Bs, there is nearly a 300 basis point spread, with our As down 1.8% for the month, while Bs are currently up 1.1% for April. April\u2019s average daily occupancy is on plan at 95.6% and May and June renewal offers went out with 4.5% to 6.5% increases.","With great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco\u2019s success, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. During the first quarter, our investment and lease up activities were executed as planned. We invested $41 million in redevelopment and development, about half of which was in our phases projects in Center City, Philadelphia, Park Towne Place and the Sterling. At Park Towne Place, the lease up of the South tower is complete and as of today, the East towers 84% leased, which is in line with our plan and our achieved rental rates are consistent with our underwriting. Construction on the north tower is on schedule and we're off to a successful start with our pre-leasing with nearly 15% of the tower leased before our first deliveries.","Those deliveries came last week and move-ins have commenced. We also completed the redevelopment of the Sterling\u2019s apartment homes, where as of today 89% of the homes are leased and the results of the redevelopment are consistent with underwriting. During the quarter, redevelopment continued as planned at three other projects that were underway at year end and we\u2019ve decided to slower pace of work a bit at the Palazzo Park La Brea in Los Angeles as we absorbed some excess inventory.","We also started a phased redevelopment at Calhoun Beach Club, a mixed use residential community, located in Minneapolis. Over the next few years, we anticipate investing about $29 million in redevelopment of 275 apartment homes and the updating of common areas. And as Terry noted, our lease ups at One Canal and Indigo are all, but put to bed. Keith and his team successfully completed the lease up of One Canal in Boston during the first quarter and at Indigo in Redwood City, California, 90% of the apartment homes are leased today and we expect a complete lease up in the second quarter.","And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thank you, John. I'd like to cover today a number of subjects, starting with our financial results for the first quarter. AFFO of $0.51 per share and FFO of $0.58 per share were each one penny ahead of the midpoints of our respective guidance ranges, driven by operating results slightly ahead of our expectations and lower than anticipated interest and G&A expenses.","Next, on the balance sheet. We continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and close two property loans, totaling $65 million. The loans have tenure terms, are fixed rates, amortizing, and non-recourse to Aimco. The weighted average interest rate on the loans of 3.71% represents a weighted average spread of 134 basis points over the corresponding treasury rates at the time of pricing.","Quarter end leverage to EBITDA was consistent with plan and on track to meet our year-end target. Liquidity remains high. At quarter end, our $600 million line was largely unused and our unencumbered pool of communities was valued at 1.6 billion.","Turning to guidance, our views on 2017 AFFO and FFO are unchanged from the start of the year. In last night's releases, we established second quarter AFFO guidance of $0.46 to $0.50 per share and FFO guidance of $0.56 to $0.60 per share. We are maintaining full year same store guidance with revenue year-over-year growth of 3.25% to 4.25%, expense growth of 2.5% to 3% and NOI growth of 3.5% to 5%.","Before we open up the call for questions, I would like to update you on our annual revisions to our supplemental schedules. In 2011, when Aimco decided to wind down its affordable business, we owned 108 affordable communities. At the end of 2016, we owned only 7 and two of these communities are under contract to be sold. For our 2017 reporting, we'll be including these 7 communities in our real estate portfolio.","Also in 2011, we held nominal ownership position in a number of limited partnerships, holding 64 low income housing tax credit or LIHTC communities. We now hold 47 in the partnership agreements prior their liquidation over the next five years or so. As we described to you last fall and our third quarter net asset value calculation, which is posted on our website, our relationship with these partnerships is different than real estate ownership and is better described as an asset management business. Aimco provides services to these partnerships and receives fees and other payments in return.","To the extent amounts due Aimco are not paid currently, the balance is accrued and are satisfied from the partnership\u2019s future operating or liquidating cash flows. Aimco has limited upside or downside exposure. We value this business at the present value of the future cash flows we expect to receive. In order to provide better visibility into the contributions of our real estate portfolio and our asset management business, we have updated our supplemental schedules to present separately FFO and balance sheet amounts for each.","In connection with this changed presentation, we have identified both the assets and liabilities of the LIHTC partnerships. This change in presentation has no impact on Aimco economics, limited impact on most metrics and some impact on our calculation of leverage to EBITDA, lowering our first quarter ratio from 6.9 to 6.7 times. Consistent with our commitment to transparency, we have included in the supplemental schedules, the calculation of leverage to EBITDA, both under the current presentation, which excludes the related LIHTC debt and also under the previous presentation, which included the LIHTC debt.","A second change to the supplemental schedules identifies Aimco ownership line by line, making it easier to calculate Aimco proportion of results. In the third change, we've expanded supplemental schedule 10 to include information to help users calculate Aimco asset value for communities classified as redevelopment and development. Our objective of making these revisions to our supplemental schedules is to provide you with ready access to the information useful to understand the Aimco business, operations and value. We thank those of you whose suggestions have shaped these changes and hope that they will prove useful to all of you.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Nick Yulico at UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Hey, everyone. First quarter same store revenue growth, I guess I'm wondering, is there anything that drove that down that was unusual on the sort of other income piece or anything.","Paul Beldin","Yeah. Nick, this is Paul. Thank you for that question. You're right, you'll likely notice that our other income growth was only 60 bps year-over-year and that was actually quite a bit below our expectations, but the reason for that is actually a net positive to NOI in that we had much lower utility expenses than what we expected, which was driven by warmer weather and in turn we had lower utility reimbursements. And just as a reference point, our net rental income or so - our true rental growth during the quarter was about 3.7% and had you - had we had utility costs and reimbursements at a level consistent with our expectations, our overall revenue growth would have increased from the 3.4% that was reported to about 3.6%, 3.7%.","Another factor to point out that didn\u2019t impact same-store revenue, but did impact same store expenses were property taxes. You\u2019ll likely notice that our property tax increase during the first quarter was 6%. That was largely what we expected and it\u2019s really just due to the timing of some assessments and refunds that will occur during the year and we feel confident that for the full year, real estate taxes will be about at the 4% or so level.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then that drag in the first quarter, does that - do you make that back in - for the rest of the year and coming quarters because the reason I ask is obviously your reported same store revenue growth for the quarter is below the midpoint for your full year. So it's kind of hard to see how. Maybe you could talk about some of the math behind how you can get back up to the midpoint of the range, because I think there is sort of a - there's a bit of a worry that you guys should have cut guidance and you didn\u2019t and now you're kind of in the camp of maybe, you can't make your midpoint guidance for the year. Thanks.","Paul Beldin","You bet, Nick. As we look at our expectations for the year, there are certain elements that are somewhat out of our control, such as weather and the corresponding impact on utility costs. But there's a number of factors that are within our control. One thing that you all know, but I want to emphasize is that between now and our call in July, we're going to transact about 40% of our leases for the year. And so at this point, we're about 17% of our - or so leases have transacted.","We still have a lot of wood to chop and we\u2019ll know much more in three months about where we stand. But we also have the opportunity to do better with revenue growth on items that are not related to new lease rates. And an example of that relates to our working bad debt. And over the course of the history of Aimco, we've been very focused and have done a very good job of controlling bad debt, but we think there is quite a bit of additional opportunity there. Keith, his team and others within our - in the organization are very focused on that.","We also have opportunities to do better than what we've guided to you on controllable operating expenses. And so, as we look at our guidance ranges for operations, we feel comfortable that we will land within that range that we've provided. But I\u2019d also point out that\u2019s just one factor that contributes to our bottom line results, our FFO and AFFO growth. And as we look at our redevelopment projects, the lease up of One Canal, of Indigo, we just feel really good about where those aspects of our businesses are going and we feel good about the year, look forward to the rest of it.","Nick Yulico","Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. Just one last follow-up is, you gave the weighted average rent increase, I think you said for April, a total of over 2%, you were just under 2% in the first quarter. I mean, that number I\u2019m assuming needs to go up in the next quarter or two, is that the assumption that that gets back up to 3% or so in order for you to make your guidance.","Paul Beldin","Blended lease rates do need to increase from the levels where they are now in order for us to meet our guidance ranges for the quarter. And so in real rough math, we get to the low end of our guidance ranges by having blended rate growth for the remainder of the year of a little bit below 3%. The exact percentage will really depend on how well we do in some of these other initiatives. And to get to the midpoint of our guidance range, we probably need to be closer to the 4% number. And so we know what we have to do and we're laser focused on getting it done.","Operator","The next question is from Austin Wurschmidt at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","I was just curious on the renewals, the asking rates, the 4.5% to 6.5% that you sent out for May and June. That's a fairly wide range. I was just curious if that's across the entire portfolio. Could you add a little detail there and then where do you expect those to come in on average for the final take?","Keith Kimmel","Austin, it\u2019s Keith. Thanks for the question. Those are the ranges as we look at them across the entire portfolio. And in many cases, we\u2019ll see some that will be a little bit higher than that and it really just comes down to very specific regional and property by property specifics. At the end of the day, generally what we see is about a 50 to 100 meld from the asked to ultimately take rates.","Austin Wurschmidt","So fair to say that you'd expect some acceleration from the 4.5% renewal achieved in April?","Keith Kimmel","I think that's a good assumption. As we go into peak season, very traditionally, seasonality picks up and that is how we look at it.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then, Keith, also on the occupancy that you gave for April, 95.6, how does that compare to last year?","Keith Kimmel","The occupancy, let me see if I have that number here. Let\u2019s see. And it\u2019s 50 basis points off of where we were last year at the same time and really the big driver behind that is Denver and Los Angeles. And so as we look at Denver and Los Angeles, they\u2019re about 100 basis points off of where we were from a year ago. So those are the two drivers and as we look at those two markets, we look for those to - we'll be battling through new inventory very specifically in the Mid-Wilshire part of our Los Angeles portfolio and we'll look to get better throughout the year.","Austin Wurschmidt","And that segues kind of nicely into my last one on Denver and LA. And I was just curious and I think you guys assumed a 3% to 4% growth rate in those two markets and are you still comfortable with those ranges or does some of the occupancy headwinds and supply headwinds at the higher price point concern you at this point?","Keith Kimmel","Austin, I'll tell you how we're seeing it and I\u2019ll let Paul chime in on it as well. I would say that when we look at Los Angeles very specifically, it's really a tale of two different stories. When we look at our Ventura portfolio, which is more of our B price point, we\u2019re seeing strong growth in acceleration there where occupancies are, in the first quarter, at 96.6 to give you an example and we saw north of 6% revenue growth. Really, the pressure comes in the Mid-Wilshire and really like our Palazzo communities. And so as we look at those, we're going to need to see some acceleration throughout the balance of the year and some of those headwinds are things that we're fighting for it.","Paul, what would you add?","Paul Beldin","Yeah. I would just add that with the portfolio such as ours, where we have diversification by price point and geography, it's natural for some markets to maybe underperform our expectation at the beginning of the year, but those will hopefully and likely be offset by markets that are doing better than what we had hoped for at the beginning of the year and I would tell you that, to the start of the year, Boston has done extremely well and we're pleased to have that offset. And we also see continuing strengthening in the DC area. And so there's always a balance and there\u2019s always an offset. So let's keep that in mind as you're thinking about things.","Operator","The next question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Just staying with LA, can you talk about what the impact of the decision to delay the stabilization of Palazzo At Park La Brea has on your expected return for that redevelopment?","Keith Kimmel","And Nick, what we have decided to do at Palazzo, we\u2019ve been turning and doing the construction of four at a time. And so as we have seen the absorption of the units during the first quarter, we\u2019ve just cited just to slow down the pace and so it delays the construction of the entire project by about six months, but it's not really going to impact the overall economics and I\u2019d actually tell you for the 120 or so leases that we have signed, we're well ahead of underwriting.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just, I guess on Indigo as well, you mentioned almost being fully occupied. How is the lease up on a rate basis relative to your initial expectations?","John Bezzant","Good. As you noted - this is John by the way. We're several months ahead of our pace of where we thought we would be on Indigo. At this point, it\u2019s literally crossing the 90% threshold this week and we are mid-90s on our under - versus underwriting. We've made a conscious decision last fall to accelerate pace and we took a little dip back then and our rate versus underwriting has actually been building since that point in time and we anticipate by the time we're full, we\u2019ll be up into the high-90s and chase into our underwriting very quickly next year.","Keith Kimmel","Yeah. And I would just add that as we made that decision, we looked at the expected IRR impact and decision to forego a little bit of rate to fill up the building quicker with the net benefits to our return.","Operator","The next question is from Juan Sanabria at Bank of America.","Juan Sanabria","Good morning. Just a question on LA again. The same store revenue guidance in the midpoint. Does that need a recovery in the LA market to get to that midpoint and can you talk about the cadence of supply in that market and do you expect any improvements in your growth, particular in the peak leasing season.","Paul Beldin","And Juan, this is Paul. I'd say that as we think about our revenue growth achievement for the year, it's portfolio, it's not market specific. LA is a large market for us. It is impactful, but it's just one of many factors. As we look at supply, we updated our supply expectations for the next 12 months this week based upon a new third party data and what we saw as we reviewed that information is that we have seen an uptick of supply in the Mid-Wilshire sub market of LA. And so while that was an area that we had forecasts during the 12-month period ending December 31, \u201817 of not having significant level of supply, that has now ticked up to be over 2%. And so supply is impacting us there and we saw that in our results for the quarter and we expect that LA will continue to be a slog for these A price point communities.","Juan Sanabria","And what percentage of your LA market is being hit by that exposure in terms of NOI?","Paul Beldin","It's really three properties. It's broadcast center, it's Palazzo East and it is the villas of Palazzo.","Juan Sanabria","Can I have the percentage of NOI though? Is it like 80% of your NOI in LA?","Paul Beldin","Pardon me, Juan.","Juan Sanabria","What percentage of NOI with regards to your LA portfolio do those three assets represent?","Paul Beldin","Let us follow-up with you on that. I don't have the exact breakdown at that level of detail.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And one more question for me, just, what are you guys thinking and what\u2019s the latest thought in terms of potential scope and planning over the club in Miami?","John Bezzant","Sure. Juan, this is John. We continue in an early phase view of scope and plan there. We've kind of talked a little bit about it and there have been a few press release about scope of the project there, but we're looking at a rehab of the existing building and potentially adding another tower there. If we could proceed with that project, we will do it with a development partner that's got some expertise and then high-rise construction. And I would anticipate a go-forward decision on that no sooner than probably middle of next year. We\u2019re in very early days on this.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Anderson at Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","So just I don't want to kind of wrap up on the future sort of progression of FFO. At $0.58 in the first and second quarter, if you get your guidance this quarter, you don't really get anywhere near the midpoint. I know you've talked about some of the items, but is it redevelopment ramping and bringing to market and getting NOI from that, is it the reversal of property taxes. What are the - can you kind of break out the drivers that get you to a run rate in the second half of the year that get us to that 245 type number.","Terry Considine","Yeah Rich, we\u2019ll really drive the FFO and AFFO acceleration in the second half of the year is the impact of our lease up building of One Canal and of Indigo. If you recall back, in July 1 of last year, Indigo was [indiscernible] July 1 of this year, it will be completely full. And so the impact of our lease up buildings or NOI in 2017 is about $0.13. So it's a powerful factor.","Rich Anderson","And aided a little bit by some you know claw back on the property tax line item.","Keith Kimmel","There will be some benefit in property tax and you also have the typical seasonality of expenses where the first quarter is our period where our controllable operating expenses particularly around contract maintenance for snow removal and utility cost are the highest. And so we'll see some easing of that as we always do.","Rich Anderson","And then second question, you mentioned kind of sounds like wind down of your tax credit partnership business in five years. Is that at that point where AIMCO becomes basically conventional multifamily company with a redevelopment angle, pretty beautifully boring type stuff?","Terry Considine","Actually Rich, I would say we\u2019re there today because what we're doing with that asset management business is that we are earning a fee stream and that fee stream is fairly certain because of where we are in the lifecycle of those partnerships. And so while there will be some earnings contribution to those fees that will diminish over the next five or six years, our business is truly the operation of real estate and that's where we are laser focused.","Rich Anderson","Right so, but there will be a need to replace those income streams. How do you respond to that? How do you how do you replace that?","Terry Considine","Oh sure and as we look at that and even look at it from two perspectives, starting with net asset value. The IRR on that fee stream is about 7% and so if you think about our redevelopment activities where we typically do IRRs of 9% plus mostly in excess of 10% it will be very accretive from the NAV line. Now what there might be is some AFFO and FFO dilution as these partnerships are wound down and our investment options might take a period of time to ramp up. But as we look out the dilution, there's two elements of earning solution.","The first is in our deferred tax, second the deferred tax credit income, which we have long scheduled out for everyone in our supplemental schedules. And then the second is the reduction and fees earned from the operations of the properties, those underlying partnerships are slowly liquidated. And we don't really see much of any impact of dilution from that piece of it until about the 2021 period. And at that point in time we'll have dilution of call it $0.04 or $0.05 or less per year. And so looking at that today that's about less than 2.5% of FFO, but as we expect FFO to continue to grow and to expand, it will become even less of a factor, so we...","Operator","The next question is from John Kim at BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Your percentage of As in your portfolio have gone up from 43% a couple years ago to 51% today and given the outperformance of Bs and supply coming online over the next couple of years, do you sense that you want to have a better balance between As and Bs going forward?","Terry Considine","John, it's Terry, we\u2019re happy with something in the neighborhood of 50\/50. There will be different times in the cycle when a change in that mix might favor one or the other. But that rough proportionality balances the defensiveness of the Bs and the income growth that's possible inside the As.","John Kim","50\/50 and then no Cs is the correct?","Terry Considine","C pluses we have are basically in high rent markets, so their rents are quite comparable to the Bs.","John Kim","The weakness you\u2019re seeing in LA is that supply pressure coming just specifically from the Mid-Wilshire sub market or you\u2019re also finding that downtown is having a bigger impact than previously expected.","Keith Kimmel","John, it\u2019s Keith. There's no question that inventory that\u2019s down in the Staple Center is impactful. It's more of a trickledown effect as people move within the different neighborhoods whether it's in Hancock Park or North Hollywood. What\u2019s of interest is that when we really look at it, it's our entry level one bedrooms and two bedrooms those price points that ease the pressure.","John Kim","And then just a question on the Airbnb and now that the lawsuit has been public, any update on that and any impact on revenues pushing back on your restrictiveness policy?","Lisa Cohn","This is Lisa, thanks for the question. In terms of the litigation it's early days and since you asked the question I'll just add a little commentary around our views on it. We've been really pleased with the positive response that we have received from so many apartment owners who like us object to Airbnb\u2019s trespass on private property rights and that is they should not be permitted to profit by using property without the property owner's consent. And even more we're gratified by the positive response that we've had from our residents.","You've heard us say many times before the most important job we do is pick your neighbor. And to that end we screened potential residents on credit, we screen them on criminal background checks, and we hold our residents accountable for being good neighbors. And Airbnb circumvents that and puts our neighbors - puts our residents at unnecessary risk and so that's simply unacceptable to us. From a revenue standpoint I\u2019ll let Keith or Paul dive into that, but it's a really small percentage of our portfolio at any one time but from a philosophical standpoint incredibly important to us.","Keith Kimmel","John, this is Keith, as we think about it's you know typically maybe a couple hundred units, 200 units or so at any given time that we've been navigating with this Airbnb issue.","John Kim","[indiscernible] any other REITs that are going to join you as far as their stance against Airbnb?","Lisa Cohn","It's hard to say, people are cheering us on, but we'll see what makes the most sense as we proceed through this.","Operator","The next question it from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","So on the revenue growth assumptions, Paul, you mentioned that what you guys have to do to hit the midpoint, but it seems like what you have to do to is hit the high end as pretty aggressive especially given the trends that you've already disclosed for April. Do you see the high end as a realistic possibility?","Terry Considine","We said guidance for the year is going to be a year of uncertain and as well we provided a wider than typical range. And I would agree that based on what we know today, the high new guidance looks to be challenging but the environment could change as we progress through the remainder of the year.","Conor Wagner","And then, John, on the Calhoun redevelopment, just on my simple math it looks like you're getting a 5.5% yield on the increased rents versus the costs there and that's assuming hundred percent contribution from the rents. Is that fair is there something I'm missing and then given that level of return what was your decision for making process there versus selling the asset or do something - doing something else with it.","John Bezzant","I mean, to tell you, we\u2019re in early phase, this is early phase of the project, but I\u2019m going to hand it over to Patti Fielding to give you some of the detail around the underwriting and the future phases.","Patti Fielding","Hi, its\u2019 Patty, thanks for the question. When you think about Calhoun you've got to realize that it\u2019s a multi phased redevelopment project. And we are in the planning process on phase 2 to Phase 3. We believe that we've got an ability to increase the yields overall. While we made the decision to proceed, we consider the IRR which is north of 10% overall on the entire project. As far as yields on the rocks on the pipeline and the portfolio as a whole for redeployment opportunities we're very comfortable that everything we're looking at is north of 6% overall.","Conor Wagner","So the 10% IIR is based on completing all three phases at Calhoun?","Patti Fielding","It is, it should be north on all three phases at Calhoun. And so we\u2019ve got to look at it holistically. I mean when you look at the project this is a really unique and special piece of dirt in our portfolio. And Calhoun is like nothing else in the Minneapolis market, it\u2019s surrounded by multi-million dollar single-family homes across the Lake Calhoun. This submarket benefits from highly educated workforce. This is 16% Fortune 500 Companies that are there. Their headquarters are there including the United Health Care targeted by CMC a very, very strong market. The property itself contains 333 units that\u2019s highlighted on the schedule.","The first phase does not historic portion of the development which is a 12 story tower that was built in 1998, 275 units. Phase 2 and phase 3 is comprised of the 57 unit vintage building that's nine stories high. And the two towers are joined in the middle by a four story parking garage at about 38,000 square feet of commercial unretail space. We can't replicate this location and we can\u2019t be the history and the nostalgia of this building and its position in the market is second to none. It's an invaluable piece of real estate. And so we have to look at it holistically asks what the long term positioning and value play is on this property and we're in it for the long haul, where this is a lot term hold ad this is a very long-term stable market that this property is in.","Terry Considine","Hey Conor, I\u2019d remind you too and these multi-phased projects, we do like this, like Park Towne, like Sterling. Often times the first phase we've got some heavy lifting around some core in the building just maybe a little bit of deferred opportunity to catch the building up. And so of the heavy lifting in the first phase and some of the gravy is in the later phases.","Conor Wagner","And so then what is the total expected cost for all three phases.","Patti Fielding","We're not at this we are ready to discuss that as we get phase 2 and phase 3 through investment committee will be in a position to give you the details on that.","Conor Wagner","When you say investment committee, it sounds like you've already decided to do it or that the only reason you do phase one is because of the gravy that John just mentioned on phases two and three. So it seems like the whole thing has already been spoken for. So I'm just trying to understand that one just understand the cost so we can understand the full scope. But then two, part of the focus on the redevelopment program has been to do it more incrementally so that you know things aren't working out you can pull back quickly or you can be a bit more nimble but as you're describing this project it seems like well it's going to be done in phases. it really only makes sense financially to do the entire scope of work done.","Terry Considine","Conor, this is Jerry and he think you make it very good point that if we if we stop on phase one the returns will be accretive but not extraordinary. We haven't finished our work in two and three we expected that we will finish it we can see what's coming. And I think you\u2019ll be satisfied but it's not your exactly right this was about sticking so it's.","Q - Conor Wagner","Just ballpark then is it like at all in 100 million type project or can you give us a range.","Terry Considine","Let's talk about it maybe in June when we're together.","Operator","The next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Just a quick one can we guidance differently Paul, you kind of reiterated guidance you\u2019re bottom line is kind of the same you're fundamentals you're expecting to get back to the midpoint you know you mention G&A and interest expense for you know favorable to expectations in the quarter I mean do you see that playing out for the rest of the year is there anything driving that were there anything else in you know kind of driving guidance pretty same there.","Terry Considine","Hi, Michael, thanks for asking about interest expense in particular we were slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter for interest expense and we actually think that's going to carry forward as we progress throughout the remainder of the year. A part of that is that the as we set our expectations for interest rates on our ten year financing that we're going to do the ten-year treasury has dropped a little bit since that time who knows where it's going to go in the future is there's some risk to that but looking at it today we see opportunity.","And then another factor impacting interest rates is a decision that we have a couple maturities that are upcoming in the second and third quarter. Where we're just going to take advantage of the arbitrage between floating and fixed rates and carry some of those materials on our line balance for a period of three to six months and get a little bit of a pickup out of that. G&A cost, we were a little bit lower than expected in the first quarter but as we look at the full year the range of G&A cost that we provided in connection with our guidance January so looks to be on track.","Unidentified Analyst","Great that's really helpful and then just I get from a bit more generally. You know we talked a lot about L.A. So how I passed on that one but any supply in other markets that they are coming in more favorable or less favorable to where you thought Is there anything you guys are getting it bleed out to later in the year any delivery delays there or anything like that.","Terry Considine","I talked about the deliveries that we have seen versus what third parties were forecasting for our markets and Keith may add some extra color. There what we had expected as we've spoken in January was there to be about 7000 deliveries in our high impacts sub markets during the first quarter. We actually only received a little over 4300 of those. And so there has been some delay but the areas where the units were delivered were in some of the more impacted markets we've talked about Denver but another market that's impacted is Inner City Philadelphia we did see a fair number of deliveries there. And so as we look forward on a twelve month basis in our supply outlook has improved slightly in Philadelphia, it's improved slightly and down and the tail which comes as our Indigo property is improved in Atlanta, Buckhead and Midtown and also improves lightly in downtown Denver although we expect downtown Denver to continue to be a challenge. Keith you have any other color.","Keith Kimmel","Michael I just what I would add to it is just maybe just think back to some of the conversations we had about Washington DC a couple years back. When we look at this quarter we're almost a full percentage point more occupied in the first quarter of \u201817 compared to \u201816 in Washington DC and so very much like you see cyclical process of different markets doing different things. We're starting to see some more acceleration in Washington D.C. as we compared over year over year.","Operator","The next question is from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. Following on the last question about debt maturities, you mentioned second quarter and third quarter debt maturities being able to hold out on the line for a while a bigger slope coming in 4Q is there any ability to prepay that you're looking at carrying out a rate above 6, of I think that's something you're opening up pretty hard.","Terry Considine","Yeah but we not only evaluate the ability to retain any depositions that are upcoming injuring seventeen we're also looking very hard at our opportunities \u201818; \u201819 and \u201820. So we're having conversations with folks, we\u2019re dealing with any potential modification and as we have real news to report we\u2019ll share it you.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay is any of that assumed in guidance the [indiscernible]?","Terry Considine","No, it\u2019s not.","Unidentified Analyst","And one question just on the markets where you are facing the supply of LA, Denver, Philadelphia has anything surprised you on the demand front the compound of that issue or is there anything about the nature of the supply that has been a surprise in terms of timing.","Keith Kimmel","Drew, this is Keith. I\u2019ll jump in I would say that the source of demand is concerned we see you sufficient demand to meet our needs it's just you know there's definitely been some more pressure as far as how it's being absorbed and that's pretty atypical when you think about new inventory being coming into a marketplace.","Unidentified Analyst","So as you head into the spring and summer, are you planning on holding pricing or is there kind of a decisive move being made to manage for occupancy as long as new lease spreads are negative.","Keith Kimmel","Drew, we make that decision truly building by building and so you know some buildings will be more defensive and really making sure we're retaining our residence if we're seeing more front door pressure and others we start seeing some acceleration easing and when we get more aggressive. o those decisions are made literally building by building.","Operator","The next question is from Buck Horne at Raymond James Financial.","Buck Horne","Just a quick one from me, just with shares trading at a pretty wide discount to your internal view of NAV just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on potential stock repurchases at the levels or what up potentially think of exhilarating asset dispositions or any other activities.","Terry Considine","Buck, it\u2019s Terry, and as you know, we guided as a tool and our tool kits and we look at it and we evaluate it compared to other options. We think we still have better returns in Patti\u2019s business and redevelopment. But you're right it's very price sensitive and we'll keep a look at it.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Considine for closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you all for your interest in AIMCO, we appreciate your following. If you have any questions please call Paul Beldin our Chief Financial Officer or Lynn Stanfield our Senior Vice President in charge of investor relations or me. And we will try and give you a straight answer and we wish you all the best and look forward to seeing many of you in June. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Cohn","Thank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2018 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.","We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website."," Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Aimco enjoyed a solid first quarter. In property operations, revenue was up. Same-store occupancy was the best first quarter result in the past 7 years.","Blended rent increases were 2.7%, up 60 basis points year-over-year and this positive trend continues in April. In redevelopment and development, projects are on time, on budget and are creating value.","In portfolio management, we improved our portfolio with pair trades for two selected acquisitions where even in a fully priced market, Aimco's operational expertise can produce significant value creation and we funded both with well executed sales so that's the pair trade increased expected free cash flow internal rate of return by 400 basis points.","In February, we purchased Bent Tree Apartments, a community located close to two Aimco communities in West Fairfax County, all three built by the same developer in the late 1980s. We know the market, we know the buildings and we know exactly what to do to increase Bent Tree's profitability.","Later in April, we announced the partnership with, a prominent Philadelphia developer who contributed to Aimco's portfolio of six-A quality apartment communities in the Philadelphia market, mainly in Center City, and University City.","We are pleased to welcome Carl as a partner, and we're gratified that his confidence at Aimco resulted in him becoming a top 20 investor by taking $90 million of OP units valued at $53 per share, consistent with Aimco's published net asset value.","Later in Aimco -- later in April, we agreed to sell our asset management portfolio and four remaining affordable communities, completing our methodical multiyear exit from this line of business.","In doing so at a price of $126 million in excess of our published net asset value. These transactions and indeed, all the good work at Aimco are due to a hard-working team energized and shaped by Aimco's intentional culture of respect and collaboration, customer focus and responsibility for results.","I'm grateful and humbled that Aimco was recognized in April as a top workplace in Colorado for a sixth consecutive year, a record of long-term excellent shared with only seven other companies across our entire state. For these successes and all their hard work, I offer sincere thanks to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver and across the country.","Now for a more detailed report on the first quarter, I'll turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith Kimmel","Thanks Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid first quarter in operations. The same-store revenues up 2.6%, expenses up 2.1% and net operating income up 2.7%. We had strong average daily occupancy of 96.3% for the quarter, 30 basis points better than the first quarter of 2017.","We continue to provide exceptional customer service. Residents gave us better than four stars for the 18th consecutive quarter with 4.26 out five stars. Our high customer satisfaction limited our turnover to 45.8% for the quarter, 470 basis points better than the first quarter of 2017. Lower turnover continues to be a key contributor to our operational efficiencies and expense results.","Looking at leases, which transacted in the quarter, same-store blended lease rates were up 2.7%, with renewal rents having solid increases of 4.9% and new leases up 40 basis points.","We saw new lease rates of 46% in Miami, Los Angeles, and San Diego. These are some of our most important markets, which account for about a quarter of our same-store NOI. We had the most pressure on new lease rates in Seattle, Nashville, and Baltimore. These less impactful markets only represent 4% of same-store NOI.","Turning to the first quarter same-store revenue growth. Our top performers had revenue increases over 3% for the quarter. This includes Miami, the Bay Area, San Diego, and Denver. Strong performers, which had revenue growth over 2% were Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle.","With revenue growth of flat to 1%, we had Washington, D.C. and New York, and finally, revenue was down in Atlanta and Philadelphia. As a reminder, our Philadelphia same-store portfolio is two communities and does not include our premier redevelopment properties. Those Philadelphia redevelopments, along with our substantial portfolio outside of same-store have started off strong in 2018.","The sterling is now 96% occupied. The first three towers of Park Towne are about 90% occupied and while construction of the fourth and final tower is not slated to be finished until September, as of today, we're about 35% preleased and our first move-ins occurred in late April.","We are confident in the Philadelphia market. Having a total lease over 1,100 units at the Center City communities at rents in line with our underwriting. At Saybrook in San Jose, we've leased 267 of the 269 completed units at rents above plan. Across all of our redevelopment and development properties, 95% of our 2,800 renovated homes are currently occupied with rental rates in line with our projections.","Turning to our new acquisitions, we are encouraged by the early results where we have applied our operational expertise. Bent Tree is currently 96.5% occupied, up from 94% on day one with solid new lease rates all of which exceed our underwriting.","And we've hit the ground running with our four new communities in Philadelphia. Our first few days have gone according to plan and we thank our team for their execution during this transition.","As we look at our as same-store April results, we see solid start to the second quarter with a continuation of our strong average daily occupancy and a strengthening of new lease rates.","Our average daily occupancy for April was 96.4%, some 80 basis points higher than 2017. Blended lease rates were up 2.6%, with renewals up 4.7% and new leases up 70 basis points. April marks the fourth consecutive month of accelerating new lease rates, a trend we expect to continue in May as well","Finally, May and June renewal offers went out with 4% to 6% increases. And with great thanks to our teams in the field and here in Denver for your commitment to Aimco's success.","I'll turn the call over to John Bezzant, our Chief Investment Officer. John?","John Bezzant","Thank you, Keith. As Terry discussed, we identified and executed on a few unique transactions in recent months that are indicative of our pair trade philosophy and our eye for opportunistic investing.","In February, Aimco closed on the purchase of Bent Tree apartments in Fairfax County, Virginia, just a few miles Southeast of Dallas airport for $160 million. Keith mentioned this team's progress increasing rent since acquisition, but the ability to raise rents is only part of the story. Bent Tree presented an opportunity for us to take advantage of Aimco's specific knowledge to execute a trade we believe will outperform the market in general.","Specifically, we saw opportunities in the following areas, the market. As Terry noted, Aimco operates two very similar properties, located five and 10 miles from Bent Tree, Shenandoah Crossing and Berkshire Commons.","The building, these other two properties were built by the same developer that built Bent Tree. We've taken both of those communities through various capital enhancements in recent years and understand clearly where the market demand is and what it will pay.","The team, we promoted a new manager to Bent Tree from Berkshire Commons. She knows the market, knows the property and has quickly set about implementing the Aimco management plan. And finally, the system. Aimco's ability to operate efficiently provides us an opportunity to outperform prior operations and the market.","We found a similar opportunity when we announced in mid-April that we had entered an agreement to acquire a portfolio of six communities in Philadelphia. These communities, three of which are best-of-class renovations of the storage structures and three of which are new construction, fits seamlessly in Aimco's Philadelphia portfolio, with the Center City and University City focus that complements our existing properties and bring a world-class team of local knowledge that will build upon our strength. We closed on the acquisition of initial four communities on May 1st.","Our East Coast acquisitions team led by Wes Powell and Matt Conrad, has done a great job of identifying, securing and closing on the unique opportunities. And our East Coast operations team, led by Kevin Mosher, [Indiscernible], and Jason Kessler, and assisted by many others has done a great job of integrating them into the Aimco family and performing from day one.","Aimco will sell Chestnut Hill Village, an older community in north suburban Philadelphia, as part of its pair trade for this transaction and as another step in our continued reallocation of capital from weaker submarkets to stronger.","Upon completion of the transaction, Aimco's allocation to Philadelphia will increase from 8% to 10% of gross asset value with more of that allocation invested in submarkets with higher rents, higher free cash flow margins, greater potential for revenue growth in Center City and University City continued their emergence as thriving residential and professional communities.","With the implementation of Aimco's operating platform, we anticipate this portfolio will generate a year one net operating income yield of 5.3% for the five operating properties. And when adding in the development community to be completed early next year, we'll have average rents of approximately $2,200 per apartment home and a 10-year expected free cash flow internal rate of return of about 8%.","Now I'd like to remind those of you who missed our Investor Day in Philadelphia a few years ago, what it is that drives us to this market and specifically, to the Center City and University City submarkets. First and foremost, as Keith noted, we have seen strong demand for our redeveloped apartment homes at The Sterling and Park Towne Place over the last few years. They have leased up well and had underwriting, even if supplies crept into the market. We believe that demand is driven by are our resurgence of downtown Philadelphia that is largely supported by its high levels of educational attainment and strong job growth and relation to new multifamily supply.","Based on data from Green Street and MPF Research, Philadelphia's ratio of 9.9 new jobs for every new unit of multifamily supply ranks in the top tier nationally. It is third highest among the top 50 largest multifamily markets, behind Sacramento and the inland, California.","And that 9.9 ratio is nearly double the five to one ratio, we believe drives equilibrium in the market. Much of this job growth is driven by companies looking to tap Philadelphia's highly educated workforce where in Center City, 84% of 25 to 34 year olds have a bachelor's degree or higher. This is a number virtually identical to Palo Alto and Cambridge.","And finally, since 2002, according to REIS, Center City's compound annual rate of rent growth of approximately 3.3% lags only Seattle and the Bay Area amongst Aimco's target markets. And that growth was delivered with much less volatility. I'll spend a minute on the sale of our Asset Management business and the remaining affordable properties.","In late April, we announced an agreement to sell our asset management portfolio and $4 Affordable real estate communities to related for $590 million. This binding agreement was a substantial deposit in place, is the capstone to a multiyear strategy, first announced in 2011 of exiting our affordable business and concentrating our capital investment in the market REIT communities.","This business has been an integral part of the Aimco family for many years and we appreciate the contributions of hundreds of teammates across the country that have helped make it successful. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter of this year.","And not to be entirely over by our transaction activity as Keith reported, our redevelopment projects are doing well and remain on track in terms of lease-up and construction pace.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?","Paul Beldin","Thanks John. I'd like to cover today a number of subjects starting with our financial results for the first quarter. AFFO per share of $0.54 was up 6% year-over-year and $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of guidance.","One $0.01 of outperformance is due to stronger than guided profit operations, including a benefit from Bent Tree, which we own for about half of the quarter. The other $0.01 is due to the timing of capital replacement spending.","Our balance sheet remains safe, liquid, and strong. We have limited refunding risk, less than 1% of our property debt matures during the balance of this year. The weighted average maturity of our leverage is 8.7 years, up slightly from year end.","We are liquid with abundant capacity, more than $0.5 billion available on our revolving credit facility and $2 billion in our unencumbered properties available as dry powder to support additional borrowings. We have limited entity risk because we continue to use primarily long-term fixed rate non-recourse property debt.","During the quarter, we closed $242 million of fixed-rate senior loans at a weighted average interest rate of 3.48%, lowering the weighted average interest rate of our total fixed rate debt by almost 10 basis points to 4.55% and reducing annual interest expense by more than $3 million.","We also placed $119 million of five-year floating-rate property loans with interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 125 bps, an all-in rate today of 3.17%. The five-year term fills a hole in our maturity ladder, and after the expected repayment of our term borrowing, reduces our exposure to floating interest rates to less than 7% of total leverage.","Next, I'd like to cover the financial highlights of our year-to-date transaction activities. Our investment discipline is to fund these acquisitions by paired trades. Proceeds from the sale of asset management portfolio, the remaining four affordable communities and Chestnut Hill Village will complete the funding for the Bent Tree and Philadelphia acquisitions, funds 2018 redevelopment activities, reduce leverage by two-tenths of a turn, and fund redemption of our Class A preferred stock when it is callable in the second quarter next year.","Taken together, the properties purchased by Aimco have a free cash flow, internal rate of return, 400 basis points higher than we expect from the assets sold to fund the purchases."," While the trade will be mildly dilutive to AFFO for the next couple of years, it redeploys the value of the depleting cash flows of our asset management business into high quality operating communities with durable cash flows and promising future growth. This trade is a good example of our choosing long-term value-creation and free cash flow growth, even if there is some reduction in short-term earnings.","Now turning to full year 2018 guidance, as updated in last night's release. Notwithstanding our first quarter beat and good momentum entering the second quarter, we made no change to Aimco's same-store revenue, expense, and NOI guidance. It is still early in the year and we will take another look after the second quarter. Given the pending sale of the asset management business, we lowered guidance from $36 million for the year to $22 million to $24 million, assuming the sale closes sometime in the third quarter. We lowered pro forma FFO and AFFO per share by $0.03 of the midpoint to take into account first quarter results and the impact of our transactional activities.","Now, I'd like to point out our annual enhancements to our supplemental schedules. We now present property revenue, exclusive of resident utility reimbursements and expenses net of such reimbursements. We believe this presentation results in a clearer view of underlying revenue and expense growth rates. This change was contemplated when we set full year guidance and is expected to decrease full year same-store revenue growth by seven basis points.","For the first quarter, the impact was a 30 basis point reduction in same-store revenue growth. We also adjusted how we present Aimco proportionate share. Schedule 2A now reflects Aimco's consolidated results, while Schedule 2B shows the amount of consolidated AFFO attributable to third-parties as well as Aimco's share of AFFO from unconsolidated investments.","Schedule 10 has been slightly revised to present more clearly our redevelopment and development activities and the value of these activities create for Aimco. Last, given investor interest, we added a schedule to highlight some of what makes Philadelphia an attractive place to invest and helpful to diversify the Aimco portfolio.","We would also like to invite all of you to tour our communities in Philadelphia and experience firsthand what we find so exciting. Several tours are in the process being scheduled for the summer, but should those dates not work, please reach out to me, Lynn or Susie, and we will accommodate you.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two for the time in the queue. Laura, I'll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And our first question will come from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi good morning out there. So, last quarter, you guys talked about the midpoint of revenue growth was comprised of an increase in average daily occupancy of 10 basis points and blended lease rate, growth of about 2.5%. You achieved better results in the first quarter with occupancy of 30 bps, blended lease rate growth was 2.7%.","And those trends continued, if not improved, a bit into April, particularly on the occupancy side. So just curious if you expect that to trend lower through the balance of the year? Or if you're just being a little bit conservative as it remains early in the year.","Paul Beldin","Austin, thank you for your question. This is Paul. And you recapped the fact exactly right. We're off to a great start to the year, but it is 25% of our business. So we like what we have achieved so far, but we have the other 75% of our leases yet to transact, and we look forward to reporting our progress as we proceed through peak leasing. ","Austin Wurschmidt","And then, so when you look at the supply picture quarter-by-quarter, do you expect that to ramp, remain fairly steady or decrease as the year progresses? And then what's kind of the early expectation as you look into 2019 versus 2018 supply?","Paul Beldin","Austin, this is Paul and then I'll turn it over if anybody else wants to add some additional color. I think we collectively all have learned predicting supply is somewhat challenging, particularly when you talk about it on a quarterly basis. What we see in our submarkets is that, that supply in aggregate is expected to be delivered at a fairly ratable pace throughout 2018, that's always subject to change.","We'll see what actually happens, but that's what the third-party forecasters are currently projecting. And I just like to remind everybody, as we think about supply, we look at it when supply is meaningful, and in our definition, that is supply as a percentage of existing stock of greater than 2% and that supply is being delivered into a submarket where Aimco has price-point communities.","And so as we look at supply in that lens, we have roughly about 20% of our gross asset value that would meet that criteria, and that's actually a fairly similar, if not maybe down slightly, from where we were in the end of the fourth quarter.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for taking the questions Paul.","Operator","And the next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Terry, you spent a bunch of time talking about Dranoff took equity at $53 a share on an OP basis, but I wonder if you can just step back, and even at current pricing, it's about 20, 25 basis points on the total deal yield. It's only 15% to 20% of the total, taking out 80%, 85% in cash, its tax, right?","So, if it's in a long-dated piece of equity for him, it almost doesn't matter where the stock price is or what the unit is because his basis is what it contributed to the assets. I guess, why focus so much on something that's arguably somewhat not material in nature to the overall transaction? ","Terry Considine","Thank you, Michael. I think it's one of the things we appreciate and the relative weight to it is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, but I'm very grateful for Carl's place in what we're doing. I think he'll be a great partner and help us in our work going forward.","Michael Bilerman","But that really isn't -- I mean, the reality is it's not a big part of the proceeds that he's taken, right? The majority of proceeds is cash. He's taking units to protect his tax basis. The $53 in the fictional number because his basis is the assets he's selling.","And if you just took it at the current stock price, it's only 25 basis points on the transaction from an exit perspective. So, I'm just -- I know why you want the headline, but I think it's a little bit misleading.","Terry Considine","It's a free country, you're entitled to your opinion, Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Well, how about we ask this from the other perspectives. If the NAV is at $53, you sold the related assets at a premium to what you disclosed the NAV, why not buy your stock in the low 40s at north of the six and five cap rate then roll in proceeds at market into assets?","Terry Considine","You ask this question each quarter and I think it's a good one. And it's something that we think about, we keep in our toolkit. You know that we've made stock buybacks in scale at previous times and we may yet again, but we haven't done it this quarter. ","Michael Bilerman","But in the context of spending $450 million, right? The majority of $350 million of which is in cash, either taking debt or using your line of credit, if you truly believe in the NAV, which was certainly justified by the related transaction at a premium to what you put into those numbers, why not use any capacity you have to buy back your script, rather than buying assets at market?","Terry Considine","It's a very good question. As I've said, it's something we think about, something we've done in the past and we may do in the future, but we didn't do this quarter.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [Indiscernible] with Juan Sanabria. So a question on your disposition, when you say cap rates on affordable units and also the asset management business, how do you guys value that? ","John Bezzant","So, I'll give you just kind of rough guidelines. So on the asset management business, it is a little tough to apply a cap rate to it per se because this is a fee-based business. We were not selling underlying real estate, so that's really not the way we looked at it from a value perspective.","We look at it as a valuation of the fee and income stream associated with that over the runoff of the business. And effectively, we kind of put it into an IRR-based model that they ended up in the fours. The Hunters Pointe communities were real estate transactions, and those are four caps. Those are mid fours on a cap rate basis.","Paul Beldin","And Shirley, just to clarify what John said, the free cash flow internal rate of return that he quoted in the fours, it's 4.4% and that's actually the combined free cash flow IRR for the fee stream that John described and the four affordable communities in Hunters Point of San Francisco.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. So, I guess, in addition, you guys flip side, acquisition in Fairfax and also Philly, any other place that you're looking at for opportunity?","Keith Kimmel","Well, in terms of other opportunities, we continue to look all over the country on a regular basis as we've kind of highlighted here this quarter. When we do make a trade, we are making a trade on paired trade basis where we think we can trade out of assets that have a lower long-term value to the portfolio than what we're buying, and we measure that via free cash flow internal rate of return.","We have an ongoing pipeline of opportunities that we look at. If you look back to last year, we didn't buy anything. This year, we've done a couple of deals, and I think as we look forward, I would expect we will do very selective deals when we see an opportunity. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Operator","And next we have a question from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","First question just has to do with the Philly increased exposure. Was that driven by your interest in expanding in Philly because of some of the metrics that you had mentioned, the City Center area in particular? Or was it more the opportunity came to you and it's sort of met an area that you are perhaps somewhat interested in?","John Bezzant","I think it's a little bit of both. I think that as we look at opportunities, kind of following up on the prior question, when we see things come across, we look at it in relation to the submarket specifically where the property is located. We look at it and how that submarket fits within our portfolio.","What we have within our portfolio that we could trade out of, that would be an accretive, better trade to come out and go into the new opportunity and so we certainly saw that in Philadelphia. This was not a portfolio that was on the market.","This was an opportunity that we had to approach a local owner, developer who had a very high quality portfolio in submarkets that we frankly are quite attracted to and we thought it was a good fit for our portfolio, and Weston and his team was able to put together the deal.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then on the operational side, I think you talked about blended rent rates in April were 2.6%, could you tell us what that is versus a year ago?","Paul Beldin","Yes. Dennis, this is Paul. I believe blended lease rate for this portfolio a year ago we're up about 2.2%. ","Dennis McGill","Okay. And if you think about how that's trended so far this year, it's basically been 2.6% or 2.7% each month, but you would think normally there'd be some seasonal lift. Is there something that's preventing that seasonal lift? Or how are you guys thinking about the normal seasonality versus what you're seeing so far this year? ","Keith Kimmel","Dennis, this is Keith. We basically produced on our plan to this point when we get into May, June and through August, in our peak season. That is when demand typically accelerates and we see a lift. Its early days, and we will wait and see exactly how that happens, but we're optimistic about our positioning being highly occupied and having strong rates at this point going into peak season.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Drew Babin of Baird.","Andrew Babin","Thanks for taking my question. Quick question on Miami. Obviously, quite a sequential pickup in occupancy, and I think up 130 basis points or so and good pricing. I was just curious kind of what specifically is happening in Miami? Is it supply burning off? Is it something on the demand side? Any color there will help.","Keith Kimmel","Drew, it's Keith. I'll walk you through the Miami piece. So, in Brickell, we have a very specific building, a Yacht Club that has a lease-up that's going to be happening across the street that's panorama. This particular building, we had anticipated moving, that will start happening in the fourth quarter. It's been a little delayed in their deliveries, so we've had a little stronger occupancy there going into the first quarter.","And then the balance of our portfolio also has performed a little stronger than we had anticipated. So, I'd say a bit of it is timing on some supply, specifically in Brickell and the rest of it is doing a little better than we thought.","Andrew Babin","Okay, that's helpful. And then, quickly on Philadelphia, are you assuming anything specifically? Or can you point to anything specifically in your demand forecast regarding the Comcast Technology Center opening by the end of this year? Obviously, very proximate to The Sterling and then some other assets, but I guess what types of jobs might that bring in? Is that something that's kind of critical to your decision to up weight Philadelphia?","John Bezzant","Thank you for the question. This is John. That Comcast Innovation Center is literally across the alley from The Sterling building that we completed the redevelopment on. You heard Keith say earlier, it's over 96% occupied today. We anticipate that that building will do nothing but good for The Sterling. For Park Towne, that's about less than half a mile away from it and the Dranoff buildings there are also within 0.5 to 0.75 of a mile.","And so as we look forward, yes, we see a lot of good things happening, not just with Comcast, but with other companies in the area. We've got Vanguard that's bringing some of their operations downtown in the next couple of years.","And just the dynamic in Philadelphia. We were there last week with our Board, did a walking tour. We were walking around the streets and there is an element of dynamism, and I realized there are Philadelphia doubters out there, and I candidly have been one of them over time.","And you get out and you walk the streets, and there's a different feel in that town right now than there was five years ago and that's really what we're looking forward to and that's what we're looking to leverage.","Andrew Babin","Great. Thanks for that. And then one question for Paul and the balance sheet. 2019 debt maturities, I assume some of that is pre-payable this year at some point, is there anything in your guidance specifically regarding refinancing of that debt or otherwise paying it down?","Paul Beldin","Yes, Drew, thank you for the question. You're right. We have about 25% of our 2019 maturities is pre-payable at par, starting in the fourth quarter. We have started discussions with our lenders on that debt and so the potential benefit from refinancing that, that at today's rates was contemplated in our guidance and we're working to achieve that.","Andrew Babin","All right, great. That's all for me. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our next question will come from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Terry, my first question is on the portfolio footprint as it sits today. First is your peers. You have the fewest amount of units broadly and spread across the most markets, so that was clearly your G&A is higher than most of your peers as a percent of assets. Why does it make sense to operate such disparate footprint? And are exit markets being actively considered internally?","Terry Considine","John, first of all, thank you very much, and I'm confident that you'll have an opinion about Philadelphia as a hometown boy and maybe you can reassure others on the call, that we do look at markets of changing our weighting and other markets where we'd like to increase our weighting.","And it's really driven more by investment opportunities than it is by G&A. Our G&A as a percentage of revenue or GADs right in the middle of the pack, and we want to be careful and frugal about it so -- but the main investment issue is where we can put capital and have the highest risk-adjusted returns.","John Pawlowski","Are you exploring any exit markets right now actively?","Terry Considine","As John mentioned, we look regularly across the country at lots and lots of deals, but we do very few because we look for ones that have sort of much higher returns than the properties would sell to fund them. For example, most recently, the spread between buying and selling in the paired trade that Paul described is 400 basis points.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And last one for me. Terry, when the Board asks you going forward, what are you and the team going to do differently to close the valuation gap than you've done in the past couple of years? What do you say?","Terry Considine","Well, of course, what goes on at the Board meeting, goes on in the Board meeting, wouldn't necessarily be what -- wouldn't want to report here on the call. But broadly, I think they think as our shareholders do, that we should focus on our business and increasing net asset value and that over time, this will be reflected in the market.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","So, thank you, and thank you all on the call for your interest. I reiterate Paul's invitation to tour Bent Tree or Philadelphia, and I look forward to seeing many of you in a month's time at NAREIT. Thanks again.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"1977":["Apartment Investment & Management (NYSE:AIV) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  3, 2012  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Lisa R.

[Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Ms. Cohn, you may begin. Ms. Cohn, you may begin the conference.","[Technical Difficulty]","Lisa R. Cohn","Good day, everyone, and apologies for the delay in starting the call.","During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgments, including projections related to 2012 results. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which may be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.","The participants on today's call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide opening remarks; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO, will review second quarter results and 2012 guidance. Also in the room today are John Bezzant, Executive Vice President, Transactions; Miles Cortez, EVP and Chief Administrative Officer; and Dan Matula, EVP of Redevelopment and Construction Services. We are available to answer questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?","Terry Considine","Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. Business is good. During the recently completed second quarter, Aimco continued on plan. During the second quarter, we earned FFO of $0.46 per share. That's up 10% year-over-year. And we earned AFFO of $0.34 per share, that's up 17% year-over-year.","The operating team led by Keith maintained high occupancy while increasing rents, with new and renewal rents averaging 5% higher than rents on expiring leases.","The 12-month leases, the hard work of Keith and his team, locks in today a revenue base supporting the growth we expect over the next year. Keith's team also excelled in cost discipline, particularly in the area of labor utilization, as you can see in the 8% year-over-year decline in payroll costs. Importantly, we maintained a healthy level of capital investment and maintenance spending. Our properties are in good condition, as you can see from the rising rents they command. Our portfolio gets better and better. Its average revenue per unit was about $1,300 in the second quarter. This important measure of portfolio quality determined and paid by customers was up about 8% year-over-year, about 1\/2 due to rent growth and 1\/2 due to acquisition and redevelopment of higher rent properties funded by the sale of lower rated properties. Cash from the sale of lower rated properties was used to fund redevelopment activity and 3 property acquisitions. Average monthly revenue per unit for the properties sold year-to-date was about $740. Average monthly revenue per unit for our 3 acquisitions year-to-date is about $1,400, almost twice. And average un-trended monthly revenue per unit for year-to-date redevelopment starts is expected to be about $2,100, or nearly 3x the rate of the properties sold. As I said, our portfolio gets better and better.","Our redevelopment business headed by Dan Matula is ramping up, and the 5 projects we have under way are on track. We expect these projects, together with 5 others to be started later this year, to add about $2 per share in net asset value when completed over the next 2 years or so.","Our balance sheet is getting stronger under Ernie's careful watch. Year-to-date through July, we reduced total leverage by more than $0.5 billion, about $600 million from redemption of preferred stocks, with increases in property debt from acquisitions, including limited partner transactions, almost offset by monthly amortization and asset sales. As a result, and with steady earnings growth, we reduced leverages of multiple of current quarter EBITDA from 9.5 at the start of the year to just over 8 today. We're on track to meet our target of 7:1 within the next 18 months or so.","Our business strategy is simple: own and operate apartments in a cross section of large U.S. markets and upgrade our portfolio by redevelopment, selective acquisitions and sale of lower rated properties. Through this end, we've announced plans to exit the Asset Management business by sale of NAPICO later this year and to largely exit the Affordable business by sale of individual properties over the next 5 years or so. We're on track to execute both decisions. Through simplification, we expect higher quality earnings, lower overhead costs and greater transparency.","In January, the Aimco Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.18. Meeting this week, the board raised the dividend again, this time to $0.20 per share, still below a 60% payout ratio. In sum, business is good. We have a capable management team and outstanding teammates, both on-site and off-site. We're working hard and working well together to take full advantage of the excellent apartment market conditions. We're making solid progress in our plans to create shareholder value over the longer term.","Now for a more detailed report on second quarter operations, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith, Head of Property Operations. Keith?","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Terry. As we closed out the first half of 2012, we successfully improved upon our first quarter start with our second quarter results. Conventional Same Store revenue was up 4.6% year-over-year, up 4.4% year-to-date and up 1% compared to the first quarter. We're pleased with our overall performance and particularly with our ability to grow year-over-year revenues from one quarter to the next.","Keeping with revenue for a moment. Second quarter blended rates were up 5%, with new leases up 4.3% and renewals up 5.7% on a lease-to-lease basis. New, renewal and blended lease rates all improved sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of 2012 and creates a book of business that will earn in this fall and into 2013.","During July, these rates continued their positive momentum. Blended lease rates were up 5.3%, with new lease rates up 4.5% and renewal rates up 6.3%. July's average daily occupancy was 94.9% on par with June's result. August and September renewal offers went out with 7% to 9% increases, and October renewals are going out with 6% to 8% increases, a minimal seasonal adjustment.","Turnover was 45.7% for the quarter compared to 45.1% for first quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on customer retention as we not only achieve higher rent increases on renewal rents, but also because it allows us to keep our costs down.","We have not seen any material changes in reasons for move-outs over the last several quarters. The top 3 reasons being: career moves at 24%, pricing at 21% and purchasing homes at 14%. While we have also been tracking move-outs to home rental, it has thus far been negligible. We are successfully replacing our move-outs with better qualified residents at higher rents. We had 6,900 move-ins during the second quarter with an average income of $87,000, and median income of $60,000 and a rent-to-income ratio of 21.5%. Second quarter Conventional Same Store property operating expenses were up 240 basis points year-over-year due to increases in taxes and insurance. Property level operating expenses are actually down 1.1% year-over-year. The net result of all this was a year-over-year NOI growth of 5.9%.","Let me provide some market-specific color. Our top 10 markets represent 2\/3 of our revenue. The top 5 performers had revenue increases from 5% to nearly 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was led by the Bay Area, followed by Miami, Boston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Our steady performers for the quarter with midrange growth of 4% to 5% were Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And rounding out the top 10 markets were Orange County at 3.4% and San Diego at 3.3%. Orange County is reaccelerating, with new lease and renewal price increases at 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively, over the trailing 4 weeks while simultaneously improving occupancy month-over-month.","As an update to our expansion in the Bay Area, pre-leasing at our Pacific Bay Vista community is now successfully well underway, with our first occupancy scheduled for later this quarter. We are building upon our second quarter successes with a solid July and setting up well for a solid third quarter and beyond. With great thanks to our team in the field for a strong first half to the year, I'll turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?","Ernest M. Freedman","Thanks, Keith. Today I will report on financial results, portfolio and redevelopment activities, balance sheet activities, and finally, I will provide a guidance update.","Beginning with financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.46 per share was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, primarily due to $0.02 from outperformance from property operations, consisting of both higher revenues in our Affordable portfolio and lower expenses in our Conventional portfolio, and $0.03 due to a number of items, including $0.02 related to an unexpected recovery from a previous casualty loss and lower-than-anticipated insurance losses.","Turning to the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 16 properties with about 2,200 units, including 5 low-rated Conventional properties at an average NOI cap rate of 7.1%. These properties had an average revenue per unit of $825 compared to our portfolio today of $1,290. We also sold 11 Affordable properties at an average NOI cap rate of 10.1%. Sales in the second quarter were a mix of higher and lower quality Affordable assets, with the higher quality assets generating cap rates in the range of 6.75% to 8%.","In June, we acquired a property located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for $39 million. The acquisition was funded in part by newly placed nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 42 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $4,000, and its average rents are approximately 38% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through significant capital upgrades in select units and operational improvements. The property debt used to help finance the acquisition is a 10-year note with a local bank at a fixed rate of 3.95%.","In July, we acquired for $19.7 million a property located in downtown San Diego adjacent to the Gaslamp district. The acquisition was funded in part by the assumption of nonrecourse property debt and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower rated properties. The acquired property consists of 84 apartment homes and 8,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is approximately $1,880, and its average rents are approximately 15% higher than the local market average. We intend to add value to the acquisition through operational improvements. The property debt assumed has a remaining term of 4.7 years and an interest rate of 5.51%.","For the year, properties acquired had an average revenue per unit of about $1,400 compared to $740 for our properties sold, helping to further our goal of increasing overall revenues per unit for our portfolio.","As to redevelopment activities, we described on our last earnings call the 10 projects we expect to have under redevelopment in 2012, which include properties located in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, Chicago, Center City Philadelphia and South Florida. During the second quarter, our team in Chicago began the construction of 28 new townhomes on a vacant land parcel at our Elm Creek property. Current market rents for comparable products average approximately $2,950 per unit today, and first occupancy is expected in the fourth quarter of 2012.","We also continued construction activity at our redevelopment in Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California, and our first residents will move in later this quarter. Phase 1 of Lincoln Place was completed in April, and 50 returning residents have moved into those completed units.","Looking ahead, we are nearing completion of the common area amenity upgrades at The Palazzo in West Los Angeles and expect to deliver these improvements in early September. Additionally, we expect to begin delivering upgraded luxury penthouse units for lease ups in the fourth quarter.","We are set to begin Phase 2 construction at Lincoln Place as soon as the financing is in place, which we expect to be in the third quarter. During the second half of this year, we expect to start construction at 2900 on First in Seattle, The Preserve at Marin in Marin County, California, and The Sterling and Park Towne Place, both located in Center City, Philadelphia. And we plan to invest a total of $400 million in these 10 projects, with $125 million to $150 million this year, and the balance over the next 2 to 3 years. We expect these projects to generate current returns greater than 7% and free cash flow internal rate of returns in excess of 10%. A deep pipeline of additional opportunities within our portfolio that allows for future redevelopment investment of $150 million to $200 million per year exists.","Regarding the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we provided leverage targets that we expected to meet by the end of 2015. Specifically, we noted our goal to have debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of less than 7x and EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of greater than 2.5x.","Since our last earnings call, Aimco has made significant progress toward these targets with the redemption of more than $300 million of preferred stock during the second quarter and redemption of an additional $300 million in July. Our current and projected coverages for this year on a pro forma basis are as follows: debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of 8.2x currently and 7.7x by year end; EBITDA coverage of interest and preferred dividends of 2.2x currently and 2.3x by year end.","Most importantly, we now expect to achieve our leverage target of debt and preferred equity to EBITDA by early 2014, almost 2 years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Future leverage reduction is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization from retained earnings. Preferred stock redemptions were funded by 2 common stock offerings and option exercises during the second quarter and the exercise of a greenshoe in early July, which generated net proceeds to Aimco of approximately $642 million. In total, Aimco issued 24.2 million shares at an average price of $26.53.","Through these transactions, we expect annual FFO and AFFO to increase by $0.04 and $0.12 per share, respectively. Our guidance revisions announced last night take into account the impact for 2012, which is a decrease of $0.01 for FFO and an increase of $0.05 for AFFO. As Terry mentioned, in keeping with its focus on growing dividends with AFFO, Aimco's board increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20, effective with our next dividend this month.","In addition to the increase in FFO and AFFO from our equity offerings, we expect to further increase earnings in each of the next few years due to activity with our property debt. Each year, we amortize approximately $80 million of property debt using retained earnings. This equates to about $0.03 of increased earnings each year. In addition, we have between $200 million and $300 million of debt coming due in each of the next 3 years. Refinancing these maturities at today's interest rates equates to an average of $0.03 of additional interest savings in each of the next several years.","Finally, going back to our portfolio, we have discussed our interest in potentially accelerating sales anticipated for the next couple of years into 2012. One of our identified use of proceeds, the redemption of high-cost preferred equity, no longer exists. That said, if a compelling opportunity presents itself for the sale of some or all of the contemplated assets, we'll certainly give it consideration and compare its merits to the potential use of such proceeds.","Finally, as to guidance, we are increasing full year pro forma FFO guidance to a range of $1.78 to $1.86 per share and AFFO of $1.30 to $1.38 per share. Guidance assumes Conventional Same Store net operating income growth of 6% to 7%, which is unchanged at the midpoint. We have narrowed our revenue guidance to an increase in revenues of 4.75% to 5.25%, unchanged at the midpoint, and we have updated our expense guidance with expenses expected to increase 2% to 2.5%, an improvement of 25 basis points at the midpoint.","Affordable Same Store net operating income guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% is a 200 basis point improvement at the midpoint. Taken together, total same-store NOI growth is now expected to be in a range from 5.5% to 6.5%.","We've also increased our dispositions guidance by $50 million at the midpoint.","For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.43 to $0.47 per share, with year-over-year Conventional Same Store net operating income growth projected to be 6.5% to 7.5%.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, I'll turn it over to you for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jana Galan from BoA Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was curious, can you provide the cap rate on the Chelsea and the San Diego acquisitions?","John E. Bezzant","This is John Bezzant. We don't typically provide cap rates on our acquisitions.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. A question on the updated FFO guidance. You beat second quarter by kind of $0.05 of the midpoint that you were previously expecting, but you only took it up $0.02. And am I missing anything with the higher share count or timing of dispositions? Or are you seeing something that's making you a little bit more cautious for the second half than what you were thinking last quarter?","Ernest M. Freedman","Jana, this is Ernie. No, I can walk you through that. You're right to point out that we had a beat in the second quarter by $0.05, and we only raised guidance by $0.02. The reason we didn't raise it by the full $0.05 is one of those pennies has to do with what you describe as share count, from doing that second equity offering because of the timing of it where we'll have 7 months of preferred dividend expense -- excuse me, 7 months of share count but only 6 months of savings from the preferreds, we'd lose $0.01 there. Also we had an outperformance in operations in the second quarter and for the year we've kept our guidance the same. So that's about a $0.01 there, so that was around timing of expenses and some things like that. And then the other $0.01 is just kind of rounding with some things, and so that's why we kept guidance where we did, raising it the $0.02 versus the $0.05.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to ask about acquisitions and you identifying them as being some large percentage over the market average in terms of rents and why that's a good thing. I mean, you've said you're 15% above the local area in San Diego. Wouldn't you rather be 15% below the local area? I'm not understanding that fully.","John E. Bezzant","Sure, Rich. John Bezzant here. It's really a matter of quality of the asset in relation to the local market. As we've talked about over the years, we want to be a B\/B+ portfolio that we define as kind of 90% to 120% of local market average rent. San Diego asset falls right smack in the middle of that as a good, solid B+ asset. The Chelsea asset is an A asset, it's an A- asset. And we look at that, both of those opportunities, as well as the Phoenix asset we bought earlier in the year, which would also be, in relation to Phoenix price point, kind of an A- asset. We look at all of those as value-add plays. Those are -- we are opportunistically buying where we see opportunities. We're using these acquisitions to cover, via 1031, some tax liabilities on some of the lower rated assets as we sell them, but...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I get the quality thing. I guess, doesn't that though still, even if you do redeploy or deploy some proceeds, doesn't that kind of limit your upside, if you're assuming you're buying at pretty low cap rates in some good markets and you're at 15%, 20%, 25% above the area, I'd say that the ability to raise rents from that point are going to be pretty tough, no?","John E. Bezzant","Well, there's a couple of ways to look at it. Certainly at that price point, we've got a customer that's different than what we would have in a C asset. And we feel like we've got an opportunity to raise rents there through product quality and customer type that we draw into those properties. It's different than if we went in and bought C assets. Nominally, we could take that at a face rate, and say, well, if we had $600 rent, there's more room to raise rents to get up to average. But those $600 rents at a property are reflective of property condition, age, economic obsolescence on the property and other things. And so, again, we feel like on the properties that we're buying, we've got opportunity to have outsized growth. Some of that is related to the submarket, where they're located, and that we feel like we've got submarkets with greater growth potential than those in the submarkets where we're selling. And some of it is related to the physical asset itself, either through management enhancements and improvements or through physical improvements at the property.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just, Ernie, if you could just explain this for me -- I was just rereading your comments because I wasn't following. You've said that the preferred redemptions in the equity increased FFO by $0.04, but then you said the guidance assumes a decrease. I didn't follow that logic. Maybe the transcript is just not showing it right, but can you just go through that again? What's the impact from the preferred redemptions and the equity issuance on the guidance, those 2.","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure, I didn't realize the transcripts came out that quick, but...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, they're talking right along with us right now.","Ernest M. Freedman","All right. So what happens, I gave 2 sets of numbers, Rich, one was on an annual basis, so if we had 12 months of share increases and 12 months of the dividend reductions because of the redemptions, so on an annual basis, we would expect FFO and AFFO to improve by $0.04 and $0.12. Now this year, because there was a 30-day period from when we call the preferreds until we actually redeem them, for both of those issuances, we had a 1 month where we actually have more shares outstanding than that dividend savings. And so that's why the impact in the partial year is what I described, which is a negative $0.01 on the FFO side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Terry, I just -- I want to test your memory if I can. I'm curious how you think about pricing. Where do you think unlevered cash IRRs are right now as a spread to Treasuries versus, say, where they were 10 years ago or even 20 years ago? I want your perspective on where you think that's gone.","Terry Considine","You are attacking my memory, and I'm thinking about it. But John has raised his hand, so I'm going to ask him to start, Jeff, while I mull this over.","John E. Bezzant","Jeff, I think we look at them at kind of roughly 400 basis points today in spread. And if you look back historically, that's a wide spread. If we were to go back 5 years ago in Treasuries, it's -- again, don't test my memory and quote me on this. But if Treasuries are 3.5, you probably were down anywhere from 250 to 300 basis point spread to cap rates in that kind of 4 to 5 ago -- year ago range. As we look at it and analyze it, there's some thought that there's room in this spread for interest rates to move a little bit. If they -- everybody is worried about low interest rates, low cap rates. But we feel like there may be a little bit of recovery room in the spread before cap rates start moving, if interest rates tick up a little bit.","Terry Considine","Jeff, I think you also asked about free cash flow IRRs. And if you go back 20 years, there were higher cap rates and -- but also a higher Treasury and then a higher -- but I think the IRR spread to the Treasury was probably a little bit -- was higher than it would be today if you had a standardized risk-free rate. When we look today, it seems to many people that the risk-free rate is unusually low perhaps because the Fed is the largest purchaser of Treasuries. And so -- and that it's too low by comparison to, for example, inflation because of all the troubles in Europe and so forth. And so I think, as John said, there's -- it would be my sense that cap rates -- that interest rates could recover back to that more normal level without having the same impact on cap rates. And I'm not sure if I've answered your question or just confused myself. Is that responsive?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. No, you have. And I guess where I was going with it, I was curious if that implied that you thought that cap rates could actually compress further from this point? Or you share the view that over the next 2 years instead, it's more of the industry's pricing and interest rate increase.","Terry Considine","I think the market is generally thinking that the risk-free -- this current risk-free rate is a little bit too low. And so I don't know if they're pricing in an increase so much as they're thinking that it's abnormally influenced by flight from Europe, by the Fed buying and factors that are sort of extraneous or exogenous to the economy. And so the cap rates have never gone down as much as the risk-free rate has.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I could just ask a quick question of, I think Ernie, is what's behind the decelerating pace in year-over-year new lease growth over the course of Q2?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sorry, say that again, Jeff?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The year-over-year pace of the monthly changes in new lease growth seemed to decelerate over Q2. What's behind that?","Ernest M. Freedman","Well, I'll take a first stab at it and then turn over to Keith, Jeff. You saw that we had stronger results in April, May and then June is what you're pointing out, and then Keith mentioned in his comments that we saw a rebound in July back up almost to where the rates were at in April and May. Keith, do you want to give some market color around that?","Keith M. Kimmel","Jeff, I would just -- I'd just add that those lease rates that are up in the second quarter were also against our hardest comps last year, that we were really pushing rates then. So we -- there was a slight deceleration, but really it's picked right back up here in July, and that's right on plan as we are right in our peak of seasonality and where the majority of our leases are signed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Eric. Just based on your guidance, it looks like you're expecting a nice pickup in asset sales in the back half of the year. And given your commentary, it would seem like a lot of that is going to come from your Affordable portfolio, which tend to trade at higher cap rates. So I'm curious, as you think about it, what's the best way to sort of minimize the dilution from those sales, or is that just sort of a secondary concern relative to deleveraging the balance sheet?","Ernest M. Freedman","Let me just -- this is Ernie. Let me address a couple of things there. You're absolutely right that we have an acceleration expected with property sales in the second half, but I wouldn't say that it's so much from the Affordable side as it is from the Conventional. And it's actually probably more weighted toward the Conventional, those are bigger assets that will generate larger increases. In terms of the number of properties, it will be more Affordable, but the vast majority of the dollars will be coming from the Conventional side. But you raise a good point, Eric. Ultimately, we look at what do these properties generate from a projected internal rate of return perspective or free cash flow internal rate of return. And even though the cap rates on the Affordable side, the NOI cap rates, tend to be higher, when you factor in all the cash flows from those properties, including capital replacement costs, they come in with free cash flow internal rates of return that are projected well south of 7, usually in the 6 range or maybe a little bit lower. And so what that does mean is potentially some FFO dilution. What it certainly means though is much less and if not maybe slightly accretive to AFFO because we lose that CR. And then importantly, we look at that trade and what are we getting for that. And John kind of described how that works with some of the acquisitions we've done and importantly, the work that Dan Matula is doing on the redevelopment side. And so it could cause some short-term dilution in funds from operations, not so much, if at all, in adjusted funds from operations, but a stronger portfolio and stronger return projections going forward.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. That's very helpful. And I guess just along the same lines, I mean, what percentage would come from Conventional versus Affordable in terms of, I guess, gross dollars?","Ernest M. Freedman","John?","John E. Bezzant","It's about a 2:1 ratio, roughly.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, you did 2 equity raises within a fairly short period of time. So my first question is just why not just do a large equity raise right off the bat? And then I'm just curious if there's anything to the timing there. And then secondly, you mentioned that most of the leveraging going forward would come from growth. Is there other things that you could do by raising the equity, or are you set on just sort of earnings growth and NOI growth to deleverage the balance sheet?","Ernest M. Freedman","Sure. With regards to our equity activities, Eric, in the second quarter, you rightfully point out, we did 2 transactions pretty much back to back, and we gave consideration as to how we wanted to do that. And we thought, in talking to many advisers and some of the folks from the investment banking side and the people who helped to develop the transaction. We thought, \"Let's take one bite at the apple,\" and we felt confident that would go well and we're pleased with the result. And 40 days later, we saw we had an opportunity to go for a second bite. We just thought that would be potentially the more efficient way to do it. And importantly, after seeing people at the June NAREIT meeting, just take -- let's take leverage off the table. And we're able to do that by doing the second deal. With regards for the opportunity to do further deleveraging, where we stand today, we like the glide path that we're on, that through property debt amortization, which is about $80 million, $85 million a year through retained earnings as well as projected -- continued NOI growth, in our case NOI growth accelerating as we get into the second half of the year, as you can see from our guidance. It puts us on a path to be about where we want to be in about 18 to 20 months. So we feel pretty good about that. We will always keep options open, but where we stand today, we think the right thing for us to do is to kind of do as we've laid out with folks and let things run their course over that period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question, just to go back to the revenues there, just because you've got such -- built in a nice acceleration there on the Conventional Same Store. Can you walk us through the kind of components of that? How much is occupancy? How much is -- how much you expect to come from rate?","Ernest M. Freedman","Mike, I'll take a first stab. This is Ernie, and I'll ask Keith to chime in. Our guidance for the year is we expect that occupancy to come in between 95.5% and 96%. Importantly, this item implies for the second half, we're going to kind of be right in between there, so that's exactly what we did in the first half of 2012. Last year, in the second half of the year, our occupancy was around 95.2%. So on a year-over-year basis, Mike, we're going to have a nice pickup in occupancy as we projected today of approximately maybe 40 to 50 basis points. So we're going to get some acceleration from maintaining occupancy levels as I've just described. That's going to help somewhat. And then, Keith has given out the information on what's happening with renewal rates and new lease rates. In July, we actually saw our best performance on a blended basis of 5.3. And we feel pretty good that's where, at least going into out of season, we're going to be there. And so that puts us in a good position to have similar rate growth as you saw in our second quarter. So all that math adds up plus what we're doing in other income, to have a second half that's going to be stronger than the first half on a year-over-year basis in terms of revenue growth.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","How much differential do you between renewals, between where renewal notices go out and where renewals are achieved?","Keith M. Kimmel","Michael, this is Keith. We've seen a historical average of 100 to 150 basis point melt from what we send out, the asking, to what the actual take rate is.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Then just my second question, can you just give us an update on Lincoln Place. When you expect to start Phase 2 with that one? And any cost projections or anything you can think of at this point, just given the size of that project as well as the potential opening of -- I mean, not the potential, but Google's potential impact to that property?","Ernest M. Freedman","Yes. No, you've pointed out a very important fact that we're very excited about with Google. With Lincoln Place, we completed Phase 1, which has enabled 50 returning tenants to come back in. They're fully in. They're moved in. And everything is pretty much set to go with Phase 2 or Phrase 3. We're just working on the final details and keeping our fingers crossed in getting our loan application finalized and getting our commitment for financing. As I mentioned in my -- in our prepared remarks, we're hopeful that's going to happen sometime before the end of the third quarter, and we can mobilize very quickly right after that within a few weeks and start construction. We'd mentioned in some of our various investor presentations over the last 6 or 7 months, our expected cost to go on that project is about $150 million. We'll provide more specific numbers, specific information around what we think we can achieve for rents, as well as returns, probably later this quarter once we have the financing locked up and we have everything buttoned up. Mike raises a very important point. We learned in the last few months that Google has decided to place their Southern California campus about a mile from the property, a little bit less than a mile at the Gold's Gym location. I'll let Keith speak to that, he's a Southern California guy, but we're just very excited. Those are exactly the type of customer who could be a great resident for us at Lincoln Place.","Keith M. Kimmel","Thanks, Ernie. I would just point out, Michael, that, I mean, that essentially those Google employees will be able to either walk to our community or ride bikes. And the location is just, one, it's a historical location that is literally right in the heart of Venice. Roughly 3,000 employees is what they're talking about coming there. And of course, they're just the type of customers we'd love to have living in our community.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","In your press release, and also I think Ernie alluded to it earlier in his comments, it was discussed that, to paraphrase, you might accelerate asset sales if there was a compelling opportunity. Terry, could you just kind of talk in general terms about just what those possibilities could range from?","Terry Considine","David, I'd be delighted to. Aimco looks at all of its capital decision making using a consistent metric that we call free cash flow internal rate of return. And so that's a mouthful, but what we mean by that is just everything from net operating income to free cash flow. And for consistency and comparability, we subtract $1,200 a unit of capital replacement spending. So in Ernie's talk earlier about adjusting Affordable NOI cap rates to free cash flow, it means that free cash flow is a significantly lower number, particularly at lower price points. Then we look at it as an internal rate of return, adjusting it for expected growth, generally relying on an average of data providers for the particular submarket. And then very importantly, we adjust the exit cap rate to reflect the fact that today's cap rates are influenced by the very high rent growth that we're all now enjoying. But over a longer period of time, it's more conservative to -- not to predict that, but to predict something like the 20-year average. So we use that measure. And what would motivate us to sell either one asset or large portfolio of assets would be our opportunity to redeploy the capital at a higher, risk-adjusted free cash flow internal rate of return. And so, I wouldn't want you to take away from Ernie's comments the sense that there's a large transaction pending, that's not the case. But we are in the market actively. John underwrites 1 or 2 or 3 transactions a week. We look at opportunities large and small. And if we found the right circumstance, where we could sell lower rated assets at a free cash flow internal rate of return, which I think is probably averaged sub 7 since the start of the year and redeploy it at a free flow internal rate of return in higher quality assets, north of 8 going forward, something like that spread might be attractive to us.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. But just, can you help us just better understand your appetite for acquisitions? Is it really dependent on accelerating dispositions beyond plan? Or even if you hit your plan for dispositions for this year, could we see you go above your, maybe, current plans on acquisitions?","Terry Considine","I think, David, that we will meet our current plan in order to fund our current identified uses primarily in the redevelopment area. But what would cause a change in that is not because of an opportunity to sell more assets or an opportunity to buy at today's market, it's by joining the 2 together. We think of them as paired trades, if you will, that in today's market to have above average returns, we need some value-added opportunity, some opportunity to upgrade the physical product or to provide better leasing and better cost control, as Keith has been able to do. And then we need to fund it with a lower cost of capital provided by an attractive sale. So it's a combination of what we think of as a paired trade.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. We'd now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Considine for any closing remarks.","Terry Considine","Well, thank you for your interest in Aimco. If you have further questions, please feel comfortable to call Elizabeth Coalson, Ernie Freedman or me with any of that. And I wish you all a good day and a great weekend. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your telephone lines."]}}
