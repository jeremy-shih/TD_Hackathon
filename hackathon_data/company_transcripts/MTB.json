My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the M&T Bank Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]   Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to discuss the fourth quarter as well as our full year 2011 results. Let me begin by reviewing the highlights, after which, Don and I will take your questions. Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.04 for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $1.32 earned in the third quarter of 2011.","Net income for the recent quarter was $148 million compared with $183 million in the linked quarter. Earnings for the recent quarter were impacted by 4 items I'd like to highlight. We reported a $79 million pretax other-than-temporary impairment charge on our 20% minority investment in Bayview Lending Group or BLG. This amounts to $49 million on an after-tax basis or $0.39 per common share. This reduces M&T's investment in BLG to an estimated fair value of $115 million. This charge is reflected in other costs of operations in the income statement.","In 2008, M&T Bank Corporation filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. and several other parties, seeking damages arising from a 2007 investment in collateralized debt obligations. The lawsuit alleged, among other things, that the quality of the investment was not as represented. This matter has now been fully settled, and as part of that settlement, M&T received $55 million. This equates to a $34 million after-tax benefit or $0.27 per common share.","Subsequently, M&T made a $30 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation. As most of you know, we've long articulated the view that healthy communities are the foundation of successful businesses. This belief lies at the heart of M&T's community banking business philosophy. Grants made to not-for-profit agencies by the foundation are focused on improving the quality of life in our communities and increasing economic opportunities where customers and employees -- where our customers and employees live and work.","Lastly, we recorded a $25 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on certain securities in our portfolio of non-agency MBS. This equates to $15 million after tax or $0.12 per common share. Taken together, these 4 items reduced both GAAP and net operating income by a net $48 million after tax or $0.38 per common share in the fourth quarter.","M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effects of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions. Included in GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were merger-related expenses of $16 million related to the Wilmington Trust acquisition, amounting to $10 million after tax or $0.08 per common share. This compares with $16 million after-tax or $0.13 per common share in the prior quarter.","After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was also $10 million or $0.08 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $11 million or $0.08 per common share in the third quarter. M&T's net operating income for the quarter, which excludes those items, was $168 million compared with $210 million in the linked quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.20 in the recent quarter compared with $1.53 in the linked quarter. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $625 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, up slightly from $623 million in the linked quarter. The net interest margin contracted during the fourth quarter, averaging 3.60%, down 8 basis points from 3.68% in the third quarter.","Some 4 basis points of its decline can be attributed to lower prepayment penalties and lower interest on nonperforming loans. The remaining 4 basis points amount to what I\u2019d characterize as core margin compression as $1.5 billion of average loans and investment securities came onto the balance sheet at yields lower than the book overall. The lower yields were partially offset by lower borrowing costs and a higher proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits.","In both the third and fourth quarters, we held large balances of excess liquidity at the Fed: $1.85 billion in the fourth quarter and $1.7 billion in the third quarter with very modest yields. In both quarters, this excess liquidity diluted the net interest margin by some 9 basis points. The deposits that were the source of that excess liquidity, primarily trust related, have now been drawn -- have now been withdrawn or used to fund late fourth quarter loan growth. Funds held at the Fed as of December 31 were just $155 million.","I'll discuss our outlook for the margin balances and net interest income in a few moments. As for the balance sheet, average loans for the quarter increased by approximately $900 million or an annualized 6% to $59.1 billion from $58.2 billion in the third quarter. On that same basis, compared with the 2011 third quarter, changes in average loans by category were as follows: Commercial and industrial loans grew by an annualized 10%, loans to auto dealers to finance inventory within that category grew by $217 million, while all other C&I loans increased by $168 million or an annualized 5%.","Commercial real estate loans grew at an annualized 2%, residential real estate loans grew at an annualized 27% and consumer loans declined by 3%, driven by lower indirect auto loans and enclosed in home equity loans.","On an end-of-period basis, loan growth was somewhat stronger. Total loans at the end of 2011 increased by some $1.7 billion or 12% annualized from September 30. Put another way, we entered 2012 with loans already more than $1 billion higher than 2011's fourth quarter average.","Average investment securities grew by approximately $600 million to $7.6 billion. This growth includes purchases over the course of the third quarter which weren't fully reflected in the third quarter average as well as additional purchases during the fourth quarter. Average core customer deposits, which exclude foreign deposits and CDs over 250,000, increased in the fourth quarter by approximately $2.2 billion or an annualized 15% from the third quarter. To summarize, core organic growth in both loans and deposits was robust during the recent quarter.","Turning to non-interest income. Including securities gains and losses, the $55 million benefit received from the CDO settlement I mentioned, non-interest -- excuse me. Excluding the securities gains and losses and the $55 million benefit received from the CDO settlement I mentioned, non-interest income was $368 million for the recent quarter compared with $378 million in the linked quarter.","The $10 million decline was attributable to the implementation of the so-called Durbin Amendment, which caps pricing on debit card interchange fees. Those fees declined by about $17 million compared with the third quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts, which include debit card interchange, were $104 million during the recent quarter, down from $122 million in the linked quarter.","Mortgage banking fees were $41 million for the quarter, up from $38 million in the linked quarter. The increase is due to higher income from mortgage servicing and from commercial mortgage banking operations.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, excluding merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $706 million for the fourth quarter. Included in this figure is the $79 million pretax other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity investment in Bayview Lending Group. Also included in this figure is the $30 million contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation.","Excluding those 2 items, operating expenses were down from the third quarter of 2011. Salaries and benefits were down $13 million to $313 million in the fourth quarter, as compared with the linked quarter. The decline in -- is in large -- the decline is largely due to lower salaries and benefits related to our merger with Wilmington Trust. This reflects the benefits arising from the banking systems consolidation completed in late August but which had not yet materialized in the third quarter.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses as well as intangible amortization and merger-related expenses -- gains and expenses, was 67.4% for the fourth quarter compared with 61.8% in the third quarter of 2011. The aggregate impact of the $79 million impairment charge related to BLG, the $55 million litigation settlement and the $30 million charitable contribution increased the efficiency ratio by 7 -- by some 7 percentage points in the fourth quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit trends continue to show modest improvement. Non-accrual loans decreased to $1.1 billion or 1.83% of total loans at the end of 2011 from $1.11 billion or 1.91% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter. Other nonperforming assets, consisting of assets taken into foreclosure of defaulted loans, were $157 million as of December 31 compared with $150 million as of September 30.","Net charge-offs for the quarter were $74 million compared with $57 million in the third quarter of 2011. As we've noted on more than one occasion, at this comparatively low level of charge-offs, a single loan can make the difference between an increase or a decrease in any quarter. In this case, we charged off approximately $19 million on a single residential development project in -- located in Northern Virginia. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 50 basis points, up from 39 basis points in the linked quarter but very much in line with the full year net charge-off ratio of 47 basis points.","The provision for credit losses was $74 million in the fourth quarter compared with $58 million in the linked quarter. The provision matched net charge-offs, and as a result, the allowance for loan losses was $908 million at the end of 2011. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.51% compared with 1.56% in the linked quarter. The loan loss allowance as of December 31, 2011, was 3.4x net charge-offs for the past year.","We disclose loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they're deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say there is a low risk of principal loss. Loans 90 days past due, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition, were $288 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $253 million or 88% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $240 million and $210 million, respectively, at the end of September.","M&T's estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio was 6.86% at the end of 2011. At the same time, M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 6.40% at the end of the fourth quarter. This reflects higher retained earnings offset by a slightly larger end-of-quarter balance sheet as well as a higher accumulated loss in other comprehensive income. Last week, we submitted our capital plans to the regulators as required under the terms of the 2012 capital plan review, and as with other participants, we expect to receive comments by the end of the first quarter.","Before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to highlight some of what we accomplished in 2011. We consummated the Wilmington Trust merger and took a major step in integrating process in -- the process by completing the conversion of the Wilmington Trust branches and the back office to M&T's core banking system.","Simultaneous with the merger, we purchased and retired Wilmington Trust's $330 million of TARP preferred stock from the Treasury Department, as well as retiring an additional $370 million of M&T's own TARP preferred. We were able to take advantage of an open window in the capital markets in the second quarter by issuing a new series of perpetual preferred stock that we viewed as an attractive fixed rate -- attractive at a fixed rate of 6 7\/8. This offering served as both a source of financing for the purchase -- a repurchase of the TARP preferred as well as to partially fill the hole created by the coming disallowance of trust-preferred stock as an element of the Tier 1 capital structure starting in 2013.","We saw a continued improvement in credit trends, with net charge-offs for the year down 23% to $265 million or 47 basis points of average loans and provisioning for loan losses down 27% to $270 million. And we continue to build our capital ratios, particularly the risk-weighted regulatory ratios. As I noted, the Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 6.86% at the end of 2011, up 35 basis points from 6.51% at the end of 2010, all while absorbing Wilmington Trust without a secondary common equity offering and accommodating loan growth. For the full year 2011, diluted earnings per share were $6.35, an increase of 12% over $5.69 in 2010.","Net income for 2011 was $859 million, which represents a 17% increase over the $736 million in 2010. The GAAP basis net income for the full year of 2010 (sic) [2011], expressed as a rate of average assets and average common shareholders' equity, was 1.16% and 9.67%, respectively, improved from 1.08% and 9.3% in 2010.","Included in GAAP earnings for 2011 was a net after-tax merger-related gain from the Wilmington Trust acquisition of $13 million or $0.10 per common share, and this compares to $16 million or $0.14 per common share of after-tax merger per common share net -- of after-tax merger-related gain in 2010 related to the K Bank transaction. Also included in these earnings for the past year was after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $38 million or $0.30 per common share compared with $35 million or $0.29 per share in 2010.","Net operating income for 2011, which excludes those items I just mentioned, was $884 million, an increase of 17% from $755 million in 2010. Diluted net operating income per share was $6.55 for 2011, an increase of 12% from $5.84 per common share in 2010. The rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.26% and 17.96%, respectively, for 2011 compared with 17 -- excuse me, compared with 1.17% and 18.95% in 2010. These high-teen returns are particularly notable.","Lastly, as most of you know, we don't offer much in the way of earnings guidance, but we'll share our thoughts on our general outlook. Our balance sheet continues to be positioned for slight downward pressure on the net interest margin as a result of new loans and securities coming on to the balance sheet at lower yields than those maturing. That said, the fourth quarter net interest margin of 3.60% could likely prove to be abnormally low, given the lower levels of cash we currently hold at the Federal Reserve as well as lower levels of prepayment penalties and interest on nonperforming loans we've seen -- that we saw in the recent quarter.","Overall, we expect the full year net interest margin for 2012 to be modestly lower than the 3.73% reported for the full year of 2011. When combined with mid single-digit loan growth, we anticipate continued growth in net interest income throughout 2012.","We remain very focused on expenses both on the day-to-day costs of operating the business as well as on achieving the remaining cost-savings opportunities arising from the Wilmington Trust integration. Realizing those opportunities should materialize throughout the year with the majority of the impact to occur in the second half following our planned second quarter trust-to-systems conversion. In addition, I'd expect a limited amount of additional merger-related expenses, approximately $10 million, to be incurred over the first half of 2012, combined with the $84 million of merger-related expenses incurred to date and this would keep us below the $100 million we outlined back on September 12.","We remain cautious with our outlook for credit. After all, we're bankers. The economy is growing, albeit slowly, but unemployment still remains high and the housing sector is unsettled. We expect continued slow, steady improvement in criticized and non-accrual loans, with credit costs improving over a long-time horizon.","Lastly, I'll remind you that M&T's first quarter results have tended to be seasonally low, reflecting fewer days and higher expenses associated with the FICA reset, accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense and the 401(k) match. Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","We will now open up the call to questions before which Jackie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]   Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with KBW.","Matthew T. Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","As it relates to the seasonal increase in comp you tend to experience in the first quarter, can you give us a sense for whether or not that might be different this time around in terms of the magnitude partly since you \u2013 I would assume you still have some cost savings coming to you from Wilmington? I guess asked another way is can you give us a sense for how much in the way of cost saves you got this past quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, let me answer you 2 ways. I mean, I just tend to -- there's never a lot of big change in sort of what we're doing around comps so my sense is that you\u2019re looking back to what happened in the fourth, the first quarter. The last couple of years is a good gauge. Maybe, on its own, it's a little higher because it's a little bit bigger, right, but not significantly larger. And then as I think about where we are, we're pretty pleased with what we've been able to achieve to date. We talked about the trend down in expenses. You saw sort of what happened to the salary and benefit line. And my sense is, if you kind of move your way out, we're probably halfway through the work to get to the overall expense saves that we have. So said another way, if you were to sort of annualize the benefits you saw from the third to the fourth quarter and then looked at the full year impact on that next year, I'd say that number is probably about 1\/2 of what we'll be able to realize then.","Matthew T. Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So you got 10 of the 20 in the run rate?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think, probably a little more. I mean much of the salary and benefits declined. We talked about the $13 million. It\u2019s I think it\u2019s probably a decent gauge of the impact from Wilmington. It might not have all come in salaries, but generally, that's a pretty good gauge.","Donald J. MacLeod","Just to clarify, that would be the quarterly running rate.","Matthew T. Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Correct, okay. Okay, and then on the credit side of things, can you give us a -- it looks like it was, in the 90 days past due, I know a lot of that is government guaranteed, but still, I think, up roughly $40 million or so. Just, anything going on there? And then as a follow-on, just the, how much classified assets improved or maybe have gone the other way?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I have to look at the classified assets. I believe that, that trend was positive. Let me get back to you for a second. The 90 day issue is just a purchase of -- the Ginnie Mae repurchases. So remember, we think it makes a lot of economic sense to buy those government-guaranteed loans out of servicing because, at the end of the day, the economics are better if we do that. So that's just, that's all that really is. Give me one second. So we are down slightly again. I mean, I think, if you look at from our queues, the decline that you saw in the last several -- each of the last several quarters, you'll see a similar decline when we publish our Q, so a steady improvement or a reduction in the classified loan balances.","Matthew T. Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just housekeeping on the tax rate, a little lower this quarter. I'm assuming we bounced back a little bit here...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I think that's right. I think that, obviously when you have some of the net lower effect of the items we mentioned, you still have a fixed tax credit so that'll come up. And then we had probably some slight benefit from some small tax settlements we did with the States that went in our favor. But generally speaking, I think what you'll see is it'll come up a little bit when -- as the earnings come up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to just touch base a little bit on the \u2013 all the extraordinary items. Kind of taking $1.04, you obviously take the $0.38 out; that gets you up to about $1.42. And then when you start to adjust out the integration costs that I've, I heard about an $0.08 there, so like $1.50 was, including still the intangible amortization, but kind of $1.50 is kind of, in my mind, kind of an operating number.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Your math seems good.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and given that, we kind of came into the acquisition of Wilmington Trust with about $1.60 in earnings power. How do you see us kind of recapturing that as we go forward? Is it really still just based into the fact that we're starting to hold more of those mortgages so we get the benefit of that next year, we get the integration costs still coming out? But kind of give us just a feel for how we build back towards the earnings level we were pre the acquisition.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","There are just 2 things that come to mind. I think you're right in the idea that we think it's beneficial to hold mortgages now, so obviously, that benefit will accrue to us in the future. I think -- just by way of example, I think we -- that the fee income that we, that was foregone this past quarter was about 14 -- between $14 million and $15 million, right, so all that comes to you down the road in the form of net interest income. But I think what we can't lose sight of is, what tends to happen is we\u2019ve had a lot of change in regulation. So by way of example, we were just looking at some of our numbers and if we go back to, say, the second quarter of 2010, so 6 quarters ago, and we look at the impact of Durbin overdraft changes, the higher calculation of the FDIC insurance premium, looking at the second quarter of 2010 versus this quarter, that's almost a $40 million difference. So said another way, annualized $160 million, $150 million to $160 million. So what's really been happening is we've sort of been running the bank and you haven't noticed that because our earnings have held up. But we've, through Wilmington and other ways, have been offsetting what has been a really, really heavy regulatory burden. And I think, along with other banks, over time, we're going to have to figure that out. What I do is I focus on the efficiency ratio. And if you look at where our efficiency ratio is, and I think, in large part, because of all the changes, that it's higher than it normally is. And what we'll do is we'll start thinking about how we move that efficiency ratio back to a level that we like and are comfortable with because we think it's a big part of the strength of the bank overall. People talk about capital a lot, but at the end of the day, the strength of your operating earnings and the sort of quality of those earnings are your sort of first line of defense. So I think that's that. It's hard to answer your question any more specifically, Marty, but we're working on it.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just as a curiosity, if you look at the $30 million that you put into the charitable foundation, have you done that in the past? Is this something you typically prefund the next year's expenses? Or in my mind, typically when you have something that's unusual, you can take that and put it into the charitable foundation as a good benefit. But right now, trying to build your capital up, would it not have been more efficient to keep the $30 million and just pay for it as you go because you get the benefit in the capital ratio upfront?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think, a couple. I think I'm looking to answer that a couple of different ways. We feel very, very comfortable about our capital generation. And if you kind of look at the quarter and what we did and we supported $1.7 billion of loan growth and had our adjustment to the value of Bayview, and at the end of the day, I think our Tier 1 common moved down one basis point so we're generating capital very quickly. I also think that if you look back at the history, we've just sort of had a history, whenever you sort of see a bit of a windfall like that, like we saw with the Deutsche Bank situation, that we tend to look at our ability to fund the charitable -- make a funding to the charitable foundation and that's what we did. I think, really explicitly in this case, we've talk a lot about how the health of our communities is really important to the health of M&T Bank and I also think, in this case, there's been a link between Wall Street and what's gone on to the health of the communities out there, so we felt very, very -- we thought it was the right thing to do. When we got the $55 million in cash, we turned around and funded the charitable contribution. So I don't know how to describe it any differently. We feel very comfortable about all the items you mentioned, capital generation, our commitment to the communities. I don't think we thought about it as much as maybe -- as you might think.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And what percent of your annual community budget is funded out of the charitable foundation?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, most of what we do, not all, but most of what we do is managed through the foundation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, I was wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color on the NIM comments you made. So with, I understand well your points about the excess liquidity, but just trying to get a little bit of a gauge in terms of, is it then that 9 basis points of excess liquidity that basically you get back, going forward from a magnitude perspective and then the margin kind is positioned to drip from there? I just want to kind of understand the progression and kind of the magnitude of the get-back from that excess liquidity being now utilized in loan growth.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I mean we quantify that going from the $1.8 billion that we've been running at to down to $1.55 billion was 9 basis points impact. And I guess the way I look at it is the first point I'd make is that, with Wilmington Trust as part of M&T and the opportunity from time to time to get cash, you're going to see a little bit of noise from time to time in the printed net interest margin percentage. But when I step back, we started with a slight borrowing position before the Wilmington Trust transaction. We inherited on the merger day, I think it was $2.6 billion of cash, and we've been carrying that. And now what you've seen is we've been able to put that to work. It's taken some time, but with the securities growth, the loan growth, right, we've been able to sort of utilize that position now, so I think that's a change. And then just as I look at the trends as to where we're headed, as sort of a guess [ph], I just saw that we were a little low on some of the other cash items versus where we've been in past periods. So as I think about it, I think there's clearly some core margin compression that's embedded in our numbers, and I think that, that would accelerate, if you saw, really continued elevated levels of loan and balance sheet growth, right, because it's just sort of new stuff rolling on and replacing, I think, at a lower yield. With a little bit more normalized loan growth from period to period, I think maybe that margin compression might be a little less, and then that sort of is offset by a little bit of repricing that's left on the liability side. So to summarize, the 360 seems a little low, we're going to be lower than we were in the full year last year. That's kind of what we think.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But again, just to confirm then so the premise is that maybe you get the pop in the first, just from the excess liquidity now being utilized, and then underneath that, past that point, the natural direction would be to be slightly down from there.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think, I don't know about the timing, but I think the natural position is slight downward pressure on that margin. And I guess what I was worried about is when I look at where we see ourselves headed, our starting point probably is not the 360 that we posted this quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. My second question is just with regards to the growth that you've seen on the balance sheet and you mentioned continuing to want to retain mortgages. Obviously, that was almost $1 billion of sequential growth. Does the pipeline that you have in terms of originations continue to support that type of growth in the mortgage balances?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I think we did. For our portfolio, we originated last quarter something like a little under $800 million, and then this quarter, we did, I think, a little under $700 million. So just give me one second and I'll see where I am there. And I mean, the volume probably slowed a little bit as of late with rates up, but there's probably a pretty decent clip. I mean, when we started this thing, I guess, I was thinking we\u2019d do about $500,000 a quarter and we've been running ahead of that because of where the rate environment has been. Yes so specifically, if you look, locking for our -- or sort of originating [ph] for our portfolio, locking for our portfolio was, in the third quarter, 9 \u2013 791. We did 680 in the fourth quarter, right, and so I think we're well above are target of $0.5 billion.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my final question, Ren\u00e9, is tangible book value was down a little bit because of the unrealized swing. I was wondering if you can just characterize what parts of the portfolio are you still seeing the spread widening in and how much of that portfolio, I guess, is still left, that's probably the, resulting in some of that OTTI that you booked this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay, separate -- let's just break those into 2 parts. So really, the drop that we saw in -- or the increase in our other comprehensive income was relative to the pension plan, which was lowering our discount rate by about one point, given where rates are, looking at sort of the user. Use a corporate bond yield. And look at that at the end of the year. So that was the big change. I think that was a change of almost $200 million pretax. So that's why that was down. When we look at our OTTI, I mean, we were just under $10 million last quarter; we're at $25 million this quarter. And I guess the way I would characterize that is as we kind of look out and look at the performance of the bonds and then, more importantly, think about the time horizon in which it will take for low rates to get better and for housing to get better. We sort of extended our outlook a little longer out on that basis. So not necessarily a change in the performance of the underlying bonds but a change in our outlook on how long it will -- the current environment will stay as it is today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, can you talk a little bit more about the drivers of loan growth this quarter, where you really saw some of the growth in the C&I book? And then also, can you give us a little bit of color around loan demand, where your line utilization is and also the trend in commitments?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, sure, sure. I'm happy to do that. We saw -- let me just give you some numbers. We saw, on the 6%, if you think about the average loan growth, the 6% up, we saw 5% growth in Upstate New York and Western New York. We saw, in our metro region, which is Philly, Westchester, New York metropolitan area, we saw 11% growth in total loans. And we saw a decline, a slight decline in PA and a decline of about 8% in the Mid-Atlantic. In the Mid-Atlantic, that was sort of funding of construction loans, which kind of went -- actually, after having funded construction loans, they moved over to permanent and we syndicated those out of our book. So we're collecting fees there, but generally, what's happening is we're kind of making sure we don't keep more than the amount of exposure that we want there. So activity in the Mid-Atlantic was pretty strong, as well. So if you kind of look at it, I'd say it's relatively across the board. We continue to be really encouraged by our performance in Upstate New York. We really do feel that we have an unprecedented opportunity to gain market share in upstate given the disruption that's gone on with, in particular with HSBC. That seems to be going very well. And then overall, I'd just say that there was a nice uptick in the activity. If you look at, exclude Wilmington, and you look from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year, I'd say we had about 4% growth, core growth, and the current trends and the activities feel a little bit more positive than they did a year ago. So those are my comments. I don't know if you have any other follow-up questions.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Well, just from the line utilization, do you have what it was for the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I haven't really looked at it, but it was up a bit; it ticked up a bit for the last 2 quarters.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then on TARP, can you -- I know you just mentioned that you obviously submitted under CCAR the capital plan. Can you talk to us about your updated thoughts about around the timing of the payment of your remaining slice of TARP?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","As we said before, we'll do it as soon as is practical and that\u2019s not something that sort of -- it involves others; it involves the Federal Reserve and so forth. So our objective would be to do it as soon as practical because we kind of view it a bit as a drain on our tangible generation. So that's our position; it hasn't really changed. I guess I'll leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, just along the lines of loan growth, could you talk about, with the resi mortgage loan growth, is that mostly arms? Or sort of what is the yield that you all are putting new loans on your books at?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","The yield is sort of at 4%, maybe a little below 4%, and it's a sort of a mix of 30- and 15-year. I'd say more than 1\/2 of that, maybe 60% of it, is 15-year agency mortgages.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just a quick question on credit. You mentioned the $19 million charge-off in the Mid-Atlantic. Was that fully reserved for or is some of this quarter's provision related to that credit?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We had a specific -- we had a specific reserve for that loan so there wasn't a big surprise with respect to it. And this is a portfolio -- I think, in fact, I think it's something that was from that original Mid-Atlantic portfolio that we've been talking about for several years, which is now down to, dare I say, de minimis amounts. I think I looked at the balances the other day and the on-balance sheet from that original -- of sort of Mid-Atlantic original portfolio was something like $170 million.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then sort of as we think about provisioning going forward, should we -- can we expect charge-offs and provision to sort of match as you work down specific reserves and then replace it as you think about provisioning for growth? Or net-net are you thinking you can release reserves or build? Or how are you thinking about it?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think it depends. I mean, if we didn't -- don't see an improvement in the overall economy and the levels of nonperforming criticized loans but we like the trends, right, but having said that, there's still very -- the levels are very abnormally high, at least for us. And until we see a significant change there, it would be hard just to think about taking down the allowance. Having said that, at the same time, we're booking a lot of loans, right? So when you put on $1.7 billion of new loans, you've got to provide for those as well. So I think our trend is -- when I look to the future, I look at what we've done in the past, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is clarity on the Tier 1 common ratio that you gave of 6.86%. That's on a Basel I basis?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you have what it would be on a Basel III basis?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. And again, I've said this before, sort of speculating on how the regulation is going to come out and what the rules of the game are going to be. We just haven't spent much time doing that so all of our -- you got it?","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. I guess my follow-up question to you is we're getting mixed messages in terms of what the regulators are looking at in the cap -- in CCAR for 2012. Some banks have told us that, \"Don't be so na\u00efve to think that Basel III doesn't matter,\" but it sounds like you submitted your capital plan, that it's, given what you said, we still don't know what the final rules are. Basel I will continue to be the focus for the regulators. Is it your sense that they're not looking at Basel III for those, for the capital plan for 2012?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, we just follow the rules. I mean, they've got a process. They tell you what to look for -- what to use, and we've gone through that process. And to the extent that we are required to go out and do something under a new set of rules, we would do that when the time comes. But it's just a lot of energy to be spending time trying to hit on what those prospective rules might come out to be. The other thing I think about is when we think about the capital planning here at M&T, we don't think about it any differently because we\u2019ve been asked to do a capital plan review than we\u2019ve done in the past. And I think it's kind of helpful to remember with M&T is why our capital ratios are where they are. We started out in the middle of a really poor economic environment in 2009 and we bought Provident and then we did a couple of FDIC-assisted deals and helped them out with another and then we bought Wilmington. And every single time that you go through that, you've got to be approved and so we submit plans and capital plans and, in several cases, stress tests and all that through the process. And if the regulators are comfortable with those plans then you move forward as it is. So when you look at that under a fair amount of scrutiny, what we've done is we've taken a lot of our capital generation and used it to support the stability of the banking industry by not letting those institutions kind of come down, and we brought them on as part of M&T. Our ability to generate capital, as you kind of look at that, is really, really high, right? So when we look at it, we've been through a lot of stress testing. We kind of took the same process and presented what we do in the same way. And from our perspective, we're not too concerned.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just my second question, I wanted to follow up on some of the guidance you gave on the expense side. If I'm looking at the number correctly, and please let me know if I'm looking at it incorrectly, excluding the -- some of the noise and excluding the intangible amortization expense, it looks like the quarterly run rate for expenses would be $603 million for the fourth quarter. And if I'm looking at an annualized rate of $2.4 billion in core expenses for 2012, how much is left to take out of that $2.4 billion number? And I'm wondering, because you mentioned there could still be 50% of cost saves remaining to realize from Wilmington Trust but you mentioned last quarter that there could still be reinvestment going into the legacy franchise that could be going on as well, how should we think about the puts and takes?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Numbers aside, the way you're thinking about it is exactly right. I mean, I just -- we've talked about -- initially, we talked about $80 million in expense saves from the Wilmington transaction. I don't know, maybe if you annualize the 13, we're up around 40 to 50, and I think we\u2019re 50% of the way there so we feel very, very good about that. And those are pretty much absolute numbers, but then you've got to bring them into M&T. And the way we think about M&T, particularly after receiving a lot of this pressure on fees and things from the regulation, is that we have to have a positive revenue expense spread. That means expenses will grow. We just want to make sure that they grow at a slower rate than the revenues. So I mean, I kind of look at the 2 separately, but when I look at it overall, expenses should be very well controlled in total as we kind of move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Adam Chaim - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Adam Chaim calling in for Matt. I just had a quick one on, I guess, the expenses in 4Q, the extraordinary expenses in 4Q. It looks like it's mostly sort of a clean-up quarter; I don't know if that's fair to say. But what do those impairment charges mean for securities, OTTI losses going forward, and also the Bayview run rate losses?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, with respect to the securities, you're -- what you're trying to do is you're trying to look out into the future and predict your cash flows. And to the extent that you think that you're going to have some credit impairment, you've got to take that and write those securities down to fair value. So if we've done that the right way and we don't see any change in the economic environment on a particular security, we think we've taken care of it. Having said that, in any quarter, you could get a different set of securities that could come up and you've got to look at them each quarter. With respect to the Bayview thing, remember that what we did this quarter takes down our basis, but the structure is such that our initial -- original investment, BLG or Bayview Lending Group, we have a 20% equity interest in, and in that particular piece, we use equity accounting so we record our share of the losses of that business. And while it's no longer originating a small-balance commercial security, it still has operating cost, is the best way to put it. And so I would expect very little change in what you've been seeing quarter over quarter there. The remaining -- most of the value that you have that supports our current market value is related to the parent company, Bayview Financial, and our 20% interest in all of it is cash flows. It's not 20% ownership but it's interest in the upside. And then in terms of cleanup, I don't -- that clean-up word is kind of weird to me, but it \u2013 it doesn't register with me so...","Adam Chaim - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just one other quick one on the trust income. Revenues were flat Q-over-Q. We thought that revenues might have seen a little bit of a bounce in 1Q. I think, in 3Q, you might have said that \u2013 you said that revenues were weak by I think $5 million to $8 million based on lower valuations and the equity markets. So when do we sort of start seeing a rebound there since we've seen an improvement in the financial markets? I know it's a temporary thing, but is that a related driver of that revenue?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I think what you're talking about there is all related to the trust and investment income. And then in that space, that's where the $5 million to $8 million was. We saw some of that come back. Fees and total trust fees were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and part of that was because of some of the uptick in market values. I think it might take a couple of quarters to get that back. Having said that, when you look at the underlying business, you've got to look at each of the components. And so for example, in the global capital markets portion of the business, Wilmington is the trustee for a lot of the securitizations that are out there. And so you get a lot of -- the uptick in revenue comes with a lot of issuances of debt and those types of thing. That market was -- dropped heavily in the third quarter. I think the amount of issuances were even lower on the fourth quarter and are some sort of record low for the last several years. So when that happens, their income is going to be down a little bit in that particular part of the business. I think, generally speaking overall, we'll -- we expect sort of modest growth. We're taking our time. And we think there's probably a lot of upside, but it's hard to predict exactly when that occurs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start, I wasn't clear on your answer to Erika's question: Should we now be modeling $100 million of cost saves from Wilmington?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I don't know. I mean, I think -- I feel like we're at about 1\/2 where we were so we're at least -- we at least got 1\/2 of the 40. We've done the work to get 1\/2 of the 40. Maybe it's a little higher. I'm just kind of looking at where we're running and I'd say we will probably have expense saves from Wilmington of -- that have been baked in and on an annual basis of $40 million to $50 million, and I think we're about halfway there.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. So we should take it up a bit, I'm assuming. Okay. In terms of the margin...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","A lot of moving parts in the whole expense space, you know.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. In terms of the margin, you said that prepaid fees declined. Can you break out what the dollars of prepaid fees were here in the fourth quarter so we know how much of that might be at risk in future quarters going away?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I'd rather not, but let me give you this context. I mean, it's a couple of million dollars, right, so a basis point is less than $1 million or something like that, right? So that's why you can kind of tell when it gets down to negligible amounts that that's not consistent, right?","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, Ren\u00e9, in terms of this excess liquidity, how do you think about the right amount of cash you should be holding? And are you expecting to move some of that into the securities portfolio to offset some of this margin pressure over the next few quarters?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think our securities -- let me think of a way to start on that. First of all, I think our securities book is probably one of the lowest among the regional banks, and the last I looked, we were probably half the size relative to our size of a securities book. And for the time being, we will continue to purchase security and hold mortgages so that probably would be a source of offset to the extent that we see continued growth in deposits and liquidity. But I feel -- in a very macro sense, I feel pretty good that we were able to take the $2.6 billion that we got from Wilmington. It took us 6 months, and to begin to utilize it. I would guess that the average balances, going forward, we typically don't carry that much cash.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But should we think of it that you continue to hold the liquidity or that you draw that down into the securities portfolio?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, what we did is we drew the -- we drew that down into liquid securities, right, so we're just, it means -- the word liquidity is interesting, right? As long as you're keeping high-quality securities, you're maintaining liquidity and you have that for future dates for whatever reason, right? But you're just earning money on it, as opposed to sitting -- having it sit with the Fed.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you, got you. Any thoughts on the operating expense side to offset margin pressure beyond Wilmington?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We're going to be very diligent on expenses. And it's hard to say, but I think the way we look at it, we'll probably talk about -- a little bit about it in our annual report. We've got a lot of work to do to offset sort of the changing banking environment because the rules of the game have changed. And so part of that is going to be focused on expense outside of what goes on with Wilmington. There will also be the other side. So what I'm talking about is the fact that we've got to have a much wider revenue expense grid than we've been running at in the past so efficiency is probably key for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at the 12 basis point decline in loan yields quarter-over-quarter, can you give us the impact between what was actually driven by spread, what was driven by rate, and if there\u2019s any derivative or swap impact?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","[indiscernible] No swap impact. Could you ask me that question in a different way?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. Most of the impact, I'm assuming, is from putting new loans on at lower yields, with higher loan -- high-yielding loans rolling off. So what is the impact from that, which is really spread? And the other impact was, for all your variable-rate loans, what was the impact in this shift in rates?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay. So I would say that if our core margin compression that I talked about was 4 basis points, I would say at least 1\/2 of that was volume of loan coming on probably a little bit more. Maybe a little bit is a result of -- if you look at the Wilmington book, it's got a higher mix of variable rates in that, and so when you bring that on, there was a little bit of margin compression from normal margin compression as well. So majority of the 4 basis points, in my mind, and the majority therefore of the 11 points in the asset side is going to be from the volume, but there is, I don't know, 1, 2, 3 basis points, 3, 4 basis points of the 11 that is just normal -- I would guess, is normal yield compression. Remember, when we talk about lower prepayment penalties and those things, that's also a component of the 11 basis points that you're looking at. And then finally, what I'll say is you can see the change in the book. Some of that is lower rates on deposits and time deposits running off. But I mean that -- I mean, I don't know, the deposit side, I wouldn't expect the change to trend -- to change dramatically.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then, Ren\u00e9, just one follow-up. If you look at your pretty strong loan growth from last quarter and assumed, and I don't want to be too short-term focused here, but assumed that the first quarter ended last Friday and you annualized that. I'm just wondering how is loan demand trending in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter? And can you also discuss any expected seasonality?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I don't know. I mean, I think the activity seems to have picked up. Let's go back. We had actually a pretty robust quarter a year ago. And that tailed in -- last year, that tailed into January and February and then it got a little quiet. And then of course, with the downgrade of the U.S. and Europe falling off the charts, everything seemed to get very quiet. I think that really affected our third quarter. Having said that, in the third quarter of this year, even though our balances were low, we saw a lot of underlying demand and a lot of that materialized over the last, say, 4 months of the year. And so it's hard to predict what will happen, but I do kind of feel like it's sort of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from where we were last year. And if we can get some stability out there, then maybe that'll all translate into sort of an uptick in the total level of year-over-year loan growth. But I mean, given what happened last year, I feel very -- pretty comfortable with that. What we were able to do last year, we should be able to do again this year, and that's kind of how I look at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management.","John D.

So we're more than happy to help everybody with their liquidity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just want to follow up -- you've seen a lot of these things, but just on the loan yield side as we look at kind of the differentiation between what's rolling off and what you're putting on. I know you said it's lower. Can you quantify sort of how much lower? And I'm just trying to reconcile when that churn really starts to slow because you guys already seem like you're sitting in a fairly low kind of weighted average loan yield, anyway, and I would just think you're probably closer to a bottoming then. And maybe that's what you mean on your margin comment, but just trying to reconcile those numbers a little bit more.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I mean, okay, I, one, I don't think I can quantify it. I'll think about it, and if we decide to do some more, then we'll disclose it in -- somewhere in our Q and so forth. But the way I think about it is, if you think about last quarter, the linked quarter, we actually had some uptick in our loan yields, right, and that was because we had higher prepayment and non-accrual interest on those loans. And my sense is that they would have been flat to slightly down the previous quarter, as well. And then, that trend would have continued this quarter. This quarter, you had a flip in those sort of cash items, right? And I don't, off the top of my mind, know, is that like maybe 3. Give me one second. Maybe 2 to 3 basis points, 4 basis points on the loan yields; maybe that's the 4 that I talked about. And then \u2013 but, so that would leave you with something like 7 to 8 and a lot of that, I think, was a little abnormally high because we had so much volume of loan and securities on our books. So there's a natural number in there. I haven't really quantified exactly what that natural number is.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just on the -- just a little bit of color on the loan side, the loan growth that you're seeing. I know you broke it out geographically, but do you have a sense at all of what types of businesses are borrowing and where you're seeing the demand just from a kind of an economic sector standpoint?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, yes. Well, I mean, we saw -- I saw \u2013 I take a look at by stick code [ph] and all that. I mean, there's really no one particular trend. We -- it seems to be in all types of commercial customers. We did have, as we spelled out in our press release, the fact that we got a rebound in the inventories on the auto floor plan, right, but aside from that, you can't really see -- I mean, in the real estate world, you saw that come back. For the first time, we've been running slightly down. I think all the activity was there, but probably the runoff of the book, remember, we've got Wilmington in there, has slowed. But there's no specific spike. I mean, I would say we've got growth in a lot of categories. The other thing I'd point out is that, since the acquisition, the Wilmington loan book has actually been coming down, but we saw -- even in Delaware, we saw C&I grow for 4 consecutive months, right, for the first time so that turned. And in total, the amount of runoff that we've seen in that book has actually slowed a bit. So there's some encouraging signs and it would be nice to have a quarter where every one of the regions has grown. And that's not happened yet, but I think the trend is headed in the right direction.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, just curious, and maybe it was your comments about your outlook just being cautious as to the timeline that we're sitting -- going to sit in this environment, but why now did you change your course on Bayview? I mean, for years, you guys have been badgered on this line item. I just am curious why now you opted to pull the trigger.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I mean, you kind of got to go back, right? So other-than-temporary impairment requires a view that says over the passage of time, if something stays below its fair value for a long period of time, you've got to really think hard about saying that that's not other-than -- that\u2019s not a temporary decline. And so if you think about what happened over time, in 2008, Bayview, BLG, stopped doing its origination of loans, and then what we did in 2008 is we restructured that investment so that we received an interest on all the cash flows of parent, Bayview Financial. And if you look at where we are today, much of the valuation that we have today is based on the sort of asset management business. If you kind of go back to our Q, when we were extending out our view of our ability to sort of collect our book value, all of our calculations said that, in our estimates, that our present value of the cash flows that we thought we would be able to collect were about 106% of the book value of our investment. What's kind of changed, is as you kind of think about, is -- what's changed really is our thinking about that timing. And so as you think about the business that they're in, Bayview's asset management business is a business which sort of manages capital for investors in the distressed mortgage space through either asset purchases or through servicing. And what I guess we would say is it's kind of ironic in a sense because what we like is the prudence at which they seem to be managing that business. And what that means is that, when asset prices or servicing prices are high, they chose not to deploy a lot of money so that they could keep their returns high. And as opportunities and prices drop and they think they're fair, they have the ability to grow assets under management by deploying that cash much faster. If you kind of just think about that discipline, what it says to us is that if they keep doing that, the business is actually growing, it's doing well but our ability to predict the timing, sort of schedule out the timing of when we'd receive those cash flows is less. So as we kind of looked at it, we were somewhere around, our cash flows, we suggested were sort of somewhere in and around the book value, and we said, \"Look, what's our ability to really predict the timing to a great degree of accuracy?\" So we decided to sort of take a look at the fair value and write it down to fair value at that time, which is what's required with an OTTI analysis. So really, the underlying business, we see a lot of growth and a lot of favorable things that are going on, but what's really changed is our view of the timing of when we'd be able to recover the investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Sorry to kind of beat the dead horse, but just a follow-up to earlier questions, what's kind of your average loan yield on C&I loans in the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Give me 2 seconds and I'll give you that. In total, we were somewhere around -- average loan yield was 378.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, for consolidated all products or just C&I?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","C&I.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. How does that compare -- I mean, the Fed survey shows it's around 2.5. I mean, what's the main, I guess, discrepancy? I know you historically have very low losses, just how you're getting over 100 basis points more than kind of the industry norm.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, let me -- give me a second; let me give you some sense [ph]. If you look at how we manage the business, one, I think, if there's a difference, we're not doing a lot of large, syndicated credits with investment-grade companies, right? And I think that's how you would get margins, I would say or yields that are that much lower on your C&I book. But to give you some sense: If you look at a spread from swaps, our margins are routinely in the -- above 3% on the businesses that we actually bank, which a lot of which are smaller, small businesses and middle-market companies so we're something like the sixth-largest SBA lender in the U.S. ; third-largest east of the Mississippi, all right? So we're banking much smaller business credit. The one thing I would say is that, it's interesting, what you see when you look at the volume of business that we do, over the last 4 or 5 quarters, the margin has held up steady, right, in and around 3%; slightly higher when you look at it relative to the swaps curve. And so I think, really, when you think of the bank's margin, what's really happening is banks have hit a floor on the deposit side. And -- but when you look at the underlying business, if we're booking it at an appropriate spread, there really tends to be quite a bit of upside if the interest rate environment were to be -- were to normalize. So I'm not sure, I mean, the C&I spread, that seems really, really low for the type of business we would be in. So I don't know exactly what everybody else would be doing.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So the 378 look like actually the rate for the average for the quarter, but you're saying what you originated is still -- are you saying it's in the ballpark of the, what's on the books right now?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","If you look at what we originated in the last 2 quarters, it's just above 3% relative to the swap rates. So maybe, I don't know, what is that, 323, 325, 330, somewhere in that range, yield.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim securities.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's more of a concept of, on the earlier question about the Basel III. When we do the calculation, we put all the enterprise-wide risk into our models. M&T Bank actually doesn't have much of an adjustment. All I was getting at is because you don't and because of the great risk management that you've had in the past, there is not much of an adjustment between Basel I and Basel III so really, there's not the haircut that you see in all the other banks, which would make it so important for them to do the calculation versus you-all being able to equate at least without any unknown changes, that you're pretty much in line with where Basel III would be.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I like what you're saying. I just, my problem is I don't -- thank you very much.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm just saying, in general, the risk management practice has limited the impact of Basel III. So that way, your capital plan can kind of get away without having to formally calculate that.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think it's very, very important that capital management's got to be above capital and risk.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just going to put that out there so you kind of reconcile a lot of other banks are probably having to have more emphasis on that.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thanks, Marty.","Operator","That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. MacLeod for any closing remarks.","Donald J.

This is Don MacLeod. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As I noted in the press release, M&T's profit softened during the recent quarter as compared with the previous quarter. This reflects the impact from -- the impact to M&T from the industry-wide slowdown in mortgage banking activity, as well as higher operating expense, arising from our investments in risk management, capital planning and stress testing, regulatory compliance and technology and operating infrastructure. I'll cover more details on these investments in a moment. The recent quarter was also marked by continued strengthening of our Tier 1 common capital ratio, which increased by 52 basis points to 9.07%. Let me first review a few of the highlights from the quarter's results, after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions.","Turning to specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.11 in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $2.55 in this year's second quarter and $2.17 in last year's third quarter. Net income for the recent quarter was $294 million compared with $348 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $293 million in the third quarter of 2012. During the period, we completed the remainder of our actions initiated to strengthen our capital and liquidity position in an efficient -- in the most efficient manner. We converted some $1 billion of FHA loans on our balance sheet into Ginnie Mae securities, which we retained in our investment portfolio. In addition, we securitized and sold $1.4 billion of capital intensive lower returns indirect auto loans. These transactions generated $56 million of pretax securitization gains, which contributed $34 million to net income for the quarter or $0.26 per common share.","You will recall that M&T's results for the second quarter included net pretax gains on the sale of investment securities amounting to $56 million. Also, during the second quarter, we reversed an accrual amounting to $26 million pretax for a contingent compensation obligation assumed in the Wilmington Trust merger, and which had expired. Taken together, those items contributed $50 million after tax to net income for the second quarter or $0.38 per common share. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $6 million or $0.05 per common share during the third quarter compared with $8 million or $0.06 per share in the prior quarter. There were no merger-related expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2013. In the second quarter, merger-related expenses amounted to $5 million after-tax effect or $0.04 per common share. M&T's net operating income for the quarter, which excludes amortization -- intangible amortization and merger-related expenses was $301 million compared with $361 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share -- per common share were $2.15 for the recent quarter compared with $2.65 in the linked quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder's equity of 1.48% and 17.64% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.81% and 22.72% in the second quarter 2013. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $679 million for the third quarter of 2013, down by $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.61% during the third quarter compared with 3.71% in the second quarter. The narrowing of the net interest margin was largely the result of a $13 million decline in prepayment fees and interest on non-accrual loans. This accounted for 7 basis points of the decline in margin. The remaining 3 basis points of the decline reflects the core margin pressure that we've been projecting for some time and that we continue to expect to unfold over the course of the year -- over the course of the next year. The higher level of earnings assets would have been sufficient to grow net interest income despite core margin pressure, were it not for the return to normal levels of prepayment fees and cash basis interest. As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets grew by an annualized 4% or about $700 million from the second quarter. This included a $1.7 billion increase in average investment securities and a $1.1 billion decline in average loans, both of which reflect the securitization activity, primarily the FHA securitization that I mentioned earlier.","In addition to these securities -- to the securities retained through the securitization of FHA loan, we purchased an additional $1.6 billion of Ginnie Mae securities in the open market over the course of the third quarter, essentially reinvesting the proceeds from our second quarter sale of private label securities and the late third quarter securitization and sale of indirect auto loans. On an end of period basis, investment securities were $8.3 billion as of September 30. After annualizing for the securitizations, growth in average loans for the quarter was an annualized 1%. Average commercial & industrial loans grew by 2% annualized. That growth was muted by the typical seasonal slowdown in floor plan loans, which declined by almost $100 million. Excluding floor plan, C&I loan growth was 5% annualized, slightly lower than what we've been seeing over the past several quarters. Average commercial real estate loans grew an annualized 1%. Adjusted for the securitizations, average residential real estate loans declined an annualized 5%. The $1.4 billion auto loan securitization did not have a significant impact on average consumer loans, as it was completed in late September. However, adjusting for that securitization, consumer loans grew an annualized 2%. Despite pricing pressures, M&T's commercial loan origination has been consistent quarter-over-quarter. However, refinancing activity has driven the apparent slower rate of loan growth.","From a regional perspective, upstate in Western New York continues to be our strongest reason for loan growth. The average total loans in that region grew by an annualized 5% compared with the linked quarter, while the average C&I loans grew by an annualized 8%. Our Metro region, which includes New York City and Albany area and Philadelphia was just behind that with annualized growth in total loans of about 4% and annualized C&I growth of about 12%. The mid-Atlantic, including Baltimore, Washington and Delaware, continues to experience the softest loan growth, with high single-digit annualized declines in C&I and CRE, as well as total loans. This region is where we're seeing the most competition, particularly with respect to pricing and structure.","Average core customer deposits, which excludes deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, grew an annualized 3% from the second quarter. From an end of period basis, core deposits grew an annualized 6%. We continue to maintain a high level of excess funds at the fed, amounting to $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter. The average balance for the quarter continue to reflect the high level of deposits by institutional trust customers early in the quarter and included the portion of the proceeds from the auto securitization that occurred later in the quarter.","Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $477 million in the third quarter compared with $509 million in the prior quarter. The quarter -- this quarter's figures includes the $56 million in securitization gains I referred to earlier, while the second quarter figure includes $56 million of net gains on the sale of investment securities.","Mortgage banking revenues declined to $65 million in the recent quarter compared with $91 million in the prior quarter. This includes 3 components. Residential gain on sale revenues were $17 million for the third quarter, a decline of $23 million from the second quarter. The residential origination volumes declined by 41% from the second quarter to $1.1 billion, while residential gain on sale margins declined by 48 basis points. On the commercial side of mortgage banking, gain on sale revenues declined by $11 million, returning to more normalized levels after a record second quarter.","Residential mortgage servicing revenues grew by $7 million to $30 million in the third quarter. The increase reflects about 1 month of revenue from the subservicing contract that we entered into during the quarter. We expect to see in the neighborhood of $15 million of additional servicing fees in the fourth quarter as the revenue from that contract reaches its full running rate. Fee income from deposit services provided were $114 million during the third quarter compared with $112 million in the linked quarter. Trust and investment revenues were $124 million, a little change from $125 million in the prior quarter. The second quarter results benefited from the normal seasonal uptick in tax preparation fees.","Turning to expenses. While we've noted the expected ramp up in expenses for some time now, the full impact of those investments in risk management, capital planning and stress testing, regulatory compliance and technology and operating infrastructure became particularly apparent in this quarter's results. Operating expenses, which excludes merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible expense, were $648 million for the third quarter compared with $578 million in the second quarter. The linked quarter variance includes the $26 million accrual reversal in the second quarter that I mentioned previously, as well as an increase of $44 million in operating expenses. Contributing to that increase was a $16 million rise in salaries and benefits. That was largely attributable to, first, the $7 million related to approximately 500 FTEs brought on board for the subservicing contract at the outset of the third quarter. Next, $4 million attributed to an extra compensation day in the quarter, and then $2 million reflecting the ramp-up in staffing related to our BSA\/AML and capital planning and stress testing initiatives, including some 200 FTEs. Also contributing to the linked quarter increase was an $18 million increase in professional services, largely attributable to $7 million spent for specialized consulting services related to BSA\/AML, $6 million of additional spending on certain technology-related investments, as well as our risk infrastructure and $1 million related to the subservicing contract.","Looking -- if you were to look at expenses on a year-over-year basis, the $46 million increase, as compared to last year's third quarter, is characterized as follows. About 37% of the increase in expense is a result of our regulatory compliance initiatives, BSA\/AML capital planning and stress testing, including some 250 additional FTEs. Approximately 24% of the year-over-year rise is accounted for by the subservicing contract. And finally, you will recall that the staff -- you will recall that the staffing hired for our New Jersey initiative during the first 4 months of this year drove about 20% of the increase, including some additional 175 FTEs. We hope you find this detail helpful. The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization and the merger revenue expenses was 56.0% for the third quarter compared with 50.9% in the prior quarter. Excluding the reversal of the Wilmington Trust accrual, the efficiency ratio would've been about 53.2% in the second quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remained strong and in line with our expectations. Nonaccrual loans declined $49 million from the end of the second quarter, and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined by 2 basis points to 1.44% as of the end of the third quarter. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $48 million compared with $57 million in the second quarter. Annualized net charge-offs, as a percent of total loans, were 29 basis points for the third quarter and the year-to-date. The comparable figure was 35 basis points for the second quarter. The revision for credit losses was $48 million for the third quarter, which equaled the net charge-offs. Reflected in the aforementioned gain, resulting from the securitization and sale of the $1.4 billion of auto loans, was an associated reserve release of $11 million. The net effect was a decline in the allowance for credit losses to $916 million as of the end of the third quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit losses for total loans increased to 1.44% at the end of September 30 from 1.41% at the end of the prior quarter. The loan-loss allowance, as of September 30, 2013, was 4.8x annualized net charge-offs for both the recent quarter and the year-to-date.","Loans 90 days past due, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition, was $340 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $321 million or 94% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Loans 90 days past due were also $340 million at the end of the second quarter, of which 93% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","M&T's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 9.07% at the end of September, up 52 basis points from 8.55% at the end of the second quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the recently adopted Basel III capital rules is approximately 8.75%. The Tier 1 common ratio has increased by some 161 basis points since the third quarter of 2012, while our tangible common equity has grown by $1.1 billion or a 20% increase.","Turning to the outlook. We continue to see the potential for an estimated 3 basis points of quarterly core margin pressure. The reported net interest margin will continue to be impacted by the levels of excess cash held at the Fed. Despite the slower loan growth during the quarter, our outlook for loan growth remains relatively unchanged. In addition, we may continue to purchase investment securities to round out our liquidity asset buffer.","At this point in time, assuming that interest rates stay where they are, some continued modest softness in mortgage origination seems likely. As noted, as revenues from the subservicing contract reach their full run rate in the fourth quarter, we effectively have a cushion against further declines in total mortgage banking income. And with respect to credit, our year-over-year charge-offs of just 29 basis points are below our long-term average of 37 basis points, and we would expect to report a slight increase in criticized assets in our upcoming 10-Q. Stated simply, credit quality remains strong.","Turning to expenses. We estimate that our current outside level of spending will likely remain elevated for the next several quarters. As a management team, we've concluded that to the extent that we can make the necessary investments and strengthen our infrastructure now, it will position us well to sustain our long-term record of relative outperformance. With respect to capital, we've exceeded the 9% threshold for our Tier 1 common capital ratio under the Basel I rules, and as we said, our current estimate is 8.75% under Basel III and we plan to continue to build capital over the near term. As you know, I am not at liberty to discuss the details of our regulatory matters, but by way of an update on the BSA\/AML matter, we believe the progress to date has been considerable. And while we have a lot of work left to do, we continue to work diligently to create a high-quality BSA compliance program that fully addresses the concerns raised in the written agreement with the Federal Reserve. Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national, regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","With that, let's open up the call to questions, before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to clarify on the NIM outlook of down around 3 basis points per quarter, is that off of the 3.61% that we saw this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's an interesting question. I guess, the way I look at it, Matt, is I look at it a couple of ways. So if you think about -- if you were to go back to the first quarter, I think we were 3.71% in the first quarter. So we're also down 10 over the 6 months, and there's probably 2 basis points of day [ph] effect -- there's actually some effect of cash. So if you look at the underlying trend, we're coming down about 3 basis points. So it's hard to answer your question because it depends on the level of cash, where your starting point is. The other way I look at it is assuming cash, and obviously days over time are the same. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we were down 16 basis points, and 11 of that was the -- about a $2.4 billion increase in cash. So we only had about 5 basis points of compression. I think that really reflects the 3 basis points we've been talking about, offset by the fact that our acquired loan portfolios had been performing better. So you're going to have to pick your number, but I don't think of it as off any particular number because it gets reset with the cash balances. Is that helpful?","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It is. And I guess what I was getting at is the prepayments fees coming down. Would you consider this quarter kind of a bit more typical in how those fees are or were [indiscernible]?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, very typical, very typical. I mean, as I kind of look back over the last -- I don't know, I just glanced at the last 6, 7 quarters. The numbers are between $7 million and $9 million. So this quarter was $9 million. The aberration was just last quarter was up 13 from that.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, obviously, the mortgage banking business for the industry is going through a pretty sizable correction both on volumes and on the profitability, as we think about the gain on sale. Has your thought process in terms of the mortgage banking business medium and longer term, changed at all in terms of -- obviously, your pending deal, you're going to build out the agency mortgage business there. Anything that you're seeing for the environment overall changing how you think about sizing that and the strategic importance of all that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I mean, the one thing that we see that's on our minds, and we've kind of made some stake in the ground, I guess, on it. But if you go way back before the crisis and before the new structure and the higher requirements, including -- and then including the put back fees and those types of things. People were happy getting gain on sales between 80 and 100 basis points, and the big issue for us is that the business cannot support those lower levels of gain on sale. So you kind of have to hit a floor and pick that target. The big question will be is whether the rest of the industry actually adheres to that. But as you know, we tend to focus on profitability. And at least for the last 30 years or so, we've been able to avoid chasing all that stuff. So I think that's the big question that's out there for me is are people are going to behave rationally. We've had gain on sale margins come down somewhere around to about 200 basis points now. And I'm not sure that they can go all that much lower and have it make a lot of sense to be in that -- to do a lot of volume in that business, but that's the big change that we're grappling with, and so far, it seems to be holding up fine around those levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just, I guess, a little question on the competition within the loan market. You mentioned that the mid-Atlantic is the most competitive among your 3 regions. I guess, I'm curious as to within the competition among the other 2 areas, has that competition gotten tougher and are there deals, more deals now that you're potentially walking away from due to either pricing or structure than there might have been 3 to 6 months ago?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Everywhere or outside of the mid-Atlantic?","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was actually speaking specifically outside the mid-Atlantic.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Outside the mid-Atlantic. Yes, I mean, there's levels of pricing pressures across the board, and I -- outside the mid-Atlantic because, there, it's just -- it's significantly different. And you can kind of see that in my comments around the volume, which are declining, because in the mid-Atlantic, just as a background, I mean, there's a point at which we're not really hitting our risk return levels, and we just can't use the balance sheet for that purpose. So for some time, it was the life companies. I think I've talked about that for a while, but now, you've seen the banks join in -- several banks join in on that. But if you look at the other areas, each of them is a little bit different. And if I think of like, I work my way up, I work my way north on the map, you got -- in Pennsylvania, in the sort of central Pennsylvania, maybe Harrisburg area, we talked to our customers. Their expectations for the loan growth is relatively soft. They're not -- they're really hesitant to do anything on the CapEx front. They also have a lot of -- how should I say it, low confidence in sort of the economic recovery. So they're not doing a lot of hiring, and so what that results in is there's just not a lot of activity, but there's a lot of folks actually going after the transactions. So what we're seeing in that particular market is a willingness to -- for people to take on -- what's probably more important than the pricing pressure there is the willingness to take on the whole credit or larger chunks of credit by smaller institutions, and so that affects loan growth. So as you know, I mean, if you have a granular portfolio, you're going to be less lumpy. If it goes the other way, you're going to have more risks. If you look at smack in central Pennsylvania, there's been actually a little bit of a rebound from the Marcellus shale. But again, not enough to drive what we're seeing around pricing and structure in that case. But then as you flip your way up to most of upstate New York, and our definition of upstate New York, we have 5 communities, all 5 communities have loan growth. I would say by historical measures, pricing has got a slight downward trend, but volumes have held up fairly well, and I can't tell you exactly what that is. There's a manufacturing base up here, and people seem to be a little bit more willing to make investments. And I think your competition is different. Because of the number of banks, you actually choose not to bank up here. So that's the landscape. I mean, I would say that over the last 3 quarters, the pricing issue in any one quarter wasn't all that noticeably more, but now it feels like it's gotten pretty heavy. So hopefully that helps.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Just a couple of questions on expenses. You mentioned that those are likely to be elevated for a number of quarters into the future. And I guess, specifically on the FTEs that were added for the servicing portfolio, is it your expectation that those will remain relatively static to the number of FTEs you on-boarded? Or do those come down over time, therefore, reducing the potential expense related to that revenue?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, on servicing, those are -- I mean, those are tightly managed around the level of the servicing portfolio. And so we have about an $81 billion servicing portfolio until we're properly staffed for it. If that were to run down over time, you wouldn't need as many staffing, but it depends on sort of what comes on the opportunity side there. That's pretty steady.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, fair enough. And then on the BSA\/AML compliance cost, it looks from your comments that you're running at an annualized rate. Round number's about $60 million a year for those. Any sense as to how long that might continue? And once you get this investment done, presumably you're largely over with that, is that a 1 or 2-year timeframe or is that longer?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, Matt, I can only comment about -- I comment about all of the stuff because I think what we've decided is that -- and we decided this some time ago, that it doesn't make sense to take a long time to make all these investments. The regulatory environment is changing. The operating environment is changing as well. So we figured we would accelerate those changes and try to get a bulk of work done. We saw this before -- we've seen this before. We sought after each of our areas of expansion in the early '90s, and then, again, after the all first period. And now we're seeing it again after we've gone through several acquisitions in about a 5-year period of growth. What's different this time is we're just deciding to look at the whole thing together. So I think that makes the expense naturally higher. With respect to BSA, at some point, there is a natural level of staffing that's going to make us -- how do I say this, have a state-of-the-art program and -- but that will level out, but it will take some time for each of those things to happen. That's why I said, over the next several quarters, we think it's going to be relatively elevated so -- and then from there, each piece is different. So CCAR is different. BSA is different. Overall risk management structure, a different animal as well. So as the expenses come down, that will -- it won't all happen at once.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Murray of ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the BSA\/AML. You're talking in the next several quarters. I mean, how -- what inning would you describe [indiscernible] or sort of what percentage of the way you think you're there on that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's a great question. I don't know. So you end up with an issue, a weakness in your program, but then the reality is that it's not likely just go fix your weakness. You actually have to -- you have to think about it in a way of building the state-of-the-art, best-in-the-industry practices, in part because the -- of all trillions of dollars of illicit activity that ends up going through the banking system, those folks are ramping up their efforts to try to figure out new ways to get around you. So at the end of the day, we're revamping our whole process and that takes a fair amount of time. The real question becomes when do you get enough of it done so that you actually have confidence in your own process so that your board has confidence in it as well as the regulators having confidence in it, and there's no answer to that question. You just work hard and you figure out how to keep on course for making sure you have a high-quality product as opposed to trying to get it done too quickly.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then let's assume, for argument's sake, that the deal with Hudson City closes in January. How long do you think it will take to get that franchise sort of set up the way that you guys want it to be? Is that 1-year or 2-year build?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","First, I'd say -- first thing I'll say is we haven't spent any time thinking about Hudson City lately. We've been really focused on the things that I've just talked about. But I mean, if you look at any transaction, we've got a pretty strong track record of how long it takes to do something like that. Wilmington Trust took a lot longer because it was a different animal. And if you're putting together a thrip sort of regardless of size, you would be -- it would be very short order. And what you'd have to do is kind of go back and talk to a few folks about what's pretty well-documented about what we've done in the past, but today, we're not -- this is not what we're focused on. We've got -- our eyes are all focused on the regulatory matters at hand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So I mean I hate to kind of beat on the expense side again, but I guess when I [indiscernible].","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","You like [indiscernible].","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","What was that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","You like expenses, I know you.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I know, I'm sorry about this. So the cash expenses","in the quarter, right, $648 million, and you mentioned with the previous questions that, obviously, a lot of the expenditure is BSA\/AML, the CCAR and regulatory-related stuff that's going to stick around for a while. I guess is that -- is there anything in there though that we could start seeing some small savings coming out? Or do you think that around this kind of cash basis, somewhere around $650 million is where that's going to be on the next couple of quarters?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay, that's a great question. So I think it's 2 things, 2 things. First of all, because of the earlier question and the fact that we're trying to do -- we're trying to get a lot done relatively quickly, we're using a lot of outside services. So I mean, that and you can pick your time horizon for how long you're off and running on your own. So quite frankly, a lot of the requirements under CCAR and those things are that you actually -- you're not really in a solid position unless you are doing all that stuff on your own. To us, that's a shorter time frame. I don't think we're going to see much of a reduction in the next couple of quarters, but you can see where you'd see some benefits and not necessarily having all that outside services helping you as you stabilize your processes. But the flip side is, as you think about it, and we think about the total expense base, if you look back to times when we had decline in mortgage volume, we tend to focus very heavily on rightsizing and rationalizing the mortgage business. But in the way M&T works, you actually tend to look at the entire bank. And what is logical that will need to happen over some time, we're still scoping it all out, is that while we're spending a lot more on regulatory compliance and the control structure is that we're going to have to begin to rationalize the expenses in other areas, right? So in terms of is $648 million our forever run rate? No, not at all, nor is 56% or 58% efficiency ratio. That doesn't make sense much to us. But we've been at this in attacking it so directly, that we haven't spent much time rationalizing. We've just been spending time building, right? So there will come a time -- not that far away, where we will be able to begin to think about where we can manage the expenses a little bit better. $648 million is not a run rate.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Right, I didn't think so, but thanks for the extra color on that. And maybe just to go back to another question on the NIM as a follow-up here. You talked about prepayment penalties. Can you tell us what happened, I guess, on the accretable yield because the prepayment income you're talking about is obviously prepayment on loans and not -- you're not talking about the accretable yield on that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, again, accretable -- let me just tell you, the total interest income on the $4.7 billion of acquired loans that we have was $71 million, I think. The last quarter, it was $77 million. Looked at another way, we had 15 basis points of lift in our yield last quarter from the acquired portfolio. We have 14 basis points this quarter, right? So you can kind of see that, that's embedded into the 3 basis points of margin for us that we've been talking about, and that 14 basis points of lift that we have will go away as those loans pay down.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I guess if I can take one other shot at it, then I'll get back in the queue. I guess you talked about not being really focused on Hudson City today because, obviously, getting through BSA and CCAR are primarily the biggest things you're focused on, but really -- I mean, should I take that to mean that you really can't think about Hudson City until you get the BSA and AML issues behind you?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, yes, that's what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing, right? I mean, we're focused on the pool bank first, and we're going to get that done, and we're going to do it right. And then from there, we'll see what we do with the expansion plans, right? I think that's the most effective way to approach it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question on your expense outlook in context of the broader efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio has clearly creeped up year-over-year. And as we think about the next few quarters, if expenses stay elevated, is there enough revenue lift somewhere to take the efficiency ratio down from the 56% that you posted this quarter or until we see some rightsizing of the regulatory-related expense, it's going to stay at the 56% level?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, I think same answer. For several quarters, our expenses and therefore, our efficiency ratio is going to be elevated. The thing I would say, Erika, is it's not necessarily and probably not likely a rightsizing of regulatory expenses. It's the rightsizing of everything else because the regulatory environment is not like a couple of weeks. It's a total change in the industry, and you've got to have a different infrastructure. So most of our savings are going to come from other areas, and we'll probably have increased spending on -- even from where we are on compliance and infrastructure around risk.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my second question has to do with potential growth of your balance sheet. Do you expect to plow -- just plow the excess deposits into your bond portfolio if loan growth continues to be sort of where your outlook is or rather deposit growth continues to outpace loan growth? Or do you expect to lever the balance sheet some to increase your securities as a percentage of your earning assets?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","The way I would say it is, as always, we're profitable enough to be patient. So we are not done with our liquid asset buffer. We did a lot -- as you saw, we did a lot of work when rates popped up, and we were able to get the government-backed securities at the rates of about 3.25%. Those yields have backed off, but our plan is to keep doing that, and particularly, if there's any increase in rates, we'd probably dive in and do more of that. But once we're at a steady state in terms of, for example, our liquidity coverage ratio, then I think the answer really is, is we're only going to do loans if they make profitable sense because we don't really want to weaken our balance sheet, and our history around securities is the same thing. So it will be quite interesting because, really, what you're seeing on the cash balances is that consumers and businesses are just uncomfortable spending. So it's all the same issue. But what tends to happen at M&T is we end up with fairly slow revenue growth, but a decent return and a healthy balance sheet. That is becoming more and more of a concern to me when I look what's the stories I'm getting out of the field and the different regions around pricing and structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just the first question, just -- with regarding net interest income, hearing your point about a little bit of coordinating pressure, it seemed like the period end -- there's a lot of moving parts this quarter, so with the loans and securities, securitizations, whatnot. So I just want to understand, I think period end balances for earning assets look a decent amount higher than earning assets. So are we at the point where we can expect NII to resume growth from here?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I think that's kind of what I was trying to say in my comments. If you take away the swing in the prepayment fees, we would have had profit growth of $7 million, $8 million, linked quarter, and that's because of all the additional investment securities mostly. So I think that's right. That's what you'll see. You got some momentum going into the quarter. And then from a margin perspective, those are costing us a bit, right? In terms of a net interest margin percentage, they're coming down, it's coming down a bit, other than the fact that we're using cash. So it depends what happens to those cash balances again. But the way we look at it is that actually puts some slight margin pressure on you, but I still think, as I look at it, we probably have growth [indiscernible].","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it, right, driven by earning asset growth.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","On the mortgage banking side, I just wanted to clarify something. You talked about the $15 million incremental fees from the servicing deal and you talked about expected weakness on what I think was the resi side. Are you saying that you expect those to pretty much offset each other?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I would love to say on the residential side that things have stabilized. But because I've only seen 2 months of it, I'm a little nervous, but I wouldn't -- I would expect a decline in resi mortgage probably to be smaller than the lift from -- but it's been early. It was such a quick ramp down, but I'm thinking that the servicing increase probably should readily offset the other side, but hard to say, right?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then on the cost side of just mortgage again. Related to the servicing deal, were those costs already run-rated in the third quarter so we'll see the fee benefit in the fourth, but do we get an incremental cost side increase related to the servicing acquisition?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No, not material -- so yes, you're right, those expenses were there at the outset of the quarter. They were there around July 1.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last, last thing for me just regarding -- you did a lot of these securitizations and capital kind of benefit type of transactions this quarter. Do you anticipate doing much more of that? Or did you kind of take care of a lot of the shifting those several transactions in the third? How are you thinking about balance sheet efficiency and mix going forward?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We -- what I would categorize it as, Ken, is we did most of what the repositioning of things that were on our balance sheet. What we have left to do is maybe some issuance of unsecured debt and maybe some more purchases of liquid securities to invest that in. Maybe in the near term, we're on a program to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Sort of following along that line of thinking, should we think about the securitizations this quarter as sort of steps being taken right now to reposition the balance sheet or will auto securitization be an ongoing piece of your revenue stream?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's exactly what we're talking about right now. I mean, one of the things that we found when we kicked this off was that the appetite for yield was so high that it made the transaction work. But having said that, at least, in my history, it's an indirect auto loan, you can't get a return on your book. It's hard to get a return by selling it to somebody else. So we're thinking about that. And we'll probably be in much more of a flow-oriented program, because a lot of times, the appetite for that product is a little bit different than our own appetite just because we have different cost of capital or different return requirements. So more, but we haven't got there yet, but we're thinking about that.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then as you think about that, would the thought process be to securitize every quarter or a couple of times a year? Or how do you think about sort of the ebb and flow of originate and sale?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, we're just building an infrastructure. So I don't know we would do enough volume to be doing it anyway near it. I mean, once in a great while, at this point, I think, is probably the answer. The other thing is, if you're going to do that, Bob, you would see it right away because we would have to originate those for sale, right? So unless you see it's actually reclassifying those loans as we book them on, we're not there yet to be able to do something like that.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then one last question on expenses. I know you've talked a lot about sort of how they're going to be elevated. Is the build out done, though? I mean, do they remain elevated at these levels? Or are there further increases related to hiring or other from where we are today?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It depends on the topic. We've made a lot of progress on, I believe, our capital planning. I don't know enough to suggest that we're done, but we've made a lot of progress there. We have more hiring to do on the BSA\/AML, and as we talked to the folks, the plan is to continue to hire there. But I think we also are beginning our efforts on the other areas, you know what I mean? So my sense is that -- I don't have it in front of me. If I could give you -- Bob will probably put it in his annual report. But if I could give you a regulatory number, that number is probably going to go up, but I don't think our overall expenses will be going up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can we come back to the expenses that you're talking about that you've incurred in handling the regulatory issues? And they are going to remain elevated, of course, for a number of quarters. Can you give us an estimate of what you think down the road, what's kind of onetime, the outside consultants that you're using? And I know you've hired a bunch of people, and that's embedded, and that's going to remain around for quite some time. Is it 30% of the total numbers kind of the outside people and the rest is ongoing?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It's a tough question. Let me tell you why. Once I say it, it will sound obvious. But day one, when you decide to make your investment, it's heavily loaded with outside people. So and then at times, at the end, when you're at your steady state, there's none. So I mean, if you're at -- say, probably, we got a high percentage of people and you're seeing us replace, as those outside people go away, you're seeing us replace with core infrastructure. The CCAR we're probably be further along. So that's a tough one. And then actually, most of this management stuff is actually -- we hired Don Truslow. He's hiring permanent staff, so that's all permanent. If you want to look at it, if you want to look at what could be more variable, look at the professional service line, look at the ramp up of professional services. Don't just look over the last year. Look at it over 8 or 9 quarters, and you'll see in that professional services line what -- where you have expenses that could move.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then second, you've been able, as you've pointed out in this quarter, to do a little restructuring in the balance sheet, strengthens your capital ratios and with a very nice gain to boot. Last quarter, you had some securities gains. Do you still have those types of opportunities in the next 2 or 3 quarters to help defray some of those elevated costs that you're running into with the regulatory issues here?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, no. I think the way I look at those -- each of those transactions, maybe with the exception of the Visa, were net cost to me. So the indirect auto loans were lower returns, but they were above our cost of capital. And so that was just the least cost way to get the liquidity profile, but they're all net cost. So to the extent that I don't have to do any more of those, I'd be very, very happy. So -- and I think as we kind of look at our projection where we will be, as I said, the only thing we really have left on the balance sheet is maybe more liquid. And fortunately, we have a fair amount of cash to be able to do that today. So yes, I wouldn't expect to see a lot of those types of gains and sale-type activities.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Speaking of those auto loans, aside from the lower yields that you just mentioned, did credit come into your thinking as well in securitizing them about the potential for increased delinquencies or anything?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, related to high quality credit book, I mean, the long answer is we look at everything, but -- including the expenses. But no, I mean, that was very high quality. That's a book we originally underwrote at the time before we thought about the liquidity efforts we were going to keep those loans and so...","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","We'll wrap it up with a technical question and I have 2 kind of broader kind of scope questions. If you look at the technical side, the other cost in operations was up almost $50 million. You mentioned several things, but it didn't really all add up to the $50 million. I just didn't know if there was something else beside the topics you've been talking about that's kind of loaded into that other expense line.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Did you adjust for the Wilmington accrual issue?","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I thought that I had tried to do that, but maybe that's the difference so...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","So I mean, that will be a big number, and then there was just a lot of little individual things, nothing that will really -- no one big item that I can really tell you about.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So nothing else transitory that would come out of that number?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the 2 bigger kind of scope, as you kind of look back and think of all the increased expenses, investment and process that you've had to put in place, really 2 things and with this is, one, what do you think was the primary catalyst? Was it because of your size growing or you're just active in M&A? Or is it just rolling down to smaller and smaller banks getting to be required to be, like you said, at the best of the industry even though your operations were maybe much simpler. But what was the catalysts? And then two, do you think after all is done, do you see improvement in risk management where you've already been one of the best in the industry? But do you see any back end benefit from doing all these exercise that will make you manage the bank differently or better?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I mean, give me one second -- I mean, I'm just writing your question down -- the first part, I would go at it in 2 ways. I mean, as I said before, particularly on technology front and other areas like that, we were at a stage where we needed to make a fair bit of investment. So well, we hired Mahesh from one of our counterparts -- I don't know, it's almost 2 years ago now, right? And we've hired a number of other people because we realized that we needed to build the infrastructure from a larger bank. We had done 3, 4 or 5 acquisitions, right, recently. So that was what on our mind, the speed of it is clearly the fact that we are about $50 billion and growing. And the expectation is not only that you've got to be top notch in terms of risk management and controls because we've always been top-notch in terms of controls, but you can't do it right now. So if you take those 2 things combined, I think we're probably headed there anyway, but it's been accelerated a bit. The second part of your question, as to whether we can do anything better, the way I would characterize it is that M&T -- so we've had a great track record around control, and part of that is because we're so detail oriented. We focus a lot on people. We like to look under the covers of everything. When we close the books on a monthly basis, if moving expense went up, the question we ask is who moved. So we're very, very detailed. What we're trying to do as we get larger is to sort of overlay an addition sort of processes that let us see across the bank as the bank gets bigger, right? So I think it's probably a very positive thing. I think, does it justify all the cost we're spending? I don't know how you could possibly do that, but will there be some benefit? Yes, sure. Sure, there will be some benefit, especially when it comes to the risk management environment that Truslow is creating. I mean, I'm really looking forward to that. I mean, that's very, very necessary, given the larger size of the bank.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","It sounds like this is still like kind of a stepwise, one of those points where you're growing assets on a linear line, but all of a sudden, your resources have to kind of ratchet up, but then they'll level out and you will get the benefit of capacity going forward?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. And then the other thing you realize is that as you -- in that size, whatever size we are, as a regional bank, I mean, it's not like -- I mean, take BSA\/AML, it's not like we're going to have a state-of-the-art system that nobody else is going to have. I mean, this is probably the new requirement across the industry just to be in the game. So we figured we better get that done quickly. I hate to be behind in that respect.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just lastly, the other kind of broad scope was, earlier you mentioned the increase in your capital ratios with the delay [ph] you've seen in the acquisitions, do you think that, that changes your posturing as you go into the 2014 CCAR and how you think about deployment of capital?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No, we haven't had any change whatsoever in our thinking. I don't know. We think it's just prudent to -- at this stage of the game to have more capital, and we've talked about whether it's now or down the road, as other opportunities come up. We think it's just a prudent position to have today. So I've been really pleased that we've sort of gotten ourselves back to the pack, and have a much, much stronger capital level. But we don't see any reason to change the course that we're on now of adding capital.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And that's where you're kind of patient at looking at how to deploy it comes into play. You know that eventually you'll have that opportunity?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's exactly right. That's exactly right. So you're thinking about how to do that, and a lot of people early in the process assume that, well, M&T's going to have to have a lot more capital so the return's going to go down. Our job is to manage both sides of that equation, right, and we're trying to rationalize it. As we have more capital, certain things have made sense before don't make any sense anymore. And so far, we're doing a pretty good job at it. We're going to keep working on that trade-off.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue.

I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call both by telephone and through the webcast.","If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules, from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link. Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements related to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you, Don. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to discuss the first quarter results. Let me begin by reviewing the highlights, after which Don and I will take your questions.","Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.50 in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $1.04 earned in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net interest income for the recent quarter was $206 million, up from $148 million in the linked quarter. Other than our normal seasonal uptick in compensation expense, there was very little in the way of unusual items in our first quarter results. However, there were a number of items from prior periods that I'd like to remind you of which impact the comparison to the linked quarter and the year ago quarter.","Last year's fourth quarter included a write-down of our investment in Bayview Lending Group, settlement of a lawsuit and the contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation, which reduced earnings for the quarter by a net $33 million after tax or $0.26 per common share. Also, in last year's first quarter, we recorded $39 million of securities gains as a result of the repositioning of our securities portfolio in advance of last May's completion of the Wilmington Trust acquisition. Those gains amounted to $24 million after tax or $0.20 per common share. Excluding those gains, diluted earnings per share increased by 8% year-over-year.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude after-tax -- the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions. Included in GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were merger-related expenses related to the Wilmington Trust acquisition amounting to $2 million after tax or $0.01 per common share. This compares with $10 million after tax or $0.08 per common share in the prior quarter. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $10 million or $0.08 per common share in the recent quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter. ","M&T's net operating income for the quarter, which excludes those items, was $218 million, up from $168 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.59 for the recent quarter compared with $1.20 in the linked quarter. Net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.18% and 16.79% for the recent quarter, improved from 0.89% and 12.36% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including intangible assets and equity. Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and the income statement.","Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $627 million for the first quarter of 2012, up an annualized 2% from the linked quarter. Net interest margin expanded during the first quarter, averaging 3.69%, up 9 basis points from 3.60% in the fourth quarter. All of the increase can be attributable -- excuse me, all of the entries can be attributed to a sizable change in the mix of average earning assets. The net interest-bearing -- the interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, which had been in place for most of the third and fourth quarters, declined by $1.7 billion on a linked quarter basis and was largely offset by $1.4 billion of linked quarter increase in average loans. ","Aside from the benefit of replacing the cash at the Fed with loan growth, there was approximately 3 to 4 basis points of margin compression as a result of new loans coming on the books at lower yields than those maturing -- than those of maturing loans. This pressure was offset by lower funding costs and a one-basis-point benefit from one less day in the first quarter. In other words, we still believe that we are positioned for slight downward pressure on loan yields with some modest offset on the funding side. ","As for the balance sheet, average loan growth for the first quarter was strong, increasing by approximately $1.4 billion or an annualized 10% to $60.5 billion. On that same basis, compared with 2011's fourth quarter, changes in average loans category -- loans by category were as follows. Commercial & industrial loans grew by an annualized 9%. Commercial real estate loans grew by an annualized 8%. Residential real estate loans were up by $806 million or an annualized 43%, reflecting our continued policy of retaining the bulk of our nonconforming mortgage loan originations to hold on our balance sheet. Consumer loans declined an annualized 6%, driven by lower indirect auto loans and modestly lower home equity loans and lines of credit. ","On an end-of-period basis, loans grew an annualized 6% compared with the linked quarter. Average investment securities declined by an annualized 7%. Our appetite for purchasing securities was lessened in the first quarter based on the low yields available combined with our ongoing residential mortgage loan retention program. Average core customer deposits, which exclude foreign deposits and CDs over $250,000, were down an annualized 3%. The decline reflects the impact from trust deposits which had -- which we had temporarily held on our balance sheet during the fourth quarter in a fiduciary capacity before paying the funds to the ultimate beneficiaries.","We experienced core deposit growth in all of our community banking regions. On an annualized basis, average core deposits grew in our Upstate New York area by 11%, while our Metro area, which includes New York City, Philadelphia and Westchester, which we sometimes call Tarrytown, grew by 4%. Pennsylvania also grew by 4%, followed by the Mid-Atlantic with 2% growth. The outsized growth in Upstate New York was aided by our ability to acquire new customers as a result of the disruption coming from the -- from HSBC's exit of the upstate market. On an end-of-period basis, core deposits increased an annualized 11%, reflecting, in part, seasonal inflows of municipal deposits.","Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $377 million in the first quarter compared with $398 million in the prior quarter. Linked quarter results included $55 million from the settlement of the lawsuit that I previously noted. Other-than-temporary impairment charges related to our investment securities portfolio amounted to $11 million in the recent quarter compared with $25 million in the linked quarter. Excluding those charges from both periods as well as the legal settlement, noninterest income was $388 million for the recent quarter, up an annualized 22% in comparison to the -- with the $368 million in last year's fourth quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues rose to $56 million in the recent quarter compared with $41 million in the prior quarter. The increase is attributable to the combination of higher loan volumes, wider gain on sale margins and a lower repurchased cost. We estimate that our mortgage banking revenues could have been some $21 million higher had we elected to sell the mortgage loans we originated to hold on our balance sheet in the quarter. That comparable figure was $11 million in last year's fourth quarter. Fee income from deposit services provided, which include debit card interchange, were $109 million during the quarter compared with $104 million in the linked quarter.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $620 million for the first quarter. This compares to $706 million in the fourth quarter, which included the BLG write-down and the contribution to The M&T Charitable Foundation. Excluding those 2 items, operating expenses for last year's fourth quarter were $597 million. And this quarter's seasonal increase in salaries and benefits that I mentioned earlier amounted to approximately $26 million for the recent quarter and included the items which typically -- which we typically note, such as the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, higher FICO expense, higher unemployment insurance expense and expenses related to our 401(k) match. As in prior years, we would expect a decline in the second quarter as these items return to normal levels.","Including those $26 million of seasonal items, our operating expenses were still just $2 million higher than they were in the third quarter of 2011 which, as you'll recall, was the first full quarter following the merger but before any of the merger integration synergies had been realized. This should give you a good indication that we've made substantial progress in achieving the majority of our target expense savings even though we've yet to realize the benefits from the midyear conversion of our trust and investment systems. The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses as well as intangible amortization and merger-related expense -- gains and expenses, was 61.1% for the first quarter compared with 67.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Next, let's turn to credit. Overall credit trends continue to show improvement. Nonaccrual loans decreased to 1.75% of total loans at the end of the first quarter, down from 1.83% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter. Other nonperforming assets consisting of assets taken into -- in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $140 million as of March 31, down from $157 million as of the end of 2011. Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $48 million, down from $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Recall that in the fourth quarter, we charged off approximately $19 million on a single residential development project in Northern Virginia. There is still the potential for some lumpiness in charge-offs from time to time as loans that otherwise are specifically reserved for may ultimately result in charge-offs. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 32 basis points, down from 50 basis points in the linked quarter. ","Provision for Credit Losses was $49 million for the first quarter compared with $74 million in the linked quarter. The provision very slightly exceeded the net charge-offs, and as a result, the allowance for credit losses increased to $909 million as of the end of the first quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit -- for credit losses to total loans was 1.49% compared with 1.51% at the end of the linked quarter. The loan loss allowance as of March 31, 2012, was 4.7x net charge-offs for the quarter.","We disclose loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately on a nonaccrual -- on nonaccrual loans, because they are deemed to be well secured in the process and in the process of collection, which is to say there's very low risk of principal loss. Loans 90 days past due, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition, were $273 million at the end of the quarter. Of these loans, $253 million or 93% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Loans 90 days past due were $288 million at the end of 2011, of which 88% were guaranteed by government-related entities. ","M&T's estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio was 7.04% at the end of March, up from 6.86% at the end of December. This reflects higher capital from retained earnings, partially offset by the larger end-of-quarter balance sheet.","Lastly, as most of you know, we don't offer much in the way of earnings guidance, but we'll share our thoughts on our general outlook. Our balance sheet continues to be positioned for slight downward pressure on the net interest margin as a result of new loans and securities coming onto the balance sheet at lower yields than those maturing. This should be muted by a lower cost of deposits combined with lower cost on borrowings. ","As we noted in -- on the January earnings conference call, we expect the full year net interest margin for 2012 to be modestly lower than the 7.37% reported for the full year of 2011. And when combined with mid-single-digit loan growth, we anticipate continued growth in net interest income throughout 2012.","The possibility of large, temporary cost deposits coming onto the balance sheet for a period of days or weeks, as was the case in last year's fourth quarter, is more likely than in the past, driven by our large corporate client service business and its success in generating new business. I'd stress that while these deposits can dilute the state of net interest margin while they're on our balance sheet, there is no reduction of net interest income, and in fact, it's a very slight positive due to net interest income while we have them on our balance sheet.","We remain very focused on expenses, both on the day-to-day cost of operating the business as well as on achieving the remainder of our cost-saving opportunities arising from the Wilmington Trust integration. We continue to expect the remainder of those opportunities to be realized over the next 3 quarters with the majority of the impact occurring in the second half of the year following our planned second quarter trust systems conversion, and we continue to expect up to $10 million of merger-related cost in 2012. This figure includes the cost incurred in the recent quarter.","I believe our caution with respect to credit may have been misunderstood by some to mean that we are concerned about the potential for an uptick of problem loans in our own portfolio. I want to stress that, in fact, our caution comes in part from our conservative DNA combined with external factors, such as the continued historically high level of unemployment, the eurozone crisis, the U.S. fiscal deficit and the possibility of another fight over the current federal borrowing cap. Unfortunately, none of those issues are under our control, and that said, we continue to see steady improvement in the level of criticized and nonaccrual loans supporting our strong credit performance. Over time, we optimistically expect those trends will continue. Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. ","And now, we'll open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The deployment of liquidity was one of the big impacts on the balance sheet this quarter. You deployed about -- looks like $1.5 billion of those deposits into the Fed, moving them into the loan growth. So a lot of that's dictated by the mortgage banking and how much you've been able to see. With the increase in mortgage banking fee income as well as the opportunity probably to touch more mortgages and also the kind of increase in deposits that kind of rekindled the period and number back in the Fed balances, it looks like you got about another $1 billion left that you could redeploy going into this quarter. What's your thoughts about utilizing that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I mean, I think we -- obviously, we had a big end of fourth quarter loan growth, which carried over to this -- to the first quarter. But I think if I take it in parts, we definitely have -- we've not seen an abatement of growth in deposits, so that trend has continued longer than I guess I would have thought if I was sitting here a year ago. So that bodes pretty well. I noted in Upstate New York that we've got great deposit trends. There's a bit of disruption going on here from all the different conversions and so forth. So I think that's good. And then if you flip over to the other side, I think we had 5% end-of-period growth in C&I loans, right? So while not as robust as in the fourth quarter end of period, we're still seeing growth, and obviously, we've got a fair amount of residential mortgages that we've been putting on each quarter. So I think -- I would guess that we'll be able to utilize the core deposit growth that we see. Having said that, I think, as we mentioned, the -- our commercial client services business is such that we could get even larger swings of cash balances which, in some cases, I think might go unutilized as I kind of think out in the future, whether it be from our loan agency business or from assisting people with securitizations and those types of things, that the capital markets start to pick up.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","But with additional kind of origination production going on, do you feel like you want to use the extra $1 billion with the stronger positive growth that you're already seeing? It's like you reloaded as you went to the first quarter, and you got a chance to go out and deploy another slug of mortgages in there that could really help balance the balance sheet as well as be able to generate some offset to that compression that you were talking about in net interest margin.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, I think -- I guess I haven't thought about it that way. I continue to think and we continue to think that because we're light when you combine discretionary assets, which we would call mortgages and securities, we're just doing the tradeoff, right? So if you look on the other side, I don't have the amount, but we had a runoff on our securities book, right, as well, so that's kind of a substitute for the mortgage growth, and my sense is that trade-off will continue. I think that was down almost -- the investment securities were down almost $0.5 billion.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The last thing I was going to ask you, as the trustees increased a nice 3%, which is the first increase we've seen since the merger with Wilmington Trust, how much of that was market valuation lift versus -- when we were out there talking to management, you're all real excited about being able to see some of those customers, Wilmington Trust, come back on board and be able to see -- be able to cross-sell into that product as well. So how much is market related versus tactical or strategic traction that you're getting?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thanks, Marty. Good questions. Yes. So I mean, if you look -- and let me sort of tee that back up. I would say that as I kind of -- now look, we have 3 quarters. We went from the third to the fourth, and our trust fees, Wilmington combined with M&T, were flat. And when you look at a lot of trust businesses out in hindsight, a lot of people were down. So we were actually pretty pleased with our results in the fourth quarter. And then we saw a nice growth into the first quarter, which was driven primarily by 2 things: our capital markets and agency business as well as an uptick in the retirement services. Retirement services, obviously, is a result of the S&P 500 being up 12%. So there, we saw fees grow maybe 4%, 5%, right? Because we don't have 100% equities there. We're a little less sensitive to equities, but we still have improvement. And then as we look at the various capital markets business, if you think of our default administration business, as you know, we've got -- we've been able to get a number of sort of headline appointments there. We're the trustee on GM, Eastman Kodak, American Airlines. We added MF Global. And those things combined and the work associated with those things have actually allowed us to sort of hold our ground there and in fact, actually get a little bit of an increase. So what I'm always impressed about is that I thought we had a pretty aggressive outlook on what we might be able to do in the first quarter for trust, and we're able to do that. What I'm most impressed about is sort of as we learn about it, the diversity of the Wilmington Trust business is a nice thing. There's always sort of something going on. There's a win in one place when you don't see it in another. So that's the best answer I have for you, but I -- we were pretty pleased with trust.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","We had several questions on the composition of consumer real estate originations, which I'm guessing there's almost all conforming resi mortgages. But what is the average maturity, yield and duration on these originations?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I'll give you some sense if you give me about 2 seconds here. So we've got -- if you look at what we did in the quarter, so I'd say about half of what we did are agency-related securities. And of that, about half of those, 50% of those are 15-year. Another 10% to 12% are 20-year, and then the remainder, maybe 30%, 40% of it would be 30 years. And then we're more on the 30-year side with the FHA production that we did, which was a sizable portion also of the total amount that we did, maybe 40% of what we did. And then we've got some smaller products, which are more in the 15, but it sort of weighted themselves down towards the 15- to 20-year. So I would guess it's probably like half  15-year, half 30 at this point and with the idea that we're graduating more towards 15-year as we put things on to deal with the duration issue.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Ren\u00e9, specially related to 30-year duration or the 30-year maturity paper, what are your thoughts on duration extension risk to the balance sheet given what could happen when government stimulus and then rates eventually go up?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think that we're not concerned about it in the sense that if we were to keep putting mortgages on for a longer period of time, I guess we'd get to a point where we think we had too much duration risk. We're already relatively low, and again, we're light in that space, right? So think of it as when you think of the replacement of the securities book, which a lot of are MBS, right, and you look at the tradeoff, our duration is growing a bit, but it's still in the wheelhouse of where it's been in the past. So nothing concerning just yet.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Not even on the change on where that could go when rates go up? Because obviously, it would extend that.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, yes. I mean, we would be -- no, that's what we're considering when we're putting it on, right? So we're thinking about extension risk and all of those types of things as we model it out. Right now, we're still comfortable with the mortgages. Although I do say that we do have more of an appetite for 15 years as we progress, because with the refi boom, we're probably ahead of where we thought we would be.","Operator","Next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick things. So number one, just to ask the question, obviously, the CCAR came and went, and I think you guys made the comment that you had not put in for anything related to the eventual TARP payback and that you would just have to I guess resubmit that at that time. I was wondering if you could just kind of walk through then just how you have to think through that at whatever point it is in the future when you get to that point. Do you have to just -- do you have to wait till annual review? Or can you resubmit an interim if you had a thought process around becoming in a more immediate timeframe?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I think what we said was that to the extent that we wanted to repay the TARP, we would have to resubmit, and I guess this process is to resubmit. But at this point in time, I don't really have any more information on our thinking. We've stated it a lot in the past, but I do think -- if you don't mind, I would like to just sort of kind of walk back through the points again, because I think it kind of matters. We've heard a lot of stories out there about our TARP. So you'll recall that we were kind of reluctant to participate in the program. And so we -- as a result, we were one of the -- we were the only one and the largest bank to take just 1% of $600 million. And the thought process back then was that we didn't want it. We didn't think we need it, but at the height of the crisis, there was a lot of pressure on banks to prove that they were strong enough to receive it. So what we essentially did is we took the minimum to show that we were strong enough to qualify but not -- but also strong enough not really to need it. And so then, as you kind of move along, we ended up with acquiring some troubled franchises, Provident and Wilmington, and we took on more than $180 million more. We paid back $700 million. So now we've paid back more than we originally took. And so I think -- and our plan is to just keep dialoguing with the treasury and others and -- over time, and we'll pay back the remaining balance when we find that that's practical or appropriate, and we're committed to paying it in full. I think the other thing is, is that if you kind of look at the second piece of that, if you look at where the warrants are trading since -- whether they be ours or those other institutions, there's a very sizable gain that's embedded in the warrant. So our picture, we'll get rid of it as soon as we can. I don't have any more information for you today, but our -- but that's our goal. And as we work with the treasury, we'll hopefully get to a point where we can give the money back.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And the other 2 piece of this is that -- is are you at the point at least where -- now where you can help us give a -- get a better understanding of what your Basel III would look like if you had to present it today?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We talked about that. I'm not -- I think we're just going to wait. Most of the banks that have done it, as you know, are speculating based on what the Basel III original rules are coming out of Europe. And our opinion is we'll just wait and see what happens when the final rules come out, and we'll publish something then.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My second question, Ren\u00e9, is just, obviously, the mortgage strength across the board was very clear this quarter, both in terms of the amount you were able to put on the books and then your comments. Just seeing the mortgage banking fee strength and plus the fact you could have gotten if you had sold, I was wondering if you can kind of give us some -- a little bit deeper color in terms of just what was origination versus what was gain on sale on the fee side. And can you walk us also again through the -- your time lag in terms of apps that haven't closed or you gotten paid on yet?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I can try to do it in a simpler fashion. Maybe I'll just give you a couple of numbers, if you give me a minute. I mean, when you look at our -- so I'll start with application volume. We had total application volume of $2.4 billion, which was up 31% from the linked quarter, right? So huge, huge volume increase in total. And then if you kind of look at the components of that, most of it was from refi activity. About 12% of that volume was from the HARP program, right? So as you get back a couple of quarters, that didn't exist. So that kind of explains almost 1\/3 of the increase is the way I would think about that, and I would guess that that'll continue for some time. On those -- we're selling all those, but we are keeping the servicing on some portion of those loans. And then as you look, I think we locked about $900 million for future sale to our treasury division. And in the fourth quarter, that might have been about $800 million, and you actually saw the $800 million flow into the balance sheet this quarter, right? So you should see some strong effect. It depends on where rates are with the regular -- the total volume coming next quarter, but in any case, we seem to -- we'll have some nice carryover into the second quarter on our balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I'll start, last quarter, you pointed to more cost saves than the original $80 million. I think you said $90 million to $100 million. Just wondering where do you think that's looking now. And what was actually in the run rate as of the first quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","If I were to guess where we are, we're probably getting pretty close already to about the -- to the 15% number. We're knocking on that door of cost saves and which suggests that we're sort of on track to be a little bit over, because again, we haven't completed our trust and investment systems conversions, right? So I think that's what we're saying. We kind of feel like a lot of the uncertainty there or the work is done, but obviously, as we go further, I think we're going to probably outperform that original number will be my guess.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And, Ren\u00e9, once the cost saves are realized, how should we think about the growth of core expenses with Wilmington in the mix? Maybe historically, around 4% per year. Is that higher now with Wilmington?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It's interesting. When you look at the expenses, if you just take a detailed look at the expenses, it's pretty amazing. You can't discount -- and maybe even suggest go back and read again Bob Wilmers' message. The amount of expense that's been added because of the regulatory side, and not just the obvious ones but sort of all the added staff that you need for credit and compliance and those things, is pretty high. And I think I was looking at -- I don't have it exactly in front of me, but I think it's on the runs. We were probably -- FDIC insurance was probably up 52%, 53% from a year ago quarter. So all that said, to the extent that a lot of that is not going to continue at that pace, I think now, we're sort of settling in, trying to think in the new environment how do we operate things. And so our focus is going to be on sort of containing that growth as much as we can. Where you might see some growth would be on investment in things like technology, because as you look at your distribution network, which is -- which needs to be rationalized not just for us but everybody, you can only do that when you have pretty good technology that sort of offsets it in some consistency there. So -- but I think expenses will be pretty well managed. I think about the spread. I definitely think that we'll have an abnormal spread between the revenue growth and expense growth relative to the past couple of years.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And on the margin, just to follow it up -- follow up on your comments for slight pressure, would you consider restructuring some of the long-term debt, the way at least one other bank has, to take pressure off the margin?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No, because it's not economic, really. So I mean, this restructuring that we did against Wilmington Trust, I -- at least, it's the only one that I ever remember in the 20 years I've been here, and I would guess you could probably go back 30 and say the same. So I doubt it, because there's no economics in that whatsoever. We still have some -- which is one of the things you see in the margin, which is kind of subtle, but we still have some wholesale funding or longer-term wholesale funding from Provident and those transactions that will run off over the course of this year that will give us a little bit of relief.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And maybe just to follow up on Ken's question on TARP. I know you were very clear with your answer. Just curious, could we see an update on this this year? Or is it most likely with next year's stress test and capital plan that we'd next see an update on that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I can't tell you. When I know, I'll tell you.","Operator","Next question comes from Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Conor Fitzgerald ","This is Conor Fitzgerald for Erika. Just correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I heard you mention that auto loans were down. Was that a deliberate decision on your part, to pullback? Or did the overall pie shrink this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Auto loans were down. It's not any different than it's been trending. I think we said the total consumer loans were down about 4%. Auto loans were down I think about 3% unannualized, I would guess. Yes. So that portfolio has been running off, because quite frankly, as we said, we try to maintain a return at least at our cost of capital of 12% -- maybe 12%, 14% is where we've been running, and we've seen a lot of competitive pressure there. I recount one of our folks was out recounting a story where he went out and looked at some of the transactions going on. In one case, you had a 2009 sports car. The purchase price was $100,000. The loan-to-value was $98,000, and the credit score was 702. The yield for the customer was 1.34%. So with that kind of activity, we can't get anywhere near that. It doesn't make much sense to us. But in fact, it seems like it's a pretty good environment for the consumer, right, because money very, very cheap. So in our mind, we'll continue to generate $80 million to $100 million of that paper a month unless something changes in the competitive front, and that means that we're going to see slight downward trends in our balances there.","Conor Fitzgerald ","Got it. And then just on credit quality, how are you guys thinking about kind of normalized charge-offs as we move through the cycle and your reserve level?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","A couple of -- I mean, I -- and this is a guess. I mean, if I think back over a long period of time, I would guess we've built a company that the average charge-off rate over long periods is probably 30 to 40 basis points, right? And that swings low, and we still have high nonperformers, so I would expect that as that tapers off, you'll -- over long periods, you could get some good credit performance. The other thing I would direct you to is that if you look, again, over long periods of time, our movement in charge-offs mirrors the industry. So while we've always been much lower on a relative basis, the sort of tracking of it is almost in lockstep, because we're in the same asset classes everybody. It's just that we try to get more security on loans. So I don't know if that helps you at all.","Operator","Next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just to be clear -- hopefully, you have this number. The $21 million that you guys cited, if you had sold the resi mortgages, you would had $21 million of additional banking income. Presumably, that also means that you wouldn't have had the growth in resi that you did, which obviously provides -- or it grows your earnings assets, grows net interest income. Do you happen to have like a net number? Because it seems wrong to kind of just add in the $21 million, because you're already getting income from the loans that you kept.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, yes. Yes. We probably should have done a better job of that. So think about it this way, Ken, is -- so when you -- the way the accounting works is when you're selling it, originating the loan for sale, at the time of the lock, you record the gain. So the loan hasn't been closed yet. So all the gain on sale revenue you see in the first quarter was from loans we locked but have not yet closed. The $21 million is related to those $900 million of loans we talked about, right, which have not yet closed. So they're not in our numbers at all. They'll -- they won't be in our balance sheet till about 45 days after the lock period, so that means on average in the second quarter. Is that clear?","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes -- no, that does help. That's great.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","And the other thing we did is -- that's we gave you the $11 million last quarter. So if you kind of use last quarter's, that's what boosted the -- that's what -- it was those loans that boosted the first quarter balance sheet.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just another quick question. In terms of how -- what percentage, I guess, of your portfolio are you comfortable with resi mortgage being? How large can that grow?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We're way below the industry average. I don't know, a couple of points as a percentage of assets. We're not looking to do anything dramatic. I would guess when we're done, we'll be below the industry average.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, but you're comfortable going up close to the industry average. Okay.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Let me say that again.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess for you guys. That's what I was asking, you're tolerance for resi.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. No, no, no. Let me say that again. Again, it's an offset for security, so it depends on where we are with our investment securities portfolio. So right now, we're really low. I forget the numbers, but we're probably half of what the industry average is for investment securities. So you kind of have to look at both of them together.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Adam Chaim - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Adam Chaim calling for Matt O'Connor. I just have 2 quick questions for you. Sorry if you've discussed this already, but was there any impact from MPAs [ph] -- on MPAs and reserves from the new regulatory guidance on second lien home equity? I think 2\/3 of your home equity was second lien at year end. And the second is regarding salaries and benefits expense. Even excluding the seasonal increase, the $26 million you noted in your prepared remarks, we -- it still came in a bit higher than we expected. How much of that expense is generally driven by mortgage compensation?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think -- well, let me go in reverse order. I think very little of it is really driven by mortgage compensation. If you think about it, because when you book the loans, you have to defer a portion of the expenses, it actually -- it works the other way. It dampens the salaries a little bit when you have high mortgage volume, because you're deferring. But having said that, the -- our business is growing as well. So for example, the size of our servicing portfolio is a little larger as well and a few things like that. We've added people in the servicing area, so that's kind of what you're seeing there. And I think the other thing that we'll continue to do from time to time is, particularly with the Wilmington business, we'll start adding teams of people where we think the revenue growth actually can help us out. So I would say that probably the biggest thing that you're seeing there that you can't quite see is probably a larger servicing portfolio and some more staffing there. And then if I go back to your other question on the second liens, we did some work. And basically, what we think is that classifying our second lien loans as nonaccrual when the first loan is not paying would really have very little impact on our financial results. So what we do is -- and we disclose some of this in our 10-K, actually, you'll -- in our most recently published 10-K. We've got about 35% of our home equity portfolio that's actually a first lien, that are actually first lien loans, and then there's another 55% where we're behind -- which are behind first lien loans that are not owned by us or serviced by us. And what's really true about those loans is that we can't precisely sort of determine where -- whether there's a delinquency on the first loan. So what we do is we have a process in determining our overall adequacy of the allowance, but we start by looking a bit at our history. And then we test that history and adjust it if it's appropriate by looking at several factors, including some of our near-term forecast. In that, what we're looking at, sort of by geographical region, we're looking at changes in our collateral values. And we sort of -- as we do that, because we don't know what's happened to the first mortgage because we're not servicing it, essentially, what we do when we do those scenarios is we assume the original balance. We assume that the first loan is not paid down at all and that the original balance is still outstanding, and then we use that to sort of run our estimate. As we kind of run through the whole process, we feel pretty comfortable that we've kind of appropriately quantified the loss content in our portfolio, our home equity portfolio. And as you know, that portfolio has sort of a really nice performance over time. I think we were somewhere between 58 and 69 basis points of loss over the last 3 years, so I think we're in pretty good shape there.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about that trust deposit seasonality? Can you help size it up in terms of how much you expect it could be that it could impact the deposit balance?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I wish I could. It doesn't really work that way. So for example, recently, we were -- in early in the -- early in this second quarter, we were engaged to be trustee in a large securitization, right? So depending on the size of that securitization, we'll get a way above average -- we'll be holding that cash for that client for a short period of time, but it could be a significant amount of money. Sometimes it gets cut in half. So I mean, it can swing by several billions of dollars depending on the type of transaction that we're engaged in and how many we're engaged in.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then separately, can you give us a little bit more color on loan pricing through the quarter, particularly on the commercial side? And I know you gave some color around the resi book but just curious, in general, what you're seeing there. But more importantly, just competitive loan pricing, you also mentioned in direct auto. So clearly, we're seeing it there, but I'm curious what you're seeing elsewhere.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I mean, let me put it as a backdrop to that, in a number of places, we're seeing very positive things from our customers, whether that be because there's an uptick in the economy or activity or in some cases, just because the competition is down because a lot of their competitors have been sort of weeded out. But as you look at that as a backdrop, we have seen -- I'm going to use better language than one of our regional presidents. He -- I'll change his words. He told me that from a competitive standpoint, facility is back. And what he's talking about is that many of the community banks are pretty aggressive both on price and structure, and I'd say even relative to a year ago. And then when you get to some of the larger institutions, to the extent that they're healthy, because they're carrying -- we believe because they're carrying a fair amount of equity, they've been willing to do things that were probably a little lower than we would have expected. I think it makes sense from the context if you think -- if they think they're sitting there with excess equity, then that's kind of what you get. So it's pretty competitive. But having said that, as we kind of look into like Pennsylvania, for example, our business bankers and our branch managers seem to feel that there's good loan demand there and then not necessarily complaining about prices. And then, again, I would articulate that in Western New York, in Upstate New York, we've been, in terms of customer count on the business banking and loan side as well, we've seen good growth there at fairly reasonable margins. So that's what we know.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, can you give us just some color on the fluctuations again in the other revenue line item and as well as in the other expense item? Just give us some color on the moves.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's really one topic. I mean, so think about the idea that we had a big, big loan growth really in the fourth quarter leading into the first. What we actually had was probably an outsized amount of commercial loan fees, whether that be regular loan fees or syndication fees, what have you. And then as you went to the first quarter, we probably had an abnormal low amount, right, coming. So I think what will happen is that will sort of get back to a normal pattern. It's hard to really predict syndication-type fees and other credit fees on a quarter-to-quarter basis, so it jumps around a little bit. So I would say fourth was extreme. First is extreme the other way.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that was same thing on the expenses?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That was on the other revenue. So on the other expenses, oh, yes, yes. You got to normalize for a couple of things, right? So you've got to -- you first got to take  out the day that you right down on the charitable foundation. And once you do that, we were better by about, I don't know, $10 million, $11 million. And really, when you look into what's driving the better performances, it's a lot of seasonality. So you get professional services and those types of things that were higher at the end of the year, and some of that will come back. The first quarter is usually seasonally low than most of the other expenses, right? And then it kind of picks up a little bit going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Thomas Frick - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Tom Frick for Bob Ramsey. Just one quick question. As expected, your tax rate kind of ticked up looks like 6 points this quarter. Is 33% a good run rate for you going forward? Or how should we think about that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I'm a random walk guy, so my answer is yes, I think so. It was low last quarter because of -- because the income was low, and we had -- typically, you get this fixed tax credit. So I think we're probably at a pretty good place right now.","Operator","Next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just as we think about the loan growth, you had indicated perhaps single-digit loan growth. A lot of that's obviously being driven by the resi initiative at this point. As that starts to slow and that sort of strategy maybe plays itself out a bit, how do you think about the allocation of capital from there? And how does it change? And is -- maybe tie that into where -- what aspects of your business right now are you kind of most encouraged by?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, okay. So take the resis out for a minute, we had, obviously, a nice quarter of loan growth, C&I and real estate this quarter. And then on an end-of-period basis, C&I was about 5%. CRE was about 1%. So things continue to grow, right? And over time, I would guess if the economy gets better and you can't continue to see all this liquidity coming into the system, then you're going to see growth. So I'm not too worried about that. The one sort of benefit I think is that there's so much uncertainty still around capital levels. Everybody's sort of guessing at where we're going to be in the future. And so the idea that we are sort of deferring the gains kind of works in our favor, because one, we're growing capital. Capital is growing, but if we were to accelerate that by selling all the loans, then we're not quite sure what our use for that capital would necessarily be, particularly as we get up past the range that we're comfortable on the sort of Tier 1 common ratio. So I mean, I think right now, it's sort of just a wait and see. But I mean, in terms of what we're pleased with, I think we're watching cautiously our pricing but yet, our loan growth and everything I look at quarter-over-quarter -- I mean, quarter-after-quarter is probably a better term, slightly outpaces the industry. I feel that we've been taking share in a lot of places, and that's continued. So we feel good about that. And again, I guess I would have to reiterate that this is a very, very nice quarter from the wealth and trust business. I think we're very pleased with that. So I think we got a lot of positives. The bank is very healthy. In fact, I think the thing that struck me is -- I think it's on Page 14 of our press release, where we do the 5-quarter trend, and you kind of look at the fees. The fees were up across the board with the exception of that other that I mentioned and sort of tied to syndication fees. So I don't know. We feel pretty good about the way the underlying business is performing. We got to figure out how to do it a little bit more efficiency -- efficiently when the -- when all this sort of noise from the new environment settles down, and we can get our arms around it, but that's our task.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, how does M&A factor into your strategy over the next 6 to 12 months given what's going on in the environment?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, you don't buy banks. They get sold. So hopefully, someone will call us up from time to time, and if they did, we'd probably be ready. But I think the one practical thing we're doing is -- why we're not really concerned, I mean, if you think about our dividend policy -- so before, obviously, 2007, if you looked at our dividends, our dividend payout ratio was probably between 25%, 27%. We used to keep it very, very low, and then we used share buyback. Now our total payout ratio is somewhere around 40%, and it's actually -- when you think of it in total terms, it's low. So we're accumulating capital. Even beyond sort of the idea of accumulating it for the new regs, the new Tier 1 common rules, there's not really a ton of cost to doing that today, because we think bank stocks are very, very low. I think we did a slide on that. We went back to 2000, and you can see that the pricing is still relatively low on bank stocks. And we think that with the regulatory environment, we'd be surprised that there's not more consolidation. So our strategy is really simple: just keep working on your own bank, and eventually, something will come up that makes sense for both parties and be ready to do it.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to kind of refine your commentary around kind of deposit trends. So it sounds like there's some positive lumpiness coming in the trust business, and we had some at the end of the first quarter. But also, the second quarter sometimes can be a more difficult seasonal quarter for deposit growth. So what is your expectations in terms of total deposit growth? And also, how do you feel about the loan-to-deposit ratio now that it's 100% versus your longer term kind of objective?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","What we talk about here is, first of all, we have modest growth planned in our deposits for the year, particularly because we're more concerned about what happens when the rate environment turns around. And we've got a really significantly high levels of demand deposits relative to history. So we're kind of cautious on the idea that if things turned around and you do see loan growth, you're probably going to see a runoff in some commercial level deposits as those customers can go out and get better rates or return elsewhere, and they start actually using the cash. So I don't -- I can't tell you what it's going to be. I can just tell you that we're very cautious about it, so we tend not to assume large amounts of growth in the deposit portfolio. We worked really hard to get it, but...","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just one follow-up. Most equity markets are up around kind of 10%, 11% in the first quarter, and your trust income was only up 3%. And that's also in the back of a strong kind of fourth quarter. I know it's a smaller mix of equities, but is that normal to see your trust income up around 3% when equity markets are up something significantly higher, like 10%?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I think it is normal, because even when you look at the assets that we have, and I'll give you the number in a minute, but a -- there's a smaller portion of it is the equity market. And then a lot of the business, particularly in the corporate client service business, is not really tied to the market. It's tied to -- actually, it's not tied to the equity market. It's more tied to the overall capital markets and who is issuing debt and what kind of transactions are going on, right? So if you look at our total assets under management, I think about 36% are equities. And so that kind of makes sense, 12% up, 3%, 4% up in our retirement services and those asset-intensive businesses.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the M&T Bank's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules, from our website at www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Rene F. Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.","As we noted in the press release, M&T's results for the fourth quarter included an elevated level of professional services expense, reflecting our continued focus on building out our regulatory, risk management and technology infrastructure, including our BSA\/AML compliance program. This represents our second quarter in a row where our costs are above what we would consider the natural level required to operate the bank, even in what was we might refer to as the new banking environment.","More positive elements in the recent quarter's results included higher fee revenue and continued improvement in our credit, capital and liquidity measures. I'll review a few highlights from both the quarter and the past year, after which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions.","Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.74 during the period, compared with $2.11 in last year's third quarter and $2.16 in 2012's fourth quarter. Net income for the recent quarter was $246 million, compared with $294 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $296 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Recall that M&T's results for the third quarter of 2013 included gains in connection with our securitization of FHA loans to Ginnie Mae securities, which we retained in our investment portfolio, and our securitization of indirect auto loans, which were not retained. These transactions contributed $34 million to net income for that quarter, or $0.26 per common share.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. After tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets were $6 million, or $0.05 per common share, in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2013.","M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $252 million, compared with $301 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.79 for the recent quarter compared with $2.16 in the linked quarter.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.22% and 14.12% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.48% and 17.64% in the third quarter of 2013.","In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $673 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, down by $7 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.56% during the quarter, down 5 basis points, compared with 3.61% in the third quarter.","While average earnings assets increased by some 2% annualized, as compared with the prior quarter, the mix of those assets changed primarily as a result of the securitization transactions we undertook in the third quarter. The results included a $1.4 billion increase in average investment securities, offset by $1.3 billion of decrease in average loans. We estimate that this shift in the mix of earnings assets accounts for about 3 basis points of the linked quarter decline in the margin.","The core margin pressure, which is primarily the result of new loans coming on at rates lower than those maturing, and which is partially offset by lower cost of funds, amounted to about 2 basis points and was in line with our prior outlook.","On an end-of-period basis, investment securities were about $500 million higher at December 31, as compared with the end of the prior quarter, which reflects further use of the proceeds from the third quarter's auto loan securitization to purchase additional liquid investment securities.","Average total loans declined by 8% annualized from third quarter, also reflecting the impact of the securitizations, as well as a reduction in our portfolio of held-for-sale residential mortgages, mortgage loans which reflect the reduced level of mortgage refinancing activity that we're seeing.","Average commercial and industrial loans, which were not impacted by the securitizations, grew by a healthy 7% annualized. That growth came from the typical seasonal recovery in Floor Plan loans, as well as a fairly strong growth in the mid-Atlantic where C&I loans increased at a 14% annualized rate, and in Metropolitan New York -- and in the Metropolitan New York City area, which increased by 13%. C&I loans declined slightly in Upstate and Western New York and in Pennsylvania.","Average commercial real estate loans grew at an annualized pace of 2%. CRE lending was strongest in Tarrytown, Philadelphia and New Jersey, while CRE lending in New York City has become more competitive, and the portfolio declined slightly.","Adjusting for the auto loans securitization, average consumer loans grew at an annualized 3%; while on an end of period basis, they grew at an annualized 5%. All of that improvement was in the indirect auto portfolio, while other consumer categories remained sluggish. Overall, I would say that while the marketplace remains very competitive, we were able to maintain discipline in the fourth quarter and originated loans at acceptable margins.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, grew at an annualized pace of 8% from the third quarter. We continue to maintain a high level of excess funds at the Fed, averaging $2.8 billion for the quarter, reflecting a high level of deposits by institutional trust customers.","Turning to net interest -- turning to noninterest income, noninterest income totaled $446 million in the quarter compared to $477 million in the prior quarter. Of course, the third quarter figure included the securitization gains I referred to earlier, which totaled $56 million before taxes.","Mortgage banking revenues increased to $82 million in the recent quarter, up $17 million from $65 million in the prior quarter. This includes 3 components: Residential gain on sale revenues were $15 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of $3 million from the third quarter; residential origination volumes declined by about 25% from the third quarter to approximately $800 million; while residential gain on sale margins actually expanded about 10 basis points.","Residential mortgage servicing revenues grew by $13 million to $46 million in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects the impact from a full quarter of revenue from the sub-servicing contract that we entered into during the third quarter.","On the commercial side of mortgage banking, gain on sale revenues grew by $6 million, returning to more normalized levels after a weak third quarter. Fee income from deposit service charges were $110 million during the fourth quarter, compared with $114 million on a linked quarter, primarily due to lower levels of consumer activity.","Trust and investment revenues were $126 million, up $2 million from $124 million in the prior quarter and up $9 million or 8% from a year-ago quarter.","Turning to expenses. As we've noted for some time now, we continue to make investments in our risk management and compliance framework in the areas discussed earlier. We also continue to invest in our technology infrastructure, including the new data center here in Buffalo, an enterprise data warehouse project, which will allow us to centralize and improve access to customer information for both regulatory reporting and our own internal use. And the new Web Banking platform, which goes live this weekend. As a result, our operating expenses have risen meaningfully from what we think -- what we would think of as our normal ongoing expense levels.","Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which excluded expenses from amortization of intangible assets, were $693 million, up $45 million from the $648 million in the prior quarter, and up $81 million from the $612 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The primary driver of the linked-quarter increase was professional services, which increased by $42 million compared with the third quarter, and by $50 million from the year-ago quarter -- $51 million from the year-ago quarter.","In the fourth quarter, about $25 million, or nearly 60% of the increase in those expenses, was related to regulatory activities and projects for items such as the customer multifactor risk-rating model that was developed for our BSA\/AML initiative, as well as further development and validation of models used in connection with the CCAR stress-testing framework. An additional $7 million of the linked-quarter increase was related to the technology infrastructure project that I mentioned.","In total, an excess of 50% of the $81 million increase in expenses from the fourth quarter of 2012 could be attributable to the ramp-up of our spending on BSA\/AML and in preparation for CCAR 2014.","Looking ahead, operating expenses, particularly for professional services tied to our BSA\/AML initiative, will remain elevated through March of 2014, although likely at a running rate below what we saw in the fourth quarter.","While it is difficult to predict the quarterly spending patterns for all professional services as we meet our expected milestones over the course of 2014, our quarterly rate of professional services spending should ramp down further as we progress into the latter part of the year.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses as well as the intangible amortization and then merger-related expenses, was 61.9% for the fourth quarter compared with 56.0% in the prior quarter. And the efficiency ratio for the full year of 2013 was 56.2%, unchanged from 2012.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remained strong and in line with our expectations. Nonaccrual loans declined by $45 million from the end of the third quarter. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined by 8 basis points to 1.36% as of the end of the fourth quarter. And when we file our 10-K in a month or so, I expect we'll report another meaningful decline in classified loans as well.","Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $42 million compared with $48 million in the third quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 26 basis points for the fourth quarter, improved slightly from 29 basis points in the third quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $42 million in the fourth quarter. The allowance for credit losses was $917 million, amounting to 1.43% of loans at the end of the year. The loan-loss allowance as of December 31, 2013, was 5.5x annualized net charge-offs.","Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at acquisition, were $396 million at the end of the quarter. Of these loans, $298 million or 81% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Accruing loans 90 days past due was $340 million at the end of the third quarter, of which 94% were guaranteed by government agencies.","Turning to capital. M&T's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 9.25% at the end of December, up 17 basis points from 9.08% at the end of the third quarter. Our estimated tier -- our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio, under the recently adopted Basel III capital rules, is approximately 9.01%. M&T's Tier 1 common ratio has increased by some 168 basis points since the end of 2012, while our tangible common equity has grown $1.2 billion, or a 20% increase. Over the same period, tangible book value per share grew by 18% to 52.64% -- I'm sorry, $52.64.","Before we turn to the outlook, let me take a minute to cover the full year results for 2013. Diluted earnings per common share were $8.38, an increase of 11%. Net income was $1.2 billion, which represents a 13% year-over-year increase. GAAP-basis net income, expressed as the rate of return on average assets and average common equity, was 1.39% and 11.18%, respectively, improved from 1.29% and 10.96% in 2012.","Net operating income, which excluded the amortization and merger-related expenses, was again $1.2 billion, an increase of 12% from the prior year. Diluted net operating income per share was $8.60 per share, an increase of 10% from 2012, and the rate of return on tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity for 2013 was 1.5% and 18.17%, respectively.","Let me turn to the outlook. Based on our perceptions on where the economy and interest rates are headed, our outlook has not changed meaningfully from the one that we offered you at this time last year.","On a core basis, before the steps we've needed to take -- that we need to take to come into compliance with the LCR rules, we're thinking that loan growth next year will be in the low- to mid-single-digit range, maybe closer to mid-single digit if you adjust for the securitizations. On that same basis, and based on where the forward curve is, we're expecting somewhat less NIM compression than in 2013. At present, we'd estimate about 2 basis points per quarter.","These factors should combine to produce some modest growth in net interest income. However, beyond our base case outlook, we need to factor in the impact from the additional actions that we will take to reach full compliance for the liquidity coverage ratio by the end of the year, and we have made good progress on the LCR compliance, but we have further actions to take.","For example, we need to continue to build our liquid asset buffer of MBS and treasury securities and issue unsecured bank notes to fund that buffer. We expect there will be limited, if any, negative impact on net interest income, but the reported net interest margin will likely be diluted. And we'll keep you updated as we take these actions over the course of 2014.","We're expecting mid-single-digit fee revenue growth in 2014, including the benefit from a full year of revenue from the sub-servicing contract. And as noted earlier, expenses will be elevated well into the second half of 2014, but at a rate below what we saw in the fourth quarter. And our goal is to be well positioned on expenses as we enter 2015.","Consistent with the past, we will see our usual seasonal rise in salaries and benefits in the first quarter, which was about $37 million in 2013.","The outlook for credit is stable. There are no signs of turn in asset quality. With regard to Hudson City, our December announcement represents our expectation that we'll be able to meet our milestones for BSA\/AML project -- for the project over the course of the year and give regulators time to assess the progress that we've made before the end of the year. We are very focused on implementing a high-quality BSA\/AML compliance program, one that will set this industry standard and position us for the future.","Over the course -- of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national, regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Lastly, on a personal note, we would like to acknowledge the resignation of our friend and mentor, Mike Pinto. As you know, Michael has scaled back to a limited but important role focusing on several key initiatives. Many of you have dealt with Michael also know that it will be impossible to replace somebody with his knowledge of the industry and of M&T.","Over the past 20 years that I've worked with Michael and over the nearly 30 years that he's worked with all of us at M&T, he's helped us to understand what's important in running a bank. As a result, he leaves a cohort of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s that have absorbed that knowledge thoroughly and who, I'm confident, will represent him well.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Jackie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, just on the expense side. Understanding your point that it's tough to predict what consulting is going to look like. But if we take your comment that the delta has been about, I guess, $40 million of excess consulting, just -- would you expect that we would be ending next year expenses kind of more towards this quarter minus that benefit? Like do you think you'll get through all of the excess consulting by the end of next year?","Rene F. Jones","Well, it's a good question, Ken, thanks. So the first thing I would point out is that the $42 million, as you mentioned, was this quarter. We saw a very similar increase last quarter. So we are very helpless -- we're well above our normal run rate on professional services expense. I think, as we look at the expense base in the fourth quarter, in some ways it appears to be a high, and we would expect that as we kind of move into the next year, that they'll remain elevated and then taper off, kind of what you're saying. But the question is, how fast will it come down. So I think we should see meaningfully lower expenses by the time we get to the fourth quarter, but I also think that expenses will likely be able to come down further from there, all right? The one thing I would point out is that, as we begin to think about the work we have to do over the course of, let's say, the next 3 quarters on BSA\/AML and some of the initiatives that we have, to the extent that we think we need to go faster, we'll just ramp that up and that would sort of mean that expenses would be higher than we thought. But I don't think the total investment is really going to change at all. So that's why I'd say it's a bit hard to predict because we're sort of making sure that we stay on track with our progress. And if that means the timing of the expenses changes, so be it.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's fair. And just one other question about the fee guidance. When you're talking about mid-single digit, I'm wondering just against what base you're comparing it to. And then also a little color on what you think will drive stronger fee growth next year.","Rene F. Jones","I think -- I'll go backwards. I think it will go across the board. We've seen nice growth, 5%, 5-plus percent each of the last 2 years in the trust business. We've seen okay growth in deposit service charges. And then, again, as we look at what we're doing with the mortgage servicing, you should get some lift from that coming late in half of the year. So there's no one particular category. One of the things I'm curious about is that commercial banking fees were somewhat light this year, and I think that's a reflection of lower activity, but as the economy picks up, that would be another space that I would expect to see maybe recover a bit from what we saw this year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last quick one. Can you just give us an update of where the Basel III ratio approximated?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. It's -- this quarter, fully-phased, and we believe it is 9.01%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So, again, I guess another question on the expense side. I guess, thinking about the BSA\/AML investment and the milestones you talked about, you know that you guys have set for this year, obviously, to hit those, and then get ready for that resolution and then onto the Hudson City merger. I guess, when you're think about the total investment, can you give us an idea of maybe expected percentage of completion, if you will, by the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter next year that you would be 50% through, or 75% through? Is there any other way to think about how we should be thinking about, maybe how quickly that investment may taper off as we go through next year?","Rene F. Jones","Well, I don't know if I can give a better answer than I just gave on the pace of the expenses. But I think the way to think about it, Brian, is that you can't give a measure of completions because it's a dynamic process. So we work with our teams to build out a process. We go through that, we have those processes validated by outside parties. To the extent that there's more to work to be done, we go in and we fix that and it's iterative, it's an iterative process. We draw leads at some point in the process where we feel that we'll be ready and confident that we can have the regulators come in and take a look and have the time to do what they need to do. So in my mind, it doesn't work like that in terms of percentage of completion. But having said that, we think that our expenses will probably remain elevated for the next 2 or 3 quarters. And I wouldn't see -- I would see after that, that much of the sort of outside expense should be behind it. The thing to think about is, we've also added a lot of folks, I didn't give the numbers here, but we've added a lot of folks over the course of the year. And the reason that we've done that is to sort of build our permanent infrastructure. So as we sort of get through the project phase, we will not be dependent upon all of those professional services. So as you look at where that was, I think we spent maybe $134 million on professional services in this quarter, and I don't have the number for last quarter, but maybe it was $80 million or something. All right, so you can get a sense, if you look back at those numbers over time, how much they've ramped up and what likely a normal run rate would be without them with all other projects.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, thinking -- you said that $25 million of the linked-quarter increase this quarter, there was also -- not only just BSA\/AML, but there is some CCAR-related -- I mean, I guess in the $25 million, I guess, the CCAR, we'd start to see that drop off as we get past the first quarter of '14, right? So is there a way to kind of parse out how much of that CCAR may go away as we look into the sequential quarters?","Rene F. Jones","I kind of look at it almost on the same time line as the BSA\/AML, because don't think about submissions. Think about building of -- so, Brian, think about banks and their asset liability process, which they can run very routinely every month or as frequently as they want. We're in the process of building the infrastructure to stabilize that. So it's not about the submission as much as it is about building a sustainable, repeatable process that has as much integrity as your ALM, which, of course, has been around for decades, right? So I think that'll -- we'll continue to spend and invest there probably on the same path as what you're seeing on the BSA\/AML. But then again, that should taper off, particularly in the professional services side.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I guess just one quick one, and I'll get back in the queue. With the accretable yield that was in the NII this quarter?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. That number, I think, was $64 million or something, down from $70 million.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","$71-ish million.","Rene F. Jones","$71-ish million, that's the number I was going to say.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And again, Mike Pinto has always been a good friend and a mentor for me and so our prayers are with him and his family.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just go along with me for a minute here. Let's assume, for argument's sake, that in 2014 you hit all your targets on BSA\/AML, you get the CCAR system where you want it. When you get to 2015, and let's put Hudson City aside, what's either an expense dollar run rate level or sort of an efficiency ratio target that you think you can run M&T at for 2015?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, that's a good way to ask a question, Keith. I mean, I just think in terms of the efficiency ratio because we're always either expanding businesses or in some cases adding regions. So you saw we are at 56.2%, both this year, full year and last year, and that really is a reflection of sort of a new regulatory environment and the building of our infrastructure after the sort of growth spurt that we've had. Like -- I think we did something like 4, 5 acquisitions recently. So we've always felt that operating the efficiency ratio below that level was something that was very doable. We've actually run 50% to 55%, somewhere in that range, for a long period of time. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be back in those levels, but it's going to get there not necessarily by just saying that you're going to cut some expenses, because you do have a new infrastructure. But think of, for example, as we achieved, whatever time period, what we're doing with the BSA\/AML and building out the system, that's a process that's almost pure 100% leverageable, right, as we bring in new accounts, new volume and so forth. So one of the reasons why we are so confident in making a lot of these investments across the board and the data centers and all the other technology initiatives is, we think, over time, these are very leverageable and they'll position us well to sort of get back to the same space in the low-50s that we've always operated the institution at. I feel pretty confident that, that's very doable.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on capital allocation, in the past, if you went through a patch of slow loan growth or where the risk reward on loans wasn't so great, you could go and buy back your stock, sort of at will. Given where we are in the regulatory world right now, when you're in a situation like that, what's the new default position of what to do with capital? And as you think about the return ROTE potential for M&T, how much has it changed from where you are in the environment?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, yes. Over many, many years that was always the governor, right, you could just sort of simply be very disciplined and say, \"Okay, well, I don't have use for it because things are very frothy and I'll give back the capital.\" So I think you're right. I think in fact, I think that's one of the reasons why you see that the loan pricing and, now, loan structures are so competitive because there's not really an alternative use. It's also one of the reasons which makes us very comfortable to sort of make these correct investments, right? But there is no answer to your question. I mean, you -- I think if we can utilize that capital well and put it in the right places over the course of like last year, this year, I think that will be one set. And then, pass then, our capital ratio is now 9.25%, they're kind of getting up there again. So down the road in the future, we'll have to see how that changes. But one thing is for certain, I mean, you may see us -- if the loan growth is actually maybe X-minus because we're not really interested in sort of chasing some of the stuff that we see out there today, particularly in terms of structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, I just was hoping you could talk maybe a little bit about the loan growth outlook. I know you guys said low- to mid-single digits and that seems a little slower than some of the other banks are talking about. I think you also mentioned in your introductory comments that you've seen some of the commercial real estate lending in New York become more competitive. I'm curious what you mean by that and how you're thinking about the loan growth outlook.","Rene F. Jones","Yes. I'm pretty optimistic on the commercial side. There's nothing that we've seen, at least from an industry standpoint that suggest that commercial loan growth is slowing. In fact, it's the opposite. So we've had healthy C&I growth. I would expect that to continue and easily could be a little bit higher. We saw some pay-downs in CRE. So the normal trend to me would suggest continued growth. And in fact, if you kind of look at our numbers by category and in total relative to the industry, I think we're -- we've been higher than the industry in C&I, we've been maybe a little lower in CRE, we've been -- actually had less runoff in home equity, right? So we're probably positioned well relative to the industry. The thing that does bug us a little bit is in some places, pockets, you just see behavior that, quite frankly, the loan pricing didn't make sense that -- it wouldn't have made sense back in 2005 before we had the higher capital, before we had the higher liquidity. And in many cases in some of our markets, you see it in some of the smaller firms who were not necessarily accounting for those types of things. So I think that's one factor that could dampen the growth a bit. But in New York, it was interesting. I mean, if you go back maybe a year ago, maybe 1.5 years ago, all that during that period, it was the one place where pricing was very, very rational. There were actually only a few players and the behavior seemed to be maybe the most rational in all of our footprint. Now you're seeing, again, the conduits are resurging. You're seeing insurance companies come in. And in the past quarter, it was a space where there were a lot of examples of just longer structures, 7 years plus, and very, very thin pricing. So I mean, we report what we see and we kind of monitor it. I felt pretty good actually about the fact that it was a little slow. We actually, because of that, we saw some pay-downs, right? There were some things we're sort of refinancing out during the quarter in New York City. So that's what we know.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had one follow-up question. Ren\u00e9, if I understood you correctly, your guidance for less NIM compression this year than last does not include the liquidity build that you have to do it to be LCR-compliant based on the current proposal?","Rene F. Jones","That's correct. And we did it that way because when we think of what we have to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio and we look at the income impact, they're very -- there's very little, if any, income impact. So really, what you're doing is sort of putting on a leverage with no impact on interest income, sort of take down your printed net interest margin.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just as we think through it, how -- is it going to be a gradual building your securities book throughout the year or is it something you might front-load towards the beginning of the year?","Rene F. Jones","Right, that will frontline. It will be in the market. You'll see it every quarter where it'll be relatively steady and consistent.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just as a follow-up question to Keith, you mentioned a 56% efficiency ratio or something that is achievable near-term. Is it unreasonable for us to say that M&T can get -- M&T standalone will operate at 56% for full year 2015?","Rene F. Jones","I mean, is it unreasonable? I don't -- I mean, we tend to think longer-term, 2015 is a long way away. I don't know. Normal efficiency ratios for us would be low -- in the mid-levels. But as we're done with our work and we start to leverage that structure and the new infrastructure, I'd be surprised if we weren't below 55%. Below that, 50% to 55%, somewhere in that range. It's where we've always been. And as you think about it, and particularly, depending on what type of institution that we have, one of the things you're going to see, again, because of liquidity coverage ratio, if we were at 56% and if you think of all these things that we've got to do with liquidity, that ratio, I'm not so sure that, that just doesn't come down because structurally right, we're a different institution. So -- but I think we've got a long way to go. We have a good track record, and you kind of see it. If I were looking at it, I'd go back in history and look at where we've been, and that's what I'd probably use as my benchmark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Thompson with Portales Partners.","Jennifer A. Thompson - Portales Partners, LLC","Just a couple of questions on C&I. If you could give us the line utilization rates or the trend you're seeing there. And was there anything discernible in terms of the growth in C&I through the quarter? In other words, was there ramp-up at the end of the year or was it pretty consistent throughout the quarter?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, great. I'll go in reverse again. There definitely was ramp-up towards the end of the year. I think most of our loan growth was accounted for in the month of December. From November 30 to December 31, we had about $700 million of growth in C&I. And then when we look at sort of -- that's on the balance sheet. And when we look at sort of the pipeline, loan growth -- loan production, so new loans that went through our senior loan committee were lower than a year ago, but a year ago, it was abnormal and they were above average and consistent with any fourth quarter we've -- any of the better fourth quarters we've seen in the past. So I think that kind of speaks to the idea that I wouldn't expect a slowing of commercial loan growth. In terms of utilization, we are somewhere 57%, 58%. That has been rising fairly consistently over the course of 2013. So in fact, if you look at that trend, it's an upward trend, it's a straight line. So again, it gives you some sense that the idea that you would expect C&I to start slowing at this point probably doesn't make much sense.","Jennifer A. Thompson - Portales Partners, LLC","And that 57%, 58% that you're running, has it been -- I mean, what's kind of the pace -- what was it last quarter? Is it going up a percentage or so every quarter or what?","Rene F. Jones","It's gone up a very little bit, but very slowly. So if you go back a year ago, maybe that number was -- if it's 58% now, maybe that was 55%. If you go back a year before that, it might have been in the low-50s, 50%. Fairly steady, slow pace, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess, as I think about BSA\/AML, I mean, I think as analysts, yes, we've talked about it like we know what we're talking about. But like, what does a BSA\/AML best-in-class system actually entail? Is it mostly about technology or is it adding people? Like you get the consulting to build it upfront, but when you're done, do you end up with a tech system or is it more people? And is there any benefit beyond compliance? Is it really just compliance or is there some other things from a business perspective that it helps you with or lets you do?","Rene F. Jones","So, Brian, again, it's a good -- great question, the way you phrase it. Let me do my best. So first of all, it's not just technology, it's people, heavily people incentive and training people and training people to know the customer. So if you think about it, what we're doing -- one of the first -- one of the most fundamental things is we're building a risk rating system that allows us to be very sensitive and knowledgeable about when patterns change, and that might indicate that someone's engaging in some illicit activity or money-laundering. And to do that equally across all of our footprints and actually through each of the channels in which we interact with our customers. So to do that, on the system side, there's a fair amount of just data capture. And capturing that information is not necessarily just standard information, you're trying to make sure that you have access to information that allows you to do a great job of being predictive. So it's not a onetime thing. Predicting customer behavior is sort of changing all the time and so these models are relatively complex. So in order to do that, what you've got to do is you've got to identify the information you need, you've got to train your customer-facing employees on exactly what that information is and how to go about capturing it. And then you've got to interact with all of your customers, both the existing customers and the new ones through the account opening process to begin to capture that information. But remember, you've got to capture that information in a very accurate, consistent way. So you're not only -- you're not sitting in some back-office somewhere building a computer. It's touching every aspect of our business and particularly, the aspects that address our customers. And so, we've seen this happen before. We've seen places that have done it in a way where there's been a lot of disruption in the markets to their customers. We're trying to balance all that, and at the same time, we're trying to sort of aggressively be sort of best-in-class in terms of having predictive models that will allow us to monitor for illicit behavior. So if you think about it, it's pretty complex. If you are really, really good at systems, that would be one thing. And not good with people, I think you'd have a problem. So the quality of your people, the quality of your sales force, as well as the technology and the data are all key elements.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, on your LCR ratio that you talked about, and you may have mentioned it and I kind of overlooked it, what's the dollar amount do you think you need to buy in terms of liquid securities to get you up to the level that you need to get to?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, we haven't disclosed that yet, Gerard. And I think over the course of this year, you saw in some of the moves we made, particularly in the second quarter and then in the third, and I think those began to get us in a good range to be able to kind of meet the requirements. I think it's fair to say that we still have a fair amount to do at the sort of manageable amount that we would do through the course of the year. But we really haven't talked about the amount. In part, we're not talking about the amount because remember that the rules of the NPR is sort of not final. And one of the things that happen in the fall, in my opinion, was that maybe it seems that it came out to be a little bit more stringent than we were thinking. So as it stands as it is, we have more work to do. But I think you'll see it, you'll get a feel for it as we get to the -- through the end of the first quarter.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And stepping back from the BSA\/AML, the revamping of your systems that you're doing, how much did your acquisition strategy over the years -- obviously, you've done a number of acquisitions very successfully, how much did that kind of complicate the situation versus if you were just a legacy M&T Bank, the legacy bank in Buffalo?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. I mean, I think, one of the -- let me put it this way, one of the things that has positioned us extremely well is this philosophy that we've had for many, many years that when we do an acquisition, our preference would be to do it a simultaneous close and integration, right? And when doing that, we end up putting everything on M&T's system. And so from a systems and information standpoint, that's helped us very well as you kind of go through the years and think of the transactions that we've done. Wilmington was a little different in part because we, the bank part, which was really quite frankly the smaller part, was smooth and easily integrated in a very short time period, I think that same summer that we did the close. Whereas, if you think of the trust business, the wealth and institutional services, we were really taking a lot of the quality and attributes that were already existing at Wilmington and bringing the M&T piece into the fold. So that was relatively new. So I think, you've seen that. That's taken us longer on the Wilmington side to sort of get to what we would call a steady state. Having said that, particularly over the last 6 months, we feel really good. We feel really good about the work we've done on the control environment and how we've stabilized that. So if you think of that as 2013, we announced that deal in 2010. So typically, that's longer. But aside from Wilmington, I think the way we've been able to do things to keep them simple, to have not duplicate systems probably has allowed us to make these investments and have them be much more productive than not. So we're not consolidating processing centers. We're not -- if you remember, a bunch of us in 2004 and 2005, when we were complaining about the revenue growth, that's actually what we were doing. We were looking at all the capture centers and we were doing all that kind of work. This is the third time that we've gone through an experience like this. One was after the 1991, '92 -- when I joined the bank, we were ramping up all the systems, we called it future solutions, we spent tremendous amount of money there. We also did the same with the projects I just mentioned to you in 2004 and 2005, and now, we're doing it again. So I think this is what you've got to do every period, after you go through a period of growth. If you don't do it, things could get out of control.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No doubt, no doubt. Regarding your agreement with the regulators, do you think, I mean, after -- when you finish all your BSA\/AML stuff, do you think that for you to complete the Hudson City acquisition that, that agreement has to be lifted?","Rene F. Jones","I think we've got to make progress on getting consumer to that best practice BSA\/AML system. And we've got to allow the regulators to have enough time to be able to say that we've got an adequate system. Lifting of orders and all that, we have no control over that. And there's a history that says those things take much longer. So I think we're just really very -- our thinking is really it's about BSA\/AML.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally coming back to capital, excess capital. Obviously, M&T has demonstrated over the years as being a very good steward on taking care of excess capital and delivering it to shareholders. Assuming that the regional banks like your own are required to carry the 7% Tier 1 common ratio, maybe there's a domestic buffer of 25 or 50 basis points, and I would assume that you guys want to keep another buffer on top of that. Do you think that after you use your money for growth, what's left over will -- you will maintain that philosophy or the board will maintain the philosophy that you've had in the past in giving that excess capital back to shareholders?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, I think at some point, that's right. I mean, I think -- and keep in mind, our situation, we've got to where we are in an efficient manner, right? We're 9.25. And you can see that other institutions are all giving back capital and doing appropriate levels of repurchases and those things. So it's not as if that has been eliminated from the banking industry. I think as I think about it, right, if you think of all the things that we've -- that have been part of our value proposition, acknowledging that we sell commodities and making sure that we have a low-cost, controlled environment, keeping everything relatively simple. To me, now that everybody has to carry more equity, those things are even more important to be able to carry that through. And then at some point in time, as you get excess capital, yes, the only choice you really have is to give it back in some efficient form.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, I just wanted to go back to the Hudson City just for a moment. As you mentioned, the board has again met in December, put out a statement, including a comment that it was, I believe, unlikely the transaction, I believe, would close by the end of the second quarter. I'm just wondering in terms of -- you're very focused on developing or building out kind of a best-in-class enterpriser's management system. And I'm just kind of thinking -- I'm trying to think about whether or not -- are the companies on a dual track system such that they're very much still moving forward in terms of wanting to complete the deal, but by the same token, you're continuing to move forward in terms of your risk management process? I'm just trying to figure out if -- basically, it seems as almost the agreement is becoming -- it has become an agreement in principle, such that when the stars align sometime in the future, the boards will revisit the transaction and determine whether or not it makes sense.","Rene F. Jones","I thought I had you, Todd, in the beginning, but then I think I lost you at the end. So I'll go with the one from the beginning. I think, look, put Hudson City aside for a minute. We are among the smallest of the banks that are above $50 billion. We tend to think long-term. So regardless of any specific merger transaction, we think in order to survive and be around, you've got to have a pretty strong infrastructure. And we also think that as we move forward further and further along, what's really happening is that there are a lot of barriers to entries being set up. So in our mind, these investments that we're making, particularly in risk management, don't relate to any one particular transaction. So the second part of that would be that once we complete that, it's not that we're sort of running to -- I see what you mean by dual tracks now. From a risk management perspective, it would plug into Hudson City and there's no incremental, whatsoever, associated with it. The dual tracking is sort of -- I mean, at the end of the day, the environment's uncertain and it makes sense for them to go down a path to make sure that they have alternatives in the event that we can't sort of do the partnership that we want to do. So I think that's all that they were saying. And under the sort of regulatory regime and their particular regulators, they've got to continue to make progress to be safe and sound if for some reason that they have to go on their own. But as we complete the merger, yes, I mean, there's no incremental cost to run Hudson City given what its portfolio and mix are. And that's what -- why you get a lot of leverage out of these investments we're making.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, I can appreciate that. That's helpful. I'm just wondering whether or not, again, you think about the period of time that's elapsed since the deal was initially announced, the time where the initial due diligence was completed. And it just seems like at some point we can get back to a situation where we have to revisit with shareholders and think about the economics of the transaction and whether or not it really makes sense at some point in time.","Rene F. Jones","We reviewed all the economics of it. We're economic animals. Really, we reviewed all the economics of the deal and I'm absolutely positive that Hudson City did the same. And it just makes sense, it didn't make sense for 1 quarter, it made sense. So putting those 2 institutions together, that -- all that value is there. Nothing has changed at all. And both parties kind of weighed that out and are very committed to the transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah with Albert Fried.","Sachin Shah","My question is about Hudson, in fact, again. So I know you're trying to set the foundation here on this AML, you reiterated in various ways. But -- so from that perspective, before you can move on and even have the regulators look at the Hudson bank situation and actually approve it and allow it to move forward, is there any specific timing on this now, relative to the previous statement that you guys put out on extending the termination date, et cetera?","Rene F. Jones","The only thing that's out there that is public is our written agreement and it kind of lays out everything that we've got to do. And we've sort of talked about the progress we want to make in terms of this year and we've talked about the spending patterns. So with all that together, you can get a good sense. I mean, sending it down to a specific day is not, really, how we think about it.","Sachin Shah","So -- but the timing is you're -- sometime in the second quarter of this year that you're expecting maybe some progress?","Rene F. Jones","I don't think I can add anything beyond I've already noted through the course of the call.","Sachin Shah","Okay. And as far as Hudson bank, so just to reiterate that the commitment is there on both boards to continue, as outlined, the merger agreement and the amendment of that to basically merge? Is that -- I just want to solidify those comments.","Rene F. Jones","No, I mean, I think just go back and read the press release because we're all very enthusiastic about doing the transaction, each of us individually and together. There's sort of no question in our minds and I think that was evident in the actions that both boards took. So we are very enthusiastic about -- once we get all our work done, continuing on with that process.","Sachin Shah","Okay. Just one follow-up question. And so, aside from this AML situation, is there any -- so if you resolve this, when you resolve this, it's more of a when you resolve it situation. Because as you said early on, you're thinking more long term about the bank, M&T, which makes sense. But when you resolve that, when you resolve that, do you believe there is any other -- there are reasons why the regulators, especially the fed, would say, \"You resolved this, but now you still can't do this transaction.\"","Rene F. Jones","If you spend any time around these processes, I mean, really, what happens is that you do your best to have both partners have the right intent, which we have here. We think we've got a transaction that creates a lot of value and then you have your application process go through. We don't influence the application process. We don't influence future events. We don't influence the state of the economy, as that will happen going forward. All we know is that the 2 management teams are really committed to producing a strong bank in New Jersey, right? That's all we know.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rupert with CIBC Asset Management.","Adam Rupert","Ren\u00e9, through the acquisition of Wilmington Trust, you guys are required a number of investor managers, including a couple of equity stakes and some smaller boutique managers, such as Roxbury Capital and Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn. Can you comment on M&T's strategic vision for the investment management arm of the bank in general and maybe these 2 assets specifically?","Rene F. Jones","Well, I mean, other than -- they are great partners and we're very pleased with every aspect of the Wilmington transaction and the partnership we've got. But other than that, there's really nothing to talk about there.","Adam Rupert","Is growing boutique investment managers underneath the umbrella of Wilmington Trust, something that would be in the strategic plan for the future?","Rene F. Jones","I don't think that, that's necessarily the way we think about the growth in the Wilmington business is in platforms. I think that on the ICS and trust business, that's a whole different ballgame in the types of clients and services that we're providing. And then on the Wilmington side, really, our leverage is all about introducing the strong and talented team that's there to our customers. So we're not sort of focused on the idea that we would need to have more of those types of relationships in order to sort of provide good customer value.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Herz with the OppenheimerFunds.","Robert Herz","Ren\u00e9, I was wondering if you could talk about the trust preferreds and how you have a $350 million one at 8.5% that I think you were approved to replace with other capital? And then there's like $367 million of other trust preferreds, which are currently callable, they just became callable this month.","Rene F. Jones","Yes, so on the $350 million that you mentioned, now, when we submitted our capital plan last year, we got approval to replace those through -- that approval lasts through the end of the first quarter here. So it is our intention to do that, and we'll probably use that piece as a replacement with a full preferred. And then the rest of the stuff, it depends -- and we've talked about this a little bit, some of it is actually closed at very low rates and so it will probably end up...","Robert Herz","Right, I excluded the low-rate stuff. I just gave the things that are all over 8% because there are all those floating rate things.","Rene F. Jones","Yes, so that's -- the remaining amount that, probably not in the near term but down the road as our capital structure firms up, we would then obviously look to do something. But we're not looking to do anything with that sort of sub set that you just talked about in the near term.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, just a quick follow-up. So I guess one, congratulations on your promotion, but to me, I'm just wondering if you can let us know, I guess, what -- with all the additional responsibilities you're taking on now as the Vice Chairman at M&T and now running the wealth management Wilmington Trust lines of business, I guess just talk about your expectations and what we can expect to -- how that will impact you going forward.","Rene F. Jones","Well, in near term, I don't expect that you'll notice any changes. I think that with regard to the whole announcement, I hope you would see with Mark and Kevin and some of the other names that you have heard or will continue to hear, that we've got a really, really deep bench. And with respect to Wilmington, as I said, that team is very, very strong. It's got strong leadership. And now, we've sort of gotten to a place where we've gotten to a very stable environment. And so, I think our forward-looking view of the Wilmington businesses is that, we should be able now to sort of kind of go full steam ahead and integrate that into all the opportunities that we have across our core footprint on the wealth side and maybe beyond that with respect to the institutional businesses. So my job is to help out in any capacity that I can, and I'm sure you'll probably hear more about that as we kind of move forward.","Operator","And that was our final question, and I'd like to turn the floor back over to Don MacLeod for any additional or closing remarks.","Donald J.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Donald J. MacLeod","","Thank you, Paula, and good morning everyone. This is Don MacLeod. I'd like to thank everybody for participating in M&T's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our Web-site, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Rene Jones.","Rene F. Jones","","Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Our results for this quarter were strong and relatively straightforward. As we noted in the press release, we experienced an uptick in customer activity during the second quarter from what had been an unusually slow first quarter.","In addition to an uptick in loan growth, the improvement was reflected in our Wilmington Trust fee businesses and mortgage banking as well as deposit service charges. Credit metrics remained solid and M&T's balance sheet measures continue to strengthen. Operating expenses remained elevated as we continue to make significant progress on our regulatory initiatives including BSA\/AML compliance and our overall risk management activities.","As we usually do, I'll start by reviewing a few of the highlights from M&T's second quarter results, after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions. Looking at the numbers, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the second quarter of 2014, improved from $1.61 in the first quarter but down from $2.55 in the second quarter of 2013. Net income for the recent period was $284 million, increased from $229 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $348 million in the year ago quarter.","Noteworthy items included in the second quarter's results were an $8 million reduction in M&T's accrual for income taxes, which followed resolution with the taxing authorities of previously uncertain tax position, and a $12 million addition to M&T's litigation reserve which amounts to $7 million after tax. Prior to M&T's acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation, the SEC commenced a civil investigation of Wilmington Trust financial reporting and securities filing. The addition to the reserve reflects our belief that we are nearing resolution of this matter. We have worked diligently to resolve some of the legacy issues while we continue to build on Wilmington Trust's historic strength, both in the Delaware community and in the wealth and investment services space.","Recall that results for the second quarter of 2013 included securities gains and reversal of a contingent compensation accrual that in aggregate increased net income by $49 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.38. Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $6 million or $0.04 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $6 million and $0.05 per share in the prior quarter.","M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $290 million, up from $235 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $2.02 for the recent quarter, up from $1.66 in the linked quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible asset and average tangible common equity of 1.35% and 14.92% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.15% and 12.76% in the first quarter of 2014. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $675 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $13 million from the linked quarter. The increase was attributable to higher levels of loans and investment securities as well as an additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin was 3.40% during the quarter, down 12 basis points, compared with 3.52% in the first quarter.","During the period, we had a particularly high level of short-term trust demand deposit, primarily related to our institutional trust business which we had held at the Federal Reserve. On an average basis, the deposit of excess funds at the Fed was some $1 billion higher in the second quarter than in the first. This temporary elevation of excess funds diluted the margin by an estimated 4 basis points during the quarter.","We estimate that the impact from a higher level of investment securities combined with higher level of borrowings reduced the margin by about 5 basis points, and finally the remaining 3 basis points of margin compression represents our estimated core margin pressure which includes the impact of new loans coming on at rates lower than those that are maturing.","Average loans increased 579 million or 4% annualized during the quarter. Average commercial industrial loans or those loans to support business operations grew a healthy 11% annualized \u2013 at a healthy 11% annualized rate. We saw a strong double-digit growth in greater New York City, in Pennsylvania and in the Mid-Atlantic region.","Average commercial real estate loans were essentially flat to the first three months of this year. As has been the case for the past several quarters, origination activity remained steady or perhaps a little better than steady, while high levels of paydowns particularly in our New York City region have offset new originations. The elevated level of paydowns reflects the availability of long-term low cost permanent financing from both bank and non-bank competitors at terms we were unwilling to match.","Residential mortgage loan volume declined an annualized 4%. Average consumer loans grew an annualized 7% with good growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans, being partially offset by declines in home equity loan.","The $1.7 billion increase in investment securities that I mentioned represents the continuation of our program to build a liquid asset buffer in preparation for the implementation of the liquidity coverage ratio. Average core customer deposits, which excludes deposits received in M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, grew at an annualized rate of 14% from the first quarter, reflecting the elevated level of trust demand deposits I referred to earlier. Those deposits were lower again at the end of the quarter.","Turning to noninterest income, noninterest income totaled $456 million in the second quarter, improved from $420 million in the prior quarter. There were no securities gains or losses in either period. Mortgage banking revenues were $96 million in the recent quarter, up 20% from $80 million in the prior quarter. The higher revenues in comparison to the linked quarter reflect improved origination activity as well as the sale of re-performing government guaranteed loan.","Commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale increased 24%, applications were up 27%, closings were up 31%, and the pipeline which is a reflection of as we move into future quarters was up 18%. Now recall that the first quarter's results reflected lower-than-expected levels of activity. The stronger trend seen during the recent quarter likely includes some level of pent-up demand from the first quarter, and given that we expect mortgage banking revenues over the remainder of 2014 will be somewhat lower.","Commercial gain on sale revenues in the mortgage space improved by $3 million compared with the first quarter, reflecting higher volumes of commercial mortgage loans originated for sale. Fee income from deposit service charges provided were $107 million in the second quarter compared with $104 million in the linked quarter, reflecting higher levels of customer activity.","Trust and investment revenues which include fees from wealth management and institutional trust services were $130 million, up from $120 million in the prior quarter. Net new business and seasonal tax preparation fees were the primary drivers of the increase.","Turning to operating expenses, operating expenses for the second quarter which exclude expenses from the amortization of intangible assets was $672 million, down by $20 million from the $692 million in the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits declined to $340 million, down $32 million, reflecting a return to normal levels of spending from the seasonally high levels incurred during the first quarter. This decline was moderated by the impact from an additional compensation day in the quarter.","Other cost of operations increased by $17 million from the previous quarter. The increase is primarily due to the $12 million addition to the litigation reserve that I mentioned previously. Expenses arising from our work on BSA\/AML compliance initiative remain elevated and I'll discuss our spending outlook in a few minutes.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses as well as intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was 59.4% for the second quarter compared with 63.9% in the prior quarter. The improvement reflects the lower spending levels combined with stronger revenue trend.","Next let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains strong and in line with our expectation. Nonaccrual loans decreased slightly from the end of the first quarter. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined by 3 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the second quarter. When we file our 10-Q in the coming weeks, I expect that we'll report a continued decline in classified loans.","Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $29 million, down from $32 million in the first quarter, and that is an annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans ratio were 18 basis points for the second quarter, improved slightly from 20 basis points in the previous quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $30 million for the recent quarter and the allowance for credit losses was $918 million amounting to 1.42% of total loans as of the end of June. The loan loss allowance as of the June 30 was 7.5 times annualized charge-offs. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition were $289 million at the end of the quarter. Of these, 95% are guaranteed by government related entities. Accruing loans 90 days past due were $307 million at the end of the first quarter, of which 95% were also guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital, our Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 9.62% at the end of June, up 17 basis points from 9.45% at the end of March. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 under the recently adopted Basel III capital rules is approximately 9.35%. Tangible book value per share increased by 4% from the prior quarter to $55.89.","Turning to the outlook, as I mentioned at the outset, customer activity picked up quite a bit from the levels we saw in the first quarter for both the balance sheet and most fee income categories. Regarding loan growth, we're encouraged by the continued or perhaps even improved momentum in C&I lending and we expect continued pressure on pricing and structures in the CRE space. We continue to expect modest ongoing core compression in the net interest margin of 2 to 3 basis points per quarter. Beyond the core margin, we also expect additional pressure in the printed margin as we take further steps towards reaching our compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio by the end of this year, and we continue to expect growth in net interest income for the remainder of the year.","As noted, we expect lower mortgage banking revenues over the second half of the year. This should be somewhat offset by continued growth in other fee categories. Expenses remain elevated, near current levels, for the next couple of quarters as we continue to make investments on our regulatory and other operational initiatives. We currently expect to see improvement in spending as we begin to move into 2015, and the outlook for credit remains stable and there are no signs of a turn-in in asset quality metrics.","Lastly, on our BSA\/AML initiative, we've made significant progress on the series of milestones that are needed to enhance M&T's BSA\/AML compliance program. M&T has substantially improved its governance, training and management reporting board's compliance with BSA\/AML laws and regulations. A new 'Know Your Customer' program has been implemented. All new customers are being brought into the Bank through this new set of Bank-wide procedures, customer due diligence and the risk weighting process. Application of the new 'Know Your Customer' protocol to existing customers continues. The third-party vendor for a transaction review called for in the written agreement has begun its work, and as of the end of the second quarter, 571 employees are devoting a majority of their time to BSA\/AML activity. This does not include part-time or contract employees. Said another way, we're working diligently to address all of the issues raised by the Federal Reserve in the written agreement.","Overall, of course as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR Capital.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital","You talked about the expenses as we head to the next several quarters and hen said that you expect some improvements in spending as we head into 2015. Could you just help us think about to what extent expenses will actually improve or to what extent sort of will you be able to leverage the expense base where it is or how you're thinking about the expense trajectory just for the M&T piece excluding any Hudson City impact?","Rene F. Jones","At a very high level, I think what I said was what we expect, that I don't expect to see any significant improvement in the level of expenses that we're running at in the next quarter or so. We may begin to see some as we get into the fourth quarter but I think most of the benefit \u2013 as we talked last quarter, we said we try to position ourselves for 2015. I do see sort of a natural progression of lower expenses that would come through throughout 2015. And the way to think about that is in a couple of buckets that a whole group of people that are just sort of thinking about outside of the risk management and compliance base, how we can do things more efficiently, I talked about that last time. So that's beginning to get some traction but will take some time to produce result.","I think about \u2013 separate from all of the other risk management and all of the other technology type initiatives we're doing, if you just focus in on the BSA\/AML process for a minute, what we've done there is that we have taken some time to build up our core infrastructure, I talked about the components of governance and infrastructure that we're going. So that is all in place and up and running, but at the same time we've kept all of the ramped up professional services and contract employees and all of the external stuff that are not part of necessarily an ongoing process but more related to the remediation and getting up to speed. And to put that into perspective, I mean I think now the number has been creeping up a little bit but as I look at where I forecast where we'll be just on BSA\/AML spending alone, I think I'm pretty comfortable that we'll probably spend over $150 million in 2014 on that number.","So that gives you some sense of how much effort we're putting into the process. So naturally, we are going to do that for as long as it takes to get our work done, but clearly we are well above a sustainable level that you would see on an ongoing basis, and so that's what gives me comfort that as we get more towards and into 2015, then we get through the bulk of our work in a satisfactory way, that you have downward pressure.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital","And so if you spend $150 million in 2014, once you're all up and running and you've been able to let go some of the external services, what do you think that number is in 2016, I mean taking it further out?","Rene F. Jones","I don't know, I really don't know. I think that's extraordinary amount of money. I think we begin to think about all of our risk management spending in total, I think that's how we have to think about it. But what I do know is if you think about the numbers we've been giving you, last quarter I think we said 425 employees we had on there, we have 571 employees, we're just going to have to figure out what that happy space is. Part of that space is dictated by what we find in terms of the risk profile of the Company or more so in the risk profile of the customers and then we'll decide from there, but what I do know is that we have ramped up the portion of the spending that's coming from the outside to help us get through the work.","Donald J. MacLeod","We'll know more as we go.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital","And how much of that 150 is internal versus external?","Donald J. MacLeod","I don't have it at the top of my head. I probably have it somewhere around here but \u2013 I mean you look at the professional services, huge amounts are in professional services, and I think as you think over that's where you should see the improvement.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital","Okay great. One other question, shifting gears, if you think about the efforts prepare for the LCR requirements, where are you guys in terms of where you want the balance sheet to be and how much more do you expect to add in terms of high quality Ginnie Mae securities to meet the requirements?","Rene F. Jones","We have more to do. I think that the way to think about it is I would expect what we saw this quarter, we wish to see similar quarters going forward, we will be done by the end of year, there's no question about that. We did 1.9 billion of purchases this quarter. I think we did 1.7 billion last quarter. So we're sort of on track and our thought process is full compliance, we're not looking at the phase-in stuff but we're talking about 100%.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital","Okay great. And so I guess so we can expect a similar impact to margin, obviously goes from how will be the impact on net interest income, but on margin from the security purchase over the next several quarters?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, I think that's very logical, very logical.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","Can you just touch on some of the balance sheet positioning that you've done, obviously some of which LCR related, but is there anything you've done, I looked at the decline let's say in one-to-four family loans this quarter in preparation for the pending Hudson City deal?","Rene F. Jones","No, no, we're not doing \u2013 we didn't undertake any activities that we don't normally do, and you're mostly seeing a runoff in that portfolio and it doesn't make any sense to begin to obtain more mortgages because of Hudson City, but there's nothing unusual there.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. And then just focusing on New Jersey, can you give us a sense of if you're losing money there right now, how much are you losing and how much easier would your life be or will it be if you have branches and how you've been able to be successful so far without them?","Rene F. Jones","I love your question, I like it in reverse better. Let me start by saying that on its own, the novel approach is not one where you're going to make money in the outset. It's just you got to build up an infrastructure, you have to have enough identity because you've got all of the infrastructure that you need to put in place but you don't have the customer base, and that takes some time, and our thinking was that we probably would never really bench it out there doing that on our own without Hudson, but we now have gone through that experiment.","First, it's really, it's been just a pleasant surprise. The team has worked really, really well together, it's way ahead of what we would've thought the profitability would have been today, and so we've learned some stuff, and we're getting traction and being received really well with the customer base. So, I think I may have mentioned it at some point in time, we probably have I don't know $802 billion balance sheet in New Jersey, and not only that, it's very well-rounded with a wealth team and a securities team.","So, I think we're off to a better-than-expected start there and I guess if you were thinking about it, as changing your mind about the novel, you probably would have lower expenses, but I don't think that's \u2013 that's not where we're going. We like what we see there.","So the one thing I would talk about in terms of the way we modelled Hudson City is when we talked about expense days. Those expense days were net of all those hires that we've already made, right. So just keep that in mind, right. So I think you're kind of getting there that the weight of bringing on all those staff is already in our numbers and it's already there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Rene, just to follow up on sort of the medium term expense reduction, I just want to understand \u2013 to make sure I understand the source, is that coming from just lesser outside consultants and technology and that kind of thing or is it coming from the fact that that 571 number of individuals committed to that today will ultimately be a much lesser number?","Rene F. Jones","I think the space that I'm focused on given what I do is I clearly see the professional services with the people who are here helping us learn the process or doing the third-party reviews, right. So that's very clear to me. I think on the staffing side, we have to kind of think about that because beyond \u2013 remember the way I discussed the people that we have, in addition to that we have all those contract folks. So, there's a lot more people actually working on than all those 571 individuals. We'll just have to wait and see, I mean I don't want to \u2013 I don't know that we know enough to know what's required to sustain the program but our focus is going to be on sustaining a very strong program.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And if you were to sort of categorize which inning you were with respect to fulfilling the terms laid out in the written agreement, where would you say, are we sixth inning or later or earlier?","Rene F. Jones","I'm not a keeper of that. The way I think about it is, I think that there are a bunch of steps but there are four that I think about. One is the governance and the infrastructure, and since you've known about this, that's what we've been building that in place now and we've done that work. Two is the 'Know Your Customer' and the risk rating model, and I mentioned that last time and you might have thought of that as sort of, okay, we've put it in place so we're done. That's not the way I think about it.","Now we actually have another full quarter of processing in that way, and as we get through that and as we get through the third piece that I look at which is the amount of customers that we remediated in our existing base, the more of that that we get through, what we do is that as we've begun to make that progress, it allows the Federal Reserve to have enough result so to speak to begin to examine our progress. And then when you think about that process, that sort of build, examine, reframe process, it's an iterative process and we learn from it. And so, it's really almost impossible to kind of give you a date, it doesn't work that way.","But what I feel good about is we've hit our target schedules, we're doing a fair amount of work, we're providing a lot of information for the regulatory folks to be able to see what we're doing and test and look at it, and that's what I feel good about.","The fourth piece is the look-back, and that is being done by an independent party. From everything we see, they are on track but that's their work that they have to get through, and then similarly the Federal Reserve has to have time to begin to look at their work.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Alright, great, and I appreciate that answer. And just lastly on the margin, all of the three or four components that you laid out as contributing to the compression in this period, it sounds like they all more or less remain in similar magnitudes at least over the next period, is that fair?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, I have thought about that a lot myself. It's been a long time and it's all been around two or three, but I think that's because the rate environment just hasn't changed, there hasn't been a lot of dynamic changes in our balance sheet and there's been no change in the rate environment. So I think it is moving along. Don always reminds me that embedded in that is of course the fact that our acquired loan portfolio is getting smaller, but that's embedded in the two or three points. So I think it's just that there's not been a lot of change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","I guess a couple of quick follow-ups, Rene. On the margin side, you did mention the acquired portfolio shrinking, you still have the accretable yield number for the second quarter?","Rene F. Jones","I do. Give me a second. I never give you the accretable yield, I give you the whole thing. So give me two seconds and I'll find it. What I will say is, if you look at that today where we sit, if you look at our yields, there's about 8 basis points of lift in our yields of our assets from the acquired portfolio. And then the interest on the acquired portfolio this quarter was $49 million interest income, $49 million, last quarter it was $59 million, quarter before it was $65 million.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. And as far as, is there typically around this period of time you actually sort of I guess true-up and reanalyze cash flow. Is it something you might do third and fourth quarter or is that\u2026?","Rene F. Jones","No, we do that every quarter, we do make a very \u2013 maybe a little bit of a heightened effort on the anniversary which you're right is here, and we did all that work and now we feel very comfortable with where our cash flows and estimates are, we think those are pretty good.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","And then I guess just thinking about the impact from the LCR efforts for the quarter, the average balances don't totally reflect where the end of period is, so could there be a little bit more carryover of compression into the third quarter before you kind of factor in the new LCR type leveraging you're going to add to in the third quarter? So should we expect a little bit more compression from just what you did during the second quarter?","Rene F. Jones","You're really good. So yes, I mean I think if you go from 1.7 to 1.9, there's probably \u2013 the 200 million is going to have a little bit more of an impact. I don' know how much that is, but yes, that's right. It depends on of course what we do in the third quarter.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Sure, as far as how fast you lever that in. And then I guess just last question, relative to where you are with BSA\/AML, I know you talked about spending $150 million, can you remind us kind of where you are so far or what you've spent in the quarter or anything you can kind of give us as to what you spent in the first half of the year?","Rene F. Jones","I hate forecasting in general. You're asking me to forecast like\u2026","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","No, no, I guess maybe just what you've spent already, so actual versus forecast.","Rene F. Jones","I don't know, I'll shy away from that. But I think you kind of get it because we're saying it's going to remain level, alright, and so we've been spending at this rate already. That's really where my forecast is coming from.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Got it. And I guess really the question really is, to kind of tack onto that is, with that kind of going pretty smooth like you just answered the previous question, I guess is the expectation still the same as far as timing for closing of Hudson City given that if everything is on track and continues to kind of move forward, do you still expect the closing here in the second half of the year, maybe late summer or fall, or I guess maybe what's your commentary regarding Hudson City closing?","Rene F. Jones","I don't really have any commentary. What I can say is that as we look at the \u2013 continue to monitor both portfolios, we still love the transaction and we've got an agreement that's in force until the end of the year. And other than that, we're just working really hard to make sure we do a good job on what the task at hand is, and if we do that then maybe there's some possibility that we'll be able to move on and do what we intend to do, but nothing's changed, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Rene, to your point on the loan growth and activity starting to pickup, previously you had talked about full-year loan growth in the low to mid single digits or mid if you adjusted for last year's securitization, I believe that was on a period end basis. Any updated thoughts on that type of growth pattern or growth rate expectation?","Rene F. Jones","I don't know, I think I wouldn't change it. I mean, so 11% annualized growth in C&I which is an uptick, zero in CRE, and across the board there continues to remain pricing pressure, each quarter is a little bit more structure pressure, and I think if you look at what's driving that, there's no change in the underlying issues. So I don't think it's going to \u2013 I think it's going to be tough, I think I would expect pricing continue to be under pressure, meaning that it's not staying at the same levels, it will come down.","I look back at a presentation that our commercial real estate folks did and it reminded me, we had in 2004, 2005 and 2006, our growth in commercial real estate was below the industry, and '07 and '08 it was about the same, and '09, '10, '11 and '12 we outpaced the industry in commercial real estate growth, and in '13 and '14 we're behind. I think that follows the price of the asset, alright. So we're finding it very difficult in terms of the competitiveness in that space and we're probably making a little bit more progress on the middle market space. I don't expect that to change.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, got you. And then Rene, on the investments that you're making, can you just give us kind of an understanding of where the stuff that you're buying in the portfolio, what that go on yields are versus your three unchanged average yield of the portfolio which the average portfolio has gone to?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, I mean almost everything is big, almost everything is 15 year in terms of maturity duration, and second quarter yield six roughly. I want to say our borrowings are somewhere around [1.4] (ph) from what we've been doing on the wholesale front.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Okay. And then just one small one for me, when you're talking about expenses being fairly flat from here for the back half of the year, are you talking of just the all-in reported number or would you be thinking of extra litigation charge?","Rene F. Jones","I guess I'm thinking all-in but I haven't really thought about that. I mean I guess we were a little elevated because of that. I don't know, you could go either way. It's sort of the trajectory I guess I'm thinking about.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, so it's in this zone, with not much change expected from how it came through, okay?","Rene F. Jones","That's what I'm thinking, yes.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","And then last little one is just, can you quantify for us the magnitude of those government guaranteed loan sales that helped the mortgage line?","Rene F. Jones","I mean the problem with that is, if you're looking at what you're trying to think about where mortgage banking revenue is going to go, I think you had that but I think you also had the pent-up demand. So what we're thinking is that, I mean we wouldn't be surprised to give back half of the improvement that we saw from the first to the second quarter. I think in combination you're going to see that reduce on the residential mortgage side.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Understood, that makes sense. Thanks Rene.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Jeffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","I've got another question on Hudson City. What is the earliest date that could close if everything went perfectly from now onwards, what is the earliest that that could close given you've got the BSA\/AML work still ongoing?","Rene F. Jones","I think everything we've said in the past gives you some sense of what we would hope for but that's all we know.","Jeffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","And then how easy would it be to push that into 2015?","Rene F. Jones","I think the thing to remember is, to this point that it really apply in this particular case, when we come together obviously we are very \u2013 we have a disciplined approach to the financials, but most of our \u2013 when we get together with somebody, most of those situations have been partnerships, and we only got to where we are today by each time an issue has come up, we sat down and asked people what they want to do and what was in their best interest, and this is how we got to where we are. So we would just have to do the same thing at the time.","We have a high amount of respect for the managements there and the Board at Hudson City. So whatever they need to do is what we're going to focus on first, and then what we know is that when and if something happens, that's what build a strong partnership. So we wouldn't even begin to think about that unless we got to that situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill [Kokesch] (ph) of Nomura.","Bill - Nomura","Rene, can you give a little bit more color around some of the things that you've done upfront to accelerate the integration of Hudson City and make sure that you hit the ground running post close and anything more that you can still do as we look forward from here?","Rene F. Jones","I think one of the things about what we would have to do is that it's very much in line with what they are required to do as well. So you've heard Ron talk about building out things that require the need for commercial lending and the infrastructure there, you've heard him talk about setting up an origination for sale with the Fannie and Freddie programs around that. So they're doing those things, those things are perfectly aligned with where we would go anyway.","And then we have obviously the balance sheet and the balance sheet issues of sort of taking maybe off the leverage there. What's interesting is that's naturally happening as we move forward, and so we understand the balance sheet, we monitor the balance sheet and we look at changes in those. As an example, we'll all be under liquidity coverage ratio. So as those types of things affect that balance sheet, we're both under the same steps.","Because it's such a large, a big part of this merger is repositioning our balance sheet, there are very financial type things to do. All of the stuff that we have to do or I should say a big portion of the things that we have to do outside of the branches are actually being done, right, and then we would have to begin to think about how we go back and ramp up, workaround branches and making sure the controls and things are in place there, but that stuff we know how to do and we really have not been focused on that because there's not a long runway to do that type of work should the opportunity avail itself. So there's not a lot of unique things that you've got to do in this type of a transaction.","Bill - Nomura","Okay. And following up on some of the comments you made now and what you said earlier about branch density, are you happy with where you'll be post close, in particular maybe relative to where you are in your other key markets and strategically how you think about that?","Rene F. Jones","I mean to think of it, let me go back, so we have about the same number of branches today as we did say five years ago and we've grown a lot. So we're always looking at our branch network and we're looking at sort of where the locations are and then more recently look how they are staffed and the technology that we're using. And so I got to believe that as we get to that space in New Jersey where we have branches, what we're thinking about is very much the same way, the number hasn't \u2013 I don't know that the number would be significantly different, we never plan to have fewer locations. I don't know if that helps but it's kind of what you do, you optimize in both, not just from an expense perspective but from a location and opportunity perspective.","Bill - Nomura","That's really helpful. Maybe just finally, if you could touch on a bit more of a macro question, would love to hear your thoughts on the whole notion of deposits leaving the system as the Fed drains liquidity, some have suggested that the regional banks face greater pressure to deposit outflows than those with more of a national presence given that deposits that get withdrawn for investment as the economy grows are less likely to find their way back to the same regional bank while the national players perhaps have a greater chance of seeing those deposits come back, can you talk about that dynamic and how you guys are thinking about the eventual kind of liquidity drain and what that means for you?","Rene F. Jones","First of all, we think about it a lot. I think that the way I would frame the model is, there's a portion of the model that hasn't changed and then there's a portion of the model that might have changed. So the portion that hasn't changed is that the way you build your deposits base is what dictates how sticky it is when rates rise. So if you were paying low rate relative to everybody else, your customers probably came to you for a different reason.","In that space, we have probably I would say, I think it's 100 up or 200 up, but we have significant runoff in our commercial space because that's just the behavior that we've seen in past cycles but it was higher on the ramp-up here so we expect it to be higher on the way down. I think we probably have higher rate scenario going up 100, maybe $6 billion of runoff which mostly comes out of the commercial space. So we're thinking about it quite a bit.","The only unknown to me is this issue of whether people are going to remain more conservative because it was so painful when they didn't have cash before, which is a positive. We're not really taking that into account but it's sort of, I think that's the other thing that's sort of on the back of our mind. So really big issue, in our numbers we assume a lot of runoff but I don't know about that theory. I think it depends on why the customer came to you over the years in the first place and if you were buying deposits, I would be more cautious than if you were very conservative in how you got them.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","My questions have been asked and answered. Thanks Rene.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Just a quick question, with all of your increase in the securities portfolio over the last couple of quarters, can you update us relative to the first quarter on sort of what net interest income impact from a 100 basis points higher rates would be, and\/or update us on the portfolio duration if that's changed materially from the first quarter?","Rene F. Jones","I don't think it's changed materially from the first quarter, I think it's about a little shy of 4.3 is the duration of the securities book, which is up from years ago obviously because of the size and the [indiscernible]. And then in up scenario we gain I think 4%, up 100. Down 100, I want to say it's like about 2.5% down, and that of course is very unlikely scenario given where we are.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Let's hope so. And then a question, you've mentioned several times how strong the C&I loan growth has been. Many of your regional bank competitors have pointed to higher utilization rates in the second quarter relative to maybe year-end. I guess I'm curious if you're seeing the same thing, and if you're seeing greater C&I borrowing for expansion rather than just sort of trade finance or other shorter-term purposes?","Rene F. Jones","I think as I sat with the folks, they are talking about usages coming \u2013 you're right on its face, a lot of our borrowing is coming from existing customers, I think with both operating needs and M&A, but there is more of an M&A transaction bend to it that more people are getting involved for that reason.","And then we keep ticking up a little, it's sort of a steady increase in the usage. So I mean we're on 52.2, actually last quarter it was 52.5. So it's actually been relatively flat, but if you look at it over the course of the year, it's up 2% to 3% over the course of 12 months. It's kind of like the C&I balances, we've seen a little bit more usage slowly every quarter, alright, a little bit more growth every quarter, very, very steady but nothing big in one given quarter.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that's helpful color. And then for my last question, at least just going back to the Hudson City transaction, it sounds from your comments that even though you have an agreement at this point through December 31 of this year, that doesn't preclude that agreement being extended if for any reason you're not able to get the BSA\/AML bedded down as rapidly as you might hope?","Rene F. Jones","I don't know that you're factually \u2013 I assume you're probably factually correct but I don't really think about it that way, I just think about putting my head down and making sure we do our part of the whole thing and then making sure that we put our best foot forward, and then if we ever get to a situation like that then we'll ask Ron and company what they'd like to do, but I'm not thinking about it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott","Rene, just to go back to that theme of deposits and deposit behaviour, a lot of folks have talked about deposit beta as in really thinking about their own deposit beta is in kind of that 50% range, 50%, 55% deposit beta range and kind of using the '04-'05 period as a baseline. Now from your commentary, it sounds like there's some offsets, I mean you were talking about that $6 billion runoff in deposits, but the uncertainty also comes from the fact that if rates rise and people and companies and corporate clients start behaving more conservatively and want to maintain deposits, maybe you see less of a runoff. So, have you talked about this, I can't remember in terms of a deposit beta and what you've kind of factored in, in terms of a deposit beta explicitly into your planning?","Rene F. Jones","I'm not going to attempt it by numbers, but I mean as I hear you say those numbers of 50%, it doesn't sound unreasonable over a long period of time, but initially it's probably less than that early on. So it's a dynamic between the first three, six months in what you're doing and how you're looking at it and where you eventually end up, and I think it's very much driven by what the customer behavior is and their elasticity around pricing. So, I think the only thing that's really different is, we assume our models make a lot of sense but the rates have been long for so long and we're coming out of that crisis that the elasticity models are untested almost, right. So this is why it's an area of focus. So a good question, a great framework to think about it. We have one but we have to kind of test the boundaries around it because it's so much uncertainty there.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay. And then you talked about the Hudson City acquisition, you've talked about it quite a lot, but you also said one of the things you need to look at is Hudson City's balance sheet and how that comes over and things you need to do as you look at their balance sheet versus yours, and what I was really trying to drill down a little bit more on was your preparation for the LCR requirements. It strikes me that clearly you're planning for the acquisition to occur, but on the other hand you have to be prepared in case it doesn't go through. So how do you think about that, do you think you have enough runway as you get closer and closer to closing on that deal that if in fact there's a last minute change that's unexpected that you are prepared to meet the LCR requirements, so how are you thinking about that, that'd just be helpful?","Rene F. Jones","So we've thought about it a lot, and the thing that's most important is, step one, everybody has tons of securities on it. So, it's all manageable within their own balance sheet, it's not an issue of bringing it together with M&T's. And so, how you deal with the leverage would change from not having the liquidity coverage ratio to having one and then the severity of the final rules, right, you've got all the flexibility built into that balance sheet already. So it just changes how you do the delevering and what you have to keep, you have to mark the portfolios to market but that's a different thing unless whether you actually have to exit and sell the security. So the answer is embedded in their own balance sheet today. That takes that uncertainty away.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay, but how about the positioning of your own securities portfolio, I mean how are you thinking about that vis-a-vis the securities you would get post acquisition? I mean it sounds like you've maintained or you're going to a liquidity portfolio so it's almost like you're trying to keep a base case where you protect yourself but the expectation is of course the deal goes through, I mean you're being conservative in that regard, is that the way to think about it or are you kind of really saying, okay, the deal is going to go through and so the securities come onboard and so that's really not something that you're that worried about, so I'm just trying to frame how you think about your own liquidity portfolio in that context?","Rene F. Jones","Your questions are great questions. The answer is, those are two separate portfolios. So M&T is doing with its balance sheet exactly what it needs to do to meet the requirement, because that balance sheet is going to be here no matter what, alright. So no thought about somebody else's balance sheet. As I begin to think about another balance sheet that we and myself and Scott and others have to manage, we look at that balance sheet separately, and what's unique about that balance sheet is it's very, very different from M&T, it's got a tremendous amount of liquidity in it. So the only question is, how much of it do you keep. You see what I'm saying?","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott","No, that makes sense, I mean you just answered my question in that you look at it separately because of that point \u2013 no, I mean it's fair, that was exactly where I was trying to get at, they do have a lot of liquidity so do you kind of assume that you're going to get that, so you don't need to manage or maintain as much, but you said that you kind of look at the two things separately. So that really answered my question. So thank you very much.","Rene F. Jones","I appreciate that. The piece that I didn't give you is that, in our assumption, we anticipated that the whole thing was going to go away. So we've got the capacity and the way we thought about it in our framework, but thanks for your question.","Operator","Your final question comes from Sachin Shah of Albert Fried.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried","So I just want to understand, there's a lot of questions about Hudson City, is there anything else aside from these issues that you guys are dealing with that you kind of envision or having or foreseeing for you to potentially close the transaction essentially delaying the completion of this work that you guys need to do?","Rene F. Jones","With respect to Hudson City, that requires a merger application, the same process that you have. So while we're focusing on the issue at hand, which is BSA\/AML, you have to have a very buttoned-down shop across the board, you have to have a good risk management structure, just the same things that you would go through with an [acquisition] (ph), so nothing unusual.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried","Okay. And just to clarify, you mentioned in earlier remark that if and when that time, if you buttoned-down the hatches, you're trying to complete this transaction, do the work, that's necessary, but for whatever reason it's getting close to the end of the year, you're going to have that conversation with Hudson City, your intention is to have that conversation with their CEO and the management team to move forward, you did mention earlier on that you still love the transaction, that is your intent if and when that scenario does come to play, is that fair?","Rene F. Jones","I've answered that. There's no more I can provide you to that question which I've been asked three, maybe four times.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried","Okay, alright, so that is the case, your intention is a question of when rather than if, how about that, it's a question of when rather than if?","Rene F. Jones","You're talking hypothetical, I'm just dealing with reality.","Sachin Shah - Albert Fried","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. MacLeod for any closing remarks.","Donald J.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to thank you all for participating in M&T's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you\u2019ve not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our Web site www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the investor relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.","Also, before we start, I\u2019d like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. As noted in this morning's earnings release, M&T's results for the fourth quarter were characterized by a continuation of the trends we've been seeing over the first three quarters of 2018. These include: further expansion of the net interest margin, growth in net interest income, growth in noninterest revenues with trust fees remaining a highlight, expenses that continue to be well-controlled in a credit environment that remains solid.","One positive aspect of the fourth quarter's results was a notable pick up in commercial and industrial lending which contributed to aggregate net loan growth for the quarter. Highlights for the full-year of 2018 include 7% growth in taxable equivalent net interest income driven by rising asset yields coming as a result of further increases in short-term interest rates initiated by the federal reserve combined with a manageable pace of deposit price increases.","Credit improved from the already strong level seen over the past three years with net charge-offs as a percentage of loans the lowest since 1987. While loan growth did not meet our expectations, that subdued growth enabled us to return the excess capital we generated back to our shareholders.","For the year, M&T repurchased $2.2 billion of common stock and paid $508 million of common dividends to our shareholders. That resulted in a 146% payout ratio for the year. The repurchase program resulted in a 5.5% decline in average diluted shares for the full-year of 2018 when compared with 2017.","Now let's look at the specifics for the fourth quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.76 for the fourth quarter of 2018, improved from $3.53 in the third quarter of 2018 and $2.01 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $546 million compared with $526 million in the linked quarter and $322 million in the year-ago quarter.","On a GAAP basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.84% and an annualized return on average common equity of 14.8%. This compares with rates of 1.8% and 14.08% respectively in the previous quarter. Included in the GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $4 million or $0.03 per common share, down slightly from the prior quarter.","Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.","M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization was $550 million compared with $531 million in the linked quarter and $327 million in 2017's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.79 in the recent quarter compared with $3.56 in the third quarter of 2018 and $2.04 in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.93% and 22.16% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.89% and 21% in the third quarter of 2018.","In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 were impacted by certain noteworthy items. Included in the fourth quarter 2018 results was a $20 million contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation. That amounted to $15 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share.","Also included in 2018's fourth quarter was a $15 million reduction in M&T's provision for income taxes, arising from an IRS approved change in tax treatment of certain loan fees which was retroactive to 2017. This also amounted to $0.11 per common share.","Included in the fourth quarter of 2017's results were $21 million of realized gains on investment securities, which amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share. Also reflected in the fourth quarter of 2017 results was the contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation of $44 million, which amounted to $27 million after-tax effect or $0.18 per common share.","M&T's effective tax rate for 2017's fourth quarter was impacted by the changes to the federal corporate income tax rates. M&T's provision for income taxes for that quarter was increased by approximately $85 million amounting to $0.56 per common share as a result of those tax law changes. As a reminder, the year-over-year comparisons for both GAAP and net operating earnings were impacted by the reduction in federal corporate income taxes for 2018.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.65 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, up $30 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin improved to 3.92%, up 4 basis points from 3.88% in the linked quarter. We estimate that the shorter -- excuse me, we estimate that higher short-term interest asset -- interest rates following the fed September and December rate actions, added a benefit to the margin of as much as 6 basis points.","Cash interest received on acquired loans combined with a slightly higher level of prepayment fees added an estimated 2 basis points to the fourth quarter margin. A higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the fed had an estimated 4 basis point dilutive effect on the margin. The higher cash balances were primarily the result of increased trust demand deposits and the continued slow pace of reinvestment of cash flows from investment securities.","Average loans increased less than 1% compared with the previous quarter. The ongoing runoff of residential real estate loans primarily acquired Hudson City mortgage loans was more than offset by growth in other loan categories, which increased $754 million or 1.1% from the third quarter.","Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were about 3% higher than in the prior quarter. This included a $275 million seasonal increase in loans to auto dealers to finance their inventories combined with a $411 million increase in other C&I loans.","Commercial real estate loans were down less than 1% compared with the third quarter with modest growth in construction loans offset by a lower level of commercial mortgage loans as a result of paydowns and a decline in loans held for sale.","Residential real estate loans which are largely comprised of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City transaction continued the expected pace of paydowns. The portfolio declined about 3% consistent with previous quarters. Consumer loans were up 2% with growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans outpacing continuing declines in home equity lines and loans.","Regionally, in addition to the multi-region seasonal rebound in floor plan lending, Pennsylvania and our Metro region, which includes New York City, Philadelphia, and Tarrytown, realized the strongest growth in C&I loans. New Jersey was the bright spot for CRE loans.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands Office and CDs over $250,000 were up about 4% annualized compared with the third quarter. The higher levels of trust demand deposits I mentioned previously were the primary driver of the increase.","Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $481 million in the fourth quarter compared with $459 million in the prior quarter. The quarter's results included $4 million of security valuation gains on our remaining portfolio of GSE preferred stock compared with the $3 million loss in the third quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues were $92 million in the recent quarter compared with $88 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $412 million in the quarter, down about 24% compared with the third quarter. A decline in origination revenues was partially offset by higher residential servicing fees attributable to a subservicing portfolio we on boarded during the third quarter.","Total residential mortgage banking revenues including both origination and servicing activities were $57 million compared with $59 million in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $35 million in the fourth quarter, up from $29 million in the linked quarter.","Trust income was $135 million in the recent quarter, up slightly from $134 million in the previous quarter and up 4% from $130 million in 2017's fourth quarter. New business generation continues to be strong, while the weakness in equity markets during the quarter was a modest headwind. Service charges on deposit accounts were $109 million essentially unchanged from the prior quarter.","Trading and FX gains were $17 million, improved by $11 million from the prior quarter largely reflecting customer interest rate swap activity coming as a result of the improved pace of commercial lending.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were $797 million. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter's operating expenses reflected a $20 million contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation. Excluding the contribution, operating expenses increased by $7 million from $770 million in 2018's third quarter. That increase reflects higher salaries and benefits attributable to one additional working day during the quarter and increased incentive compensation expense arising from last year's solid financial performance.","The remaining expense categories in aggregate were essentially flat with the prior quarter with the elimination of the FDIC's large bank surcharge being partially offset by higher other cost of operations.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator of which does include the charitable contribution was 51.7% in the recent quarter, increased slightly from 51.4% in the previous quarter. The ratio was 54.7% in 2017's fourth quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality continues to be largely in line with the trend seen over the past few quarters, indeed, consistent with the trend seen over the past few years. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 17 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 7 basis points in the third quarter. Recall that the third quarter's results included a sizable $13 million recovery on a previously charged-off CRE loan.","The provision for credit losses was $38 million in the recent quarter, essentially matching net charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses was $1 billion at the end of December and the ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.15% at the end of 2018.","Nonaccrual loans increased by $23 million at December 31 compared with the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans increased by 1 basis point ending the quarter at 1.01%. We did see a rise in criticized loans during the quarter, primarily driven by a couple of large loans with unique circumstances.","Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that have been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were $223 million at the end of the quarter. Of these loans, $192 million or 86% are guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.13% compared with 10.46% at the end of the third quarter. The decline reflects retention -- the decline reflects earnings retention during the fourth quarter, share repurchases and the impact of the improved loan growth, which in turn led to higher end of period risk-weighted assets. M&T repurchased $500 million of its common stock during the quarter.","As noted earlier, for the full-year of 2018, M&T repurchased 12.3 million shares of its common stock valued at $2.2 billion and paid $508 million of common dividends to our shareholders. This resulted in a 146% payout ratio for the year.","Next I\u2019d like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2018's full-year results. GAAP based diluted earnings per common share were $12.74, up 46% from $8.70 in 2017. Net income was $1.92 billion improved from $1.41 billion in the prior year. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.64% and 12.82%, respectively.","Net operating income, which excludes intangible amortization was $1.94 billion improved from $1.43 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating income per common share was $12.86, also up 46% from $8.82 in 2017.","Net operating income for 2018 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.72% and 19.09%, respectively. We note that the full-year improvement in GAAP and net operating earnings included a sizable benefit from lower U.S corporate tax rates. However, the year-over-year improvement notwithstanding lower taxes was significant. Pre-tax GAAP and net operating income both improved by 8%, while diluted common shares outstanding declined by 5.5% as a result of the repurchase activity.","Now turning to the outlook. Looking forward into 2019, our outlook is fairly consistent with the one we shared on this call last January. While GDP growth may slow from the pace seen in 2018, we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen in the last -- seen since the last recession ended.","Unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers financial positions are healthy. Consumer confidence remains relatively high, although commercial customers are slightly more cautious. In addition, there continues to be measurable progress toward a regulatory approach tailored for banks like M&T.","However, with the usual caveat that events never unfold entirely in the manner you expect, here are a few thoughts for the upcoming year. Loans outstanding declined on a full-year average basis in 2018, but were up at the end of 2018 by about one half of 1% from the end of 2017. This reflected a 13% decline in residential mortgage loans offset by 4% aggregate growth in the other loan portfolios.","Average total loans for the fourth quarter of 2018 were down about one half of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017 average with a 13% decline in residential real estate loans offset by aggregate 3% growth in the other portfolios. While as noted, commercial and industrial loan growth in the past quarter was notably stronger than any quarter over the past two years. Paydowns continue to be a wildcard.","Our pipeline as we enter 2018 -- 2019 is consistent with or perhaps slightly better than it was at this point last year. The CRE market remains somewhat active, most notably in the multifamily and healthcare sectors. As was the case in 2018, CRE loan growth for the coming year will be dictated by the rate at which existing construction projects are funded, demand for new construction financing, as well as for permanent financing and construction project -- as construction projects reach completion.","We expect continued runoff of the residential real estate portfolio likely at a consistent low double-digit pace. Although the dollar amount of the decline will continue to lessen as that portfolio gets smaller. And we continue to see attractive pricing in underwriting standards in the consumer area.","Given these trends, our expectation for 2019 is that average total loans will grow on a full-year basis at a low single-digit pace. If the improved pace of C&I lending that M&T experienced in the fourth quarter continues, including slower paydowns, we could exceed that rate.","As has been the case, since the Fed began to raise interest rates in late 2015, our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on for the rate actions. A flat scenario should still lead to some expansion of the margin from 3.92% in the fourth quarter as the benefit from last year September and December Fed actions extended over a full calendar year. Any future rate actions by the Fed in 2019 should they occur, will potentially offer further moderate upside.","Deposit pricing reactivity remains an area of focus and appears likely to be somewhat higher than in the past. As the Fed slows or halts its pace of short-term rate increases, there is a likelihood the deposit pricing pressures will continue for a period of time. That outlook excludes the potential impact from cash balances brought in through Wilmington Trust, which usually have an impact on the reported margin, but would have a lesser incremental effect on revenue.","The level of cash on deposit at the Fed was higher at year-end than the average for the fourth quarter. Based on the current level of interest rates and reflecting the impact of the interest rate hedges we entered into last year, our estimate for a hypothetical future 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates will bring a more modest benefit to the net interest margin that we\u2019ve seen previously, perhaps in the area of 2 to 4 basis points. This embeds a series of assumptions on result on deposit pricing reactivity.","Based on those balance in margin assumptions, we expect year-over-year growth in net interest income. The higher interest rate environment will likely continue to challenge residential mortgage banking in 2018, specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations.","As we've noted previously, we have the capacity and appetite for additional owned MSR servicing or subservicing business. This could offer a potential offset to slower originations. The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in 2018 with growth in the low single-digit range with the exception of trust revenues, which have been growing in a mid single-digit or better pace.","Excluding the $135 million addition to the litigation reserve from full-year 2018's operating expenses, we expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses for 2019 over last year. As is our usual practice, we budget for modest positive operating leverage based on our revenue outlook. This includes the full-year benefit approximately $40 million from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge.","We would remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in the first quarter of 2019, which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items. Last year that increase was approximately $56 million.","In each of the first quarter's of 2017 and 2018, we realized the benefit to our provision for income taxes when prior year equity grants vested at stock prices higher than the price at the grant date. At current levels, unless there's a meaningful rally in our stock price, we wouldn't expect a similar benefit in 2019's first quarter.","Our outlook for credit remains balanced. We just completed our 5th consecutive year of net charge-off experience below 20 basis points. For each of the past four years, we\u2019ve cautioned that the trend can't continue and that losses will tick upward, although not approaching long-term averages. I'll reiterate that outlook this year. Eventually I will get this right. There continue to be some modest pressures on nonperforming and criticized loans, but there are no apparent weaknesses in particular industries or geographies.","Regarding taxes, our outlook for the effective tax rate for 2018 in the range of 25% to 26% proved to be conservative. An approximate rate of 25% is more appropriate for 2019, unless some discrete items occur during the coming year. As to capital, while the Fed implements its amended capital and stress testing rules for banks of our size, we will continue to execute our 2018 capital plan through the end of this year's second quarter.","We expect final rules from the Fed in time for our 2019 capital plan. We expect to continue to manage our capital levels towards the lower end of our peer group as we believe our consistent approach to underwriting credit and the resultant low earnings volatility argues for maintaining our capital levels towards the lower end of that range maintained by our peers.","Of course as you\u2019re aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open the call to questions, before which Laurie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","I guess, maybe just starting off in terms of the very strong growth that we saw in C&I lending this quarter. Presumably some of the -- some of that seasonal like the auto dealer piece that you mentioned, but when you think about like going into 2019 or even where we stand today, is the environment changing? Is the dialogue with borrowers getting meaningfully better or is there something particularly unusual with this quarter that may slow in future quarters? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So there was normal seasonal uptick in our auto floor plan balances, which we had talked about on the third quarter call, that also benefited from a couple of large relationships that we on boarded during the quarter. So we would expect that number to stay around where it is at least for the first two quarters of the year. When we look outside of floor plan and we look at other C&I lending, we typically see a little bit more activity in the fourth quarter than we do in the other quarters, because year-end tends to drive things to completion. But when we look across industries and we look across geographies, it was broad-based, the uptick, which for us was encouraging and that it wasn't one sector or one geography driving the growth. And so I think there's -- I would say there's comfort from our customers perspective in the economy, but still a little bit of trepidation. And we\u2019re hopeful that the dialogue that we saw in the fourth quarter continues into the first and second and through the year, but I guess remains to be seen, it's tough to draw conclusions off of just one quarter. And as we look underneath, we continue to see solid activity as it regards to payoffs and paydowns. And so it was really new originations that drove a lot of the growth in the quarter. And as we enter 2019 the pipelines are reasonably consistent, maybe even slightly above where they were last year. So, we're guardedly optimistic about the C&I in 2019.","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. And then just my other question I had, in terms of the trust demand deposits, obviously is non-interest-bearing grew quite a bit this quarter, which is great. How sustainable are those or what's the typical pattern, if there is a typical pattern for those? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So you\u2019re right. Trust demand deposits were up sizably in the fourth quarter. We often see a little seasonality in those balances as well towards the end of the year. At least we\u2019ve seen -- we saw that I think two years ago. Many of those will leave the balance sheet in the first quarter. Those tend to fluctuate depending on market activity that's going on. So we expect those will be down closer to the levels that we saw in the third and second quarters of 2018 as we enter the first half of 2019.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","On the -- back to the loan growth, regarding the fourth quarter trends, how much of a impact did you see in the quarter on the commercial side from the capital markets drying up a bit in December? And then separately, just trying to think about how to model out that commercial growth, would you say that 6% end of period year-over-year growth that you saw in commercial is something that could tail off a little bit from that? And is that baked into your guidance or could it be back towards the low single-digit range? Thanks.","Darren King","So when we look at C&I in the fourth quarter, I guess starting with the question about the capital markets, we did see a little bit of freeze up in some of the capital markets activity. But it didn't seem to affect our payoffs and paydowns levels in the fourth quarter. So my take on that is that many of the funds that are supplying credit that are nonbanks still had money and they were still lending and that any of the activity that was going on would have been new money that would have gone into the funds that isn't yet spoken for, except at the larger end of the customer range which is typically above where we would compete. When we look at the growth in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there always is a little bit of extra activity that seems to happen in the fourth quarter. So 6% to me feels really high and we're not anticipating that rate of growth would continue in 2019. We expect that to come down, we also expect to see some balances come off the balance sheet in the first half of the year. And so we're a little bit more moderated on our outlook for commercial balance growth in the year, closer to kind of the low single-digit growth that we've been talking about all the way along.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, separately on the operating leverage side, I know you indicated that you still expect operating leverage for 2019. We saw, I guess on what we view is a core basis, maybe 350 to 400 basis points positive operating leverage for 2018. What type of -- what magnitude of leverage do you think we could see as you look at 2019?","Darren King","So when we talk about operating leverage, I guess it's important to make sure that we're all on the same page and what we're talking about and seeing. So when we talk about modest positive operating leverage, we exclude from the year-over-year calculations the $135 million that we added to the litigation reserve in 2018's first quarter. If you're looking on a GAAP basis then expenses will be down, but when you factor that out which we do, then we expect some modest expense growth even factoring in the FDIC, but we expect revenue growth to be slightly above that. And so we will expect some modest operating leverage obviously depending on rates that could be hot more or less, but based on as we look forward right now we think it's slightly positive.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to start on the NIM. So it's pretty fair you guys will benefit in the first quarter from the December hike, but given your comments for December deposit pressures to persist, the Fed does go on hold, how do you think NIM progresses for the rest of the year?","Darren King","So as we look forward right now, we think the first quarter NIM gets a little bit of benefit as we mentioned before from the full impact of the hike in December. And then you got to remember, I guess, there's a couple of things. We expect some of the cash balances to come down, so those impact the margin and will impact it positively as well as the day count in the first quarter also help the margin. So with those three factors, we're expecting an increase in the margin in the first quarter. From there when we look forward with no further actions by the Fed, we would expect to kind of be within a couple of basis points plus or minus of where we are in the first quarter through the rest of the year. And then, the question is obviously how the market reacts from a deposit pricing perspective in absence of any Fed increases. Typically deposit pricing continues for little bit after the Fed stops and so we're anticipating some of that. The caveat which I think is a little bit different is for many banks. They\u2019ve got excess securities balances that we can look to, given the change in LCR that we anticipate from the new regulations and always the question is how loan growth behaves. And if it continues like the fourth quarter for everyone and probably be a little more deposit pricing pressure if it comes back to where we've seen in the first three quarters of the year then there is probably a little bit less pressure. So I know that gives you lots of things to think about and lot of things that are on our minds. So it's not exactly a straightforward question.","Steven Alexopoulos","That certainly helps. And then regarding the strong growth in C&I, quite a few other banks are pointing to customers using their cash balances right to fund expansion too. Can you give us a sense if we put the impact from the trust related deposits aside, like what did you see in noninterest bearing deposits this quarter? Thanks.","Darren King","Yes. So if you hold trust demand inside, our non-interest-bearing for the quarter was flat to maybe slightly down. And if you look underneath, there's some seasonality in non-interest-bearing balances that we see at M&T because of the commercial, the magnitude of the commercial noninterest-bearing that we hold and typically the commercial customers will hold deposits through the end of the year into January in anticipation of making distributions to their principles and paying taxes. So we also typically see a little bit of an outflow of noninterest bearing in the first quarter in the commercial side for those reasons and then they slowly grow over the course of the year. So, outside of trust, we are actually encouraged by the non-interest-bearing that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. But are you also seeing customers use noninterest bearing deposits of fund expansion?","Darren King","Yes, we're seeing some of that. We're also seeing them use their lines as a way to fund growth as well. I guess my take on it is the behavior. They got the line and rates are still relatively low. So they will fund something on the line and then make a decision about making it into more permanent term debt or using their cash to eliminate it. And so we\u2019ve seen a little bit, but not a ton of use of the cash to invest. We've seen more if we see cash flowing out of accounts, it tends to be going from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing accounts either on balance sheet or off.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Wellesley of Loomis Sayles.","Julian Wellesley","I have a question about middle-market lending competition. In the past you talked about frothiness in this area in terms of spreads or terms and conditions. How are you seeing things now?","Darren King","I don't think we've seen a material decrease in the competitiveness of the lending environment. I think we saw as an industry in the fourth quarter a couple of things. I think we saw a lot of activity that was pent up, that was trying to get done by the end of the year as well as maybe a slight pause in the nonbank markets, but as I mentioned before, we didn\u2019t see a material slowdown in payoffs and paydowns. Pricing has been dropping. When we look at our pricing and spreads for the last couple of quarters, they seemed to have leveled off. So our take on that is that it was the impact of the tax reform, kind of working its way through pricing and it seems to have stabilized. And really when we see changes we were seeing, we continue to see covenant light things up there. If we see things on structure, we are seeing longer interest-only periods and maybe slight moves up in LTVs, but it was minor. So from our perspective the fourth quarter, it didn't get worse, but it didn\u2019t really get better.","Julian Wellesley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask, Darren, a little bit more about the flexibility on the securities portfolio if you didn't have to adhere to LCR. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what the potential yield benefit would be or would you shrink your balance sheet and that would still be spread accretive?","Darren King","So within the securities portfolio, I think if you look at what our securities portfolio is today, it's still higher than where we were before liquidity coverage ratio became a requirement. And so, we will never take that down to zero because we do want that liquidity, but there's an option to look at that as one source to fund loan growth. And given the spreads here on securities versus the spreads on loans, shifting that mix would be a positive for our margin. If you look at what we've been doing with that book over the last few quarters as longer dated mortgage-backed securities of paydown, we've held that money in cash or invested in short-term treasuries just given where the rate environment has been. But we look -- we don\u2019t have a specific plan for that portfolio this year per se, but we consider it amongst our options versus overnight funding versus brokered deposits versus bank debt and obviously customer deposit growth as an avenue to fund loan growth. And we're always thinking about the impact on the duration of the balance sheet as well as the cost of funds as we consider all those options.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, as we think about the revenue outlook for 2019, if somehow it falls a little short of your budget, is there flex in your expense outlook or expense budget to be able to create positive operating leverage even if the revenue outlook is a little bit softer than what we're expecting today?","Darren King","Sure. Great question. I think the positive operating leverage comment, there's a number of things that could impact that. The biggest one is what happens with rates with the Fed and if they turn from raising to decline. If rates stay flat then we should be okay on positive operating leverage. But to answer your question, there is some flex in our expenses. It doesn't happen -- it doesn't turn on a dime, but over the course of a couple of quarters there are things that we have an ability to do to manage the pace of the expense growth. But we\u2019re going to balance that off against the investments that we're making for the long-term of the bank. And if we have to sacrifice a little bit of operating leverage in the short-term to make the investments we need to for the bank for the future, we\u2019re not going to worry about that too much.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one last question on the deposit repricing delay. How many quarters typically does it take after the last fed rate hike in terms of the repricing for the repricing to cease or significantly die down?","Darren King","If you use the past as an indication of the future, it's usually two to three quarters that can continue, but it also depends on what the reactivity has been up to that point. And so there's a lot of things that go into that and then the other question of course is how much loan demand is there and need for those funds. So that's kind of what we've seen in the past. I think there's reason to believe that there are couple of differences, one positive and one negative to that history in the current environment. But that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush.","Peter Winter","Good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","I wanted to ask about credit quality. Obviously, it's very strong, but you\u2019ve got nonperforming assets that increased a little bit two quarters in a row, you mentioned the criticized loans increasing. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just give a little bit color there? And then, secondly, with the outlook for better loan growth next year or 2019, would you expect to start adding to reserves?","Darren King","Sure. So, I guess I started at the high-level and look at delinquency and where delinquency trends have been. We haven't seen anything that that gives us cause for concern in any of the books. We've seen a little bit of an increase as you noted in year-end in nonperformers and the allowance. Actually the allowance is pretty flat in nonperformers. And when we look under the covers of what's going on there, we continue to not really see any particular industry as it relates to C&I, any particular class of real estate as it relates to CRE, any particular geography from a consumer perspective that causes us concern. Now that said, where M&T and we\u2019re paranoid. So we\u2019re going back through the book again, to see if there's anything that we're missing. But generally as we\u2019ve gone through the nonperformers, there are also couple of larger nonperformers in couple of larger criticize that we -- that I mentioned before, they\u2019re very specific situations. So we\u2019re comfortable with where things are, but we're M&T, so we are paranoid.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just the -- possibly adding to reserves with a better outlook for loan growth this year?","Darren King","Yes, I mean, obviously we go through our allowance every quarter. And we've got a process that we follow every quarter looking at the grades of our loans and the charge-off rates and obviously we\u2019ve a little higher loan growth that would be reasonable to expect that the provision would go up with it.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thanks, Darren.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Jeffrey Elliott","Hello. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on those criticized loans. Can you give us a bit more of a sense of the magnitude of the increase, just to give us a feel for how significant or not significant it is? And then, anything on the industry or types of loans, any kind of color around those that will be helpful? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. It's going to be a couple of hundred million dollar increase in the quarter compared to third quarter. And within there, there's two or three large loans over $50 million that we've got our eye on. And it's a variety of industry and various different reasons why. In one case, we've got a company that has a debt service coverage ratio that got a little close to our trigger, but when we look at that company and we look through its income statement and we work with them, we can see that they\u2019ve opportunities to change their expense profile and rectify that situation. When we look at another one, we see some excessive leverage that was helped by some of the non-bank financials. So, there's a story to each one and there are paths for them to not remain on that criticized list, but because we're doing our work and we\u2019re watching what's going on, we put them on that list to make sure that we pay attention to it and try to keep them from becoming defaults.","Jeffrey Elliott","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning.","Frank Schiraldi","Just one question. Just on the -- this might be splitting hairs, Darren, but just in terms of the December rate hike that we already got, you talked about 2 to 4 basis points of benefit and if we get any additional rate hikes perhaps in 2019. And in the past you guys talked about 5 to 8 bps I think of benefit. So just wondering if December rate hike the benefit you\u2019re likely to get in the first quarter from it, is that somewhere in between or is the 2 to 4 bps a good number to use there?","Darren King","That\u2019s not a bad number to use, because we\u2019ve gotten some benefit of it already, right, and we\u2019ve talked about 5 to 8 before. So that\u2019s probably a good number to use.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, Darren. How are you?","Darren King","Good. How are you, Gerard?","Gerard Cassidy","Good. Thank you. On your C&I loan growth that you saw this quarter, when you look at it, what percentage of it came from existing customers versus new customers that you won in the quarter?","Darren King","It's a great question. If you look at our loan book, we generally get the majority of our loan growth from our existing customers just because on a percentage basis of the portfolio that's where a lot of the growth comes from. We did see some new customer adds, particularly in New Jersey. We noted New Jersey as a strong growth market. I will remind everyone once again that it continues to be basically a de novo, so it's of a small base, but it was a really nice add in terms of what we refer to as prospect convergence in the quarter. But when you look in aggregate, the bulk tends to come from the existing customer base.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then speaking of New Jersey, I think you said in your opening remarks you saw some good commercial real estate loan growth in New Jersey. Was that construction or mortgage -- commercial real estate term mortgage? And just what types of properties were you able to finance?","Darren King","So I don't have the specifics for New Jersey on those ones, Gerard, but the trend we saw in the quarter have seen for much of the year is activity in multifamily and in hotel space. So I would expect that in New Jersey we saw some of that, but just given our presence in New Jersey and the fact that we are growing out, I think it's a little bit broader that we would see some permanent mortgage business there as well.","Gerard Cassidy","And then lastly, obviously M&T has always distinguish itself on your ability to manage your capital, very effectively, granted the post financial crisis has changed that a bit. But once you come out of CCAR, what are the advantages that you guys are thinking you are going to have in terms of managing your capital, once you don\u2019t have to go through the annual CCAR test?","Darren King","So we\u2019re still waiting for final word on what all of this is going to mean, both in terms of what the process is with the regulators as well as whether the new stress capital buffer framework comes into effect. I guess, what -- we\u2019re hopeful for is that we start to end up in a place a little bit like the LCR or where the LCR seems to be evolving and that its part of your normal supervisory process that you\u2019re reviewing your position with the regulators, but you have a little bit more flexibility to manage that part of the balance sheet without some of the specifics of what you can do and how much you can do in any given time period. And I think we just look for the ability to be able to deploy our shareholders capital either into customer growth, if they need support and we want to be there to provide lending to help them grow their businesses. And when they're not able to do that, we want to be able to take that capital that we can't put to use in the business and return to the shareholders and kind of not have as many restrictions on how much we can return in any quarter that we can be a little bit more dynamic in how we manage the balance sheet.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Hi. Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","Just wonder if you could talk about how other bank CEOs are thinking about the stocks, the environment. Obviously, you have a lot of capital you\u2019ve been acquired in the past, just wondering if a selloff in stocks and [indiscernible] assets in general and increased macro concerns maybe bring up some people to the table or think a little bit differently than say 3, 6 months ago?","Darren King","So, I guess I haven't spent a lot of time with other bank CEOs to know exactly what they\u2019re thinking. But when you look at the market and what\u2019s happened with bank stocks and with multiples, the whole industry is rerated down basically together. I think, we had a better December than some others did, but we\u2019re still all relatively down. So for someone to think about selling or for acquisition that to work its about the difference between the buyer and the seller in some cases and the relative differences hasn't changed from what it was a few months ago. And I don't think we've heard too much where people are capitulating and thinking that the world is coming to an end and it's time to sell my bank.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Spahr","Hi. Thank you. The treating line item, a pretty good pickup quarter actually compared to actually the last few years on a quarterly basis and you attributed to a pickup in C&I lending. Given your commentary on C&I lending going forward or just loan growth going forward, do you think that trading is a lot sustainable or will you kind of revert back to what we\u2019ve seen in the last few years in trading?","Darren King","Yes, the trading tends to go and locks that with originations. And it's not just C&I lending originations that happened to have a big impact on the balance sheet this quarter, but originations continued in the quarter in both CRE and C&I, and both of those sectors will use swaps to manage their interest rate risk. And so the trading account should move in lockstep with loan origination activity, and so that moves up or down the trading revenue should move up or down as well.","Christopher Spahr","And just as a follow-up, the other commentary on fee revenues excluding kind of the trust, if that takes into account kind of that -- kind of outlook, correct?","Darren King","Yes.","Christopher Spahr","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","So I wanted to kind of follow-up on maybe you had a discussion earlier about some of the LCR and sort of thoughts going forward and managing your liquidity. I guess, looking at page 14 in your press release and the year-over-year '18 versus '17, the securities portfolio has come down quite a bit since 2017?","Darren King","Yes.","Brian Klock","And just thinking about it now and on an end of period basis at the end of the year, it's even below the fourth quarter average of $13 billion. So, I know you\u2019ve had deposit runoff to some Hudson City time deposits etcetera. I guess, how do you think about that level of the securities portfolio in 2018? Do you think this is -- I guess, you got to use this just with other hedging and other telco strategies, but is this an area where this will grow from here or this where do you think it might stabilize at on the security side?","Darren King","Sure. So on that page, Brian, when we look at securities and the portfolio, we look at it in combination with the top line there, interest-bearing deposits at banks or cash asset [ph]. And when we have been seeing payoffs and paydowns of the securities portfolio, depending on where rates were, we've been holding some of that in cash because the rate were getting in cash is within 10 or 15 basis points of what you could get at one year treasuries. And within our securities portfolio, it's kind of had a bit of a barbell, if you will, between at mortgage-backed securities being kind of longer dated for rate and then the shorter end to manage duration. And so we've been just allowing some of the securities portfolio to go into cash and that's why you see some of those cash balances increasing. Some of it was absolutely because of growth in trust demand, but some of it is also just shifting between securities and cash. And so, if you look at the combined, they are down a little bit, but it's not as quite as dramatic as what the securities might look like on its own.","Brian Klock","Got it. So if I think about average earning assets in '19 versus '18, so that anything outside of loans whether it's the interest-bearing deposit Fed fund security, that\u2019s going to be around maybe $19 billion on average which has seems like it's been in the last two years. So the earning asset growth could be higher than whatever you put into loan growth will grow your earning assets from the 106.8 that you had for 2018.","Darren King","Maybe, maybe not. So you could see switch between categories, right. You could see just within the loan book switch between mortgage versus the other categories because of that continued run down and then within the asset -- on the asset side of the balance sheet between securities and loan. So aggregate earning asset growth would -- might be flat to slightly down, depending on how we choose to fund some of the loan growth.","Brian Klock","Okay. And just a real follow -- quick follow-up question on the fee income guidance. So when you talked about the trust being mid single-digit, because there's a good momentum in that business. So would the mortgage banking be included with all the other in that low single-digit guide or is mortgage banking expected to be a little softer because some of the headwinds on originations?","Darren King","It's included with everything else.","Brian Klock","Okay. Thanks for your time, Darren.","Darren King","Sure, Brian.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. This is Don MacLeod. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Rene F. Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As I noted in the press release, we got off to a bit of a slow start in 2014 with lower-than-normal levels of client activity in January and February, followed by a rebound in March. This was the case for both the balance sheet, as well as some of the fee income categories. Nonetheless, the quarter was a productive one. We received a non-objection to our capital plan from the Federal Reserve, access to debt markets and financed one of our trough issues with perpetual preferred stock, plus eliminating the need for additional amounts of preferred for the foreseeable future. And we continue to make progress on our BSA\/AML compliance, risk management and capital planning and stress-testing capabilities.","I'll have further thoughts on some of these topics later in the call, but first, let me review a few of the highlights from our first quarter results, after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions.","Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.61 for the first quarter, compared with $1.56 in last year's fourth quarter and $1.98 in the first quarter of 2013.","Net income for the recent period was $229 million, compared with $221 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $274 million in the year-ago quarter.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.","After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $6 million or $0.05 per common share in both the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013.","M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $235 million, up from $228 million in the linked quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.66 for the recent quarter, up from $1.61 in the linked quarter.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.15% and 12.76% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.11% and 12.67% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $662 million for the first quarter of 2014, down by $10 million from the linked quarter. The decline was attributable to 90 days in the quarter compared with 92 days in the prior quarter. The net interest margin was 3.52% during the quarter, down by 4 basis points compared with 3.56% in the fourth quarter.","Although the reduced day count in the quarter had the effect of reducing net interest income, it added 2 basis points to the reported margins.","We'd estimate that the actions taken during the quarter to further build our liquidity asset buffer in connection with the liquidity coverage ratio reduced the reported net interest margin by about 4 basis points.","During the quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of senior banknotes and began to deploy the proceeds of that issuance into LCR qualifying investments. Finally, the remaining 2 basis points of margin compression represents our estimated core margin pressure, which includes the impact of new loans coming on at rates lower than those maturing and which is partially offset by a lower cost of funds.","The average interest-earning assets increased by $1.2 billion or 7% annualized as compared with the prior quarter. The increase included an $911 million increase in the average investment securities, as well as the $213 million or 1% annualized increase in average loans.","Average commercial and industrial loans or those loans to support business operations grew at a healthy 9% annualized rate. We saw strong double-digit growth in both Pennsylvania and in our New York City Metropolitan region, as well as continued growth in auto floor plan loans.","Average commercial real estate loans declined slightly at an annualized rate of 1%. While the origination activity remained steady, we experienced the higher level of paydowns, a high proportion of which were refinanced by CMBS conduits or life insurance companies at lower rates or longer terms.","The industry-wide slowdown in the residential mortgage loan volumes has resulted in a smaller portfolio of loans being held in the pipeline for eventual sale and that was the primary factor driving an annualized 7% decline in residential real estate loans.","Average consumer loans grew at an annualized rate of 3%, with strong growth in indirect auto loans being partially offset by continued declines in home equity lines of credit, as well as seasonal softness in recreation finance lending.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, grew at an annualized rate of 2% from the fourth quarter. On an end-of-period basis, core deposits grew at a much stronger annualized rate of 11%.","Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $420 million in the first quarter compared with $446 million in the prior quarter. There were no securities gains or losses in either period.","Mortgage banking revenues were $80 million in the recent quarter, down $2 million from the prior quarter. Commercial gain on sale revenues declined by $6 million compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting lower volumes of commercial mortgage loans originated for sale. The impact from those was partially offset by higher residential mortgage servicing revenues.","Fee income from deposit services provided were $104 million during the first quarter compared with $110 million in the linked quarter, primarily due to lower levels of NSF volumes, as well as lower customer debit card activity.","Trust and investment revenues were $121 million compared with $126 million in the prior quarter. Some portion of this decline is seasonal and we would expect to see a rebound in the coming quarters in addition to the seasonally strong tax-preparation fees we typically realize in the second quarter.","Turning to expenses. We continue to make investments in our risk management and compliance framework. As a result, our operating expenses are still elevated from what we think of as our normal ongoing expense level.","Operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude expense from the amortization of intangible assets, were $692 million, down by $41 million from $733 million in the prior quarter. Recall that the fourth quarter's results included a $40 million addition to our litigation reserve.","In the first quarter, salaries and benefits increased by $35 million, reflecting in part the normal seasonal increase that comes from the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, higher FICA expense, higher unemployment insurance expense and expenses related to the 401(k) match. As in prior years, as these items return to more normal levels, we would expect the comparable decline in this year's second quarter.","The other noteworthy change from the linked quarter was a $34 million decline in professional services expense. As we noted on the January call, those expenses likely peaked in the fourth quarter, reflecting the front-end spending tied to our BSA\/AML, capital planning and stress testing and other initiatives. Bob Wilmers offered additional details on our risk management and other investment priorities in his message to shareholders published with the 2013 Annual Report.","That said, we would expect our spending in these categories to remain elevated, possibly through the third quarter, before beginning to show improvement.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities, gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was 63.9% for the first quarter compared with 65.5% in the prior quarter.","Next, let's spend some time on credit. Our credit quality remains strong and in line with our expectations. Non-accrual loans increased slightly from the end of the fourth quarter. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans increased by 3 basis points to 1.39% as of the end of the first quarter. Notwithstanding that slight increase, when we file our 10-Q in the coming weeks, I would expect that we'll report another decline in classified loans.","Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $32 million, down from $42 million in the fourth quarter and annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 20 basis points for the first quarter, improved slightly from 26 basis points in the fourth quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $32 million in the first quarter. The allowance for credit losses was $917 million, amounting to 1.43% of total loans at the end of March. The allowance for -- the loan loss allowance as of March 31, 2014 was 7.1x annualized net charge-offs.","Loans 90 days past due on which we accrue -- continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that have been marked a fair value at acquisition, were $307 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $291 million or 95% are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Accruing loans 90 days past due were $369 million at the end of the fourth quarter, of which 81% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 9.45% at the end of March, up 23 basis points from 9.22% at the end of 2013. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under the recently adopted Basel III capital rules is approximately 9.22%. And tangible book value per share increased by 3% from the prior quarter to $53.92 per share.","We were very pleased to have received the non-objection from the Federal Reserve's CCAR stress test on both the quantitative and qualitative basis.","As we noted last month, our capital plan for the coming 12 months includes maintaining our common dividend at its $2.80 a share annual rate, as well as continued payments of dividends and interest on other regulatory capital instruments.","Turning to our outlook. As I mentioned at the outset, client activity was very slow across the board for both the balance sheet and some of the fee categories in January and February and then picked up significantly in March. Our sense is that the slowdown was likely a temporary issue.","Regarding loan growth, we were pleased with the momentum we had in C&I lending. We expect continued pressure on pricing and structures in the CRE space. At this point in time, we're maintaining our outlook for mid-single digit loan growth through -- in 2014.","We continue to expect modest ongoing core compression and a net interest margin of about 2 basis points per quarter. As we've discussed, we will see a continued decline in the printed margin as we take further steps towards reaching full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio by the end of this year. However, those actions will have little to no impact, no negative impact on net interest income.","We expect some improvement in fee-based revenue going into the second quarter despite the slow start. Our outlook for fee revenue growth in 2014 remains in the mid-single digit area. And as noted earlier, expenses will be elevated as our pace of investment will remain high over the next couple of quarters before we begin to see some improvement. Our goal is to be well-positioned for 2015.","The outlook for credit is stable. There are no signs of any turn in asset quality metrics. With respect to our work on BSA\/AML compliance, we continue to make considerable progress, achieving several important milestones by the end of this first quarter. However, we have much more work to do and we're working closely with the Federal Reserve to implement a strong and sustainable BSA program.","I would also note that despite passing the CCAR stress test this year, we're also focused on continued improvement in our capital planning and stress-testing capabilities in anticipation of CCAR 2015.","Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Lori will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So I'm not sure, maybe you can kind of let us know on the expense side, things came in better than I was expecting, I think better than the Street was expecting. And you talked about achieving many significant BSA-related milestones. So, I mean, is there a way you can kind of gauge for us or say, is there a -- are you through the fourth inning or fifth inning? Or maybe kind of let us know, I guess, how much progress or how far along the way you guys are with the BSA\/AML process?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. As I said a few minutes ago, I think we've made very significant progress. We do have a lot of steps left to do. And so to give you to sort of some sense, what we're really attempting to do and we've been doing since the last year is we're trying to do a complete overhaul of our program. What we've done most recently is we've implemented -- we've launched the new enterprise-wide know-your-customer program. And if you think of that, what we're doing, what that involves is having -- putting in place your process to identify all the customers' accounts and to collect a more comprehensive view of all the information at account opening and then to begin to use that to go through a new, enhanced rescoring process. And so one of the steps that we've made a progress on to date is we -- as of March 31, all new customers are going through that process and it's a much, much enhanced process. And obviously, if you just take that one step, we'll need time for -- to see that work and to make sure it's working properly and for all of the regulatory parties to get comfortable with that, but that's an example of one of the things we've done. We still have got a lot more work to do. We've got work to do on transaction monitoring. We've got work to do to take a look at our overall policies and procedures. But we're making really significant progress. As a -- by way of example, in all of our new procedures, we've trained over 7,800 employees on the new program in those procedures. We've increased our staffing. We are now, at the end of the quarter, up to 425 individuals, FTEs working in the BSA\/AML compliance area. And then one of the biggest things that we've got to do is that once we get comfortable with our new process and how it's working, including the risk scoring, we've got to go take a look back at our customer base, our existing customer base, and sort of understand whether our new process would have come out with any different answer and whether there's anything in that book that we would uncover now that we have a new enhanced process. So it's a lot of work. We're really pleased that we made the progress we've had to date, but we still have a fair bit of work to do. And so we ask you to kind of stick with us. We'll keep updating you.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That's a -- I appreciate the color. And I guess, maybe thinking just one other question on the expense and then I'll get back in the queue. You did talk about the highly compensated seasonal spike that you have. The professional services were down $34 million, linked quarter. But remind be, isn't there usually in the second quarter that the other miscellaneous expenses usually have sort of a -- sort of catch-up after the sort of lower first quarter? Should we expect that same sort of ramp that we've seen in the last second to first quarter changes in that other expense line?","Rene F. Jones","I'm not sure -- well, one, if you look back, pick a period 5, 6 years, yes, you do see the decline in salaries and benefits and you should see a slight uptick in the -- in those categories. I'm not so sure whether that would be the case of not, Brian. I don't -- I haven't thought about it that much, but that would be typical, if that helps.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just with that, can you actually -- can you give us the actual amount of the stock-based compensation expense here in the first quarter and the FICA food and insurance expense items?","Rene F. Jones","How do I say this? The best I can do is, because what you have is we've also got other things that are in there, as well as sort of health savings account, things that are funded upfront. My sense is somewhere between $35 million to $40 million for all the items because -- somewhere in there. It doesn't all reverse itself right away because it gets smoothed out over the course of the rest of the year, right? But you should see somewhere in there would be the drop, I would expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Dan DelMoro - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You actually have Dan DelMoro on the call. Matt is not able to hop on. A couple of questions. I just want to clarify on the NIM. NIM should have benefited this quarter from the troughs redemption. So as we look forward in the printed NIM, are you still expecting about the same decline outside of the core -- 2-bit core NIM compression?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, nothing has changed, if I get that right. I mean, to your specific item, we did that halfway through the quarter, right? So I guess there's still some benefit there. But I think all of that is really included in our thought that if we weren't adding unsecured debt and liquid securities, we'd be seeing about 2 basis points every quarter in compression.","Dan DelMoro - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Great. And just moving onto the fee income, you mentioned that most of your businesses bounced back in March after a slow January and February, which I'd assume is partly due to some of the extreme weather. Was there anything else to note that attributed to the weaker activity? And also, what's your overall rebound in March as we try to look forward?","Rene F. Jones","So that's a good question. I mean, it was very unusual in that almost everywhere you look, things were slow. So whether it'd be in our residential mortgage business, things were slow until we got the March, then we saw a pickup. If you go to loan volume in terms of pipeline, the same is true. If you look at our lock box volume, which is centered in upstate New York in the Mid-Atlantic, they would -- lock box in the first quarter volumes were significantly down, which is customer behavior, right? If you look at wires, handled out of our Western New York wire office, those were down significantly in January and February, picked up in March. If you look at debit card transactions, those were down, I think, 17% quarter-over-quarter but had an uptick in March. So almost every topic you looked at was affected. So my sense is, although I've not seen that before, that -- that it was something about the economy as a whole as opposed to something specific to M&T.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just first, another follow-up on the expenses. You talked about the $34 million decline in the professional fees. Can you just give us a sense of what really drove the decline this quarter? Was it the completion of CCAR? A milestone in the systems? And then when you think out, you're saying that we're going to see a decline post 3Q. What is the milestone that we're going to reach that will allow them to come down once you reach that point?","Rene F. Jones","Okay. Yes, sure, Brian. I mean, I guess, the best example I -- or logic I can give for the fourth quarter was that -- think about this. In order to be able to get to where we were at March 31 with the new program and onboarding all of our customers, most of the significant technology work on aggregating customers and focusing on gathering new information and putting those processes in, a lot of technology work is going to happen upfront because you can't begin those people-intensive process until you have your structure built. On top of that, all of the design of the program, using the outside consultants and ramping -- the ramp-up of the process, what I would suggest, one, it costs a lot, but then you become more efficient at the processes, as well. As you look through and remediate accounts, you become more efficient at that over time. So that's really what was behind -- a big part of what was behind the fourth quarter expenses being so high. It also -- to your point, a lot of what we've been doing over the course of last year on CCAR, I think was probably higher than it will be this year. Even though we'll continue to spend this year, that upfront engagement of what we're trying to do to meet the first test was pretty high. So I don't know if that helps, but that's kind of what we saw. And then I guess as we kind of move forward there, as -- we get the bulk of all of our processes in place and we're able to go back and look at how that new process affects our existing customer base, you begin, at some point, to start to move much more towards a normal process of rescreening your accounts and screening new accounts that are coming on, which is a much-less-costly process than kind of starting from where we are and looking at your existing book of, I think we've got 3.5 million customers and 5 million accounts, right? So you have to get through that whole process.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Just a follow-up on the LCR. And when you think about the additions that you've done over the past couple of quarters, securities book is up almost up 100%. And I know you're saying that you'll likely be where you need to be by the end of the year. But can you give us a sense of the magnitude of how far you think you are in terms of the securities additions? Will we have another step up from here or would you expect to continue at a pace somewhere to what we've seen in the past couple of quarters?","Rene F. Jones","I'd say we have got more work to do. I would say I was very pleased that we got a significant portion of what we need to do done in the first quarter. So more to do. And then I guess beyond there, it's hard to comment because we've got to see the rule, right? So and I think it's hard to suggest. But I think we're ahead of plan. And I think with that, you'll see a noticeable amount of new volume. But I think we're ahead of where we thought we would be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","Just following up on the January and February comments. Does it feel like all that activity was just lost and March is returning to kind of the run rate you had budgeted on these various metrics? Or are there some line items that could have a doubling-up affect in 2Q, for lack of a better term? So stuff that would have normally happened in 1Q getting pushed into 2Q, plus than normal volume that you would've expected in 2Q?","Rene F. Jones","I'd say, I don't know, Brian. I don't know. All I know is that March looked more normal. And if -- had February and January looked like March, we would have been happy. But it's hard to predict the customer behavior from here.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","Fair enough. And then going back to the annual letter. There were a couple of stats on the New Jersey build-out with 171 employees, $878 million in loans. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a general update. How's that going, how are those lenders progressing and how's the business volume in New Jersey coming in this kind of interim period before Hudson City comes onboard?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. Thanks for the question. It's going very, very well. About a month-or-so ago, Kevin Pearson and I went down and we had a grand opening of our new New Jersey office, which means the majority of those folks that Bob listed, the 171 people, are all located in one particular office. And they have been generating business and working really well together. What's nice about it is that but for the fact that we don't have the branches, you've got every single M&T business division in that same office working together around leads. Both loans and deposits have been growing. I think Bob covered that in his stats in the message. So we've got a wealth management team set up there. So things look like it's going pretty well. And at some point in time, if we can get ourselves with a nice branch network behind us, it'll be a bonus on top of that. It kind of reminds me of -- if you've known M&T for a while, over the years, we've done -- we've been able to do a great deal of work at building a franchise or a community bank in places like Albany or the Hudson Valley before we were able -- ever able to have the benefit of a branch network. And I think there's something special about that. It builds a lot of character. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just the umpteenth follow-up question on expenses, Rene, if I could. You mentioned that the expense base will remain elevated through 3Q, '14. So I guess, 2 follow-up questions from there. First, is it too optimistic to assume or project that the fourth quarter expense base could go down to the mid-$600 million level? And two, because of the staffing additions that you mentioned when you answered Brian's question, does the definition of a normal expense base for M&T, has it shifted from here, and how much has it shifted?","Rene F. Jones","Okay, so couple of things. So I guess, we were at $692 million in the first quarter and we've got some elevated salaries expense. But if you start there, you're already in the mid-600s, right? And then from there, you've got to think to the reasons why the expenses are elevated. So beyond BSA\/AML, we are making improvements to our overall risk management structure because we're a larger institution. So while that spending is not as great, it'll probably last a little longer. And we talked about the build-out in the -- of our web banking platform and then investments we're making in that space and in the mobile space. So I think those will continue for a while. And then I think we've got one more -- another year of making sure that our capital planning process is really stable. So my sense is that it's not like a cliff. There's sort of a process we're going through, some of which will slow down at the end of this summer, but other things, which will continue and will reap the benefits over time. I think I said on the call last quarter that something -- that the idea that we would be the mid-55s and 50s number and an efficiency ratio was not unreasonable and it was in the long-term that a bank with this added infrastructure, because it's all leverageable, could operate in 50% to 55% space. And so that's how I would think about it in terms of long-term and maybe long-term efficiency ratio in those ranges.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up question on the LCR. As I think about the full year, should earning asset growth continue to outpace the mid-single digit loan growth that you mentioned?","Rene F. Jones","Well, with the liquidity coverage ratio, that's just going to be the case, yes, until we get to where we need to be. So, yes. Which is the sort of issue of what will drive the non-core margin compression, but the cost of that is -- there's no negative impact on the dollar amount of NII.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman of Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, just a couple of questions going back to the CCAR program. Number one, as you referred to in your remarks, I think that you're pretty much done on the preferred side, but I'd like to get a little bit more insight, if you could, just in terms of the net new capital issuance, if you will. With the Hudson City deal theoretically, the equity component moved up to 70% from 60%. I'm just wondering how we should think about that net new capital issue. And with the Fed's calculation on capital actions, your number went from 62 to 67. I'm just wondering if you could just provide a little bit more perspective behind that.","Rene F. Jones","Yes, the last one is easy. I don't know. 62, 67. Not my test, so I don't know. I was happy about it. The way to think about it, Todd, I guess, is that we were going into the test for the first time. And so that's one degree of uncertainty where all of the data that we've been submitted was going to run through to the Federal Reserves model. And then the other uncertainty is that we were doing just, I think, the only large bank transaction included in the stress test. So there was an amount of uncertainty there. And how do I think of uncertainty? I think we are very buttoned-down in terms of understanding the risks associated with Hudson City. We've looked at it a lot and we've looked at it for a long time now. But when you're taking something that -- an institution that's below $50 billion and you're running information on their mortgages and their data through a centralized stress test, again, there's uncertainty. So we just thought it was prudent to -- going into that situation, to assume that of the purchase price, we would assume that we would finance 70% of it. There's been no change in the agreement with the Hudson City and the Hudson City shareholders. That sort of brings me to sort of looking back at the economics. I mean, I think the way that we think about transactions whenever we talk to you about -- we announced that we're going to do a transaction and it makes economic sense. We are always starting with an internal rate of return that assumes 100% equity financing. And then we may choose to do 60% in the end or 70% or some other number, but what that means is that the return is that we told you upon announcement haven't changed. There's still 18-plus in terms of returns on IRR. And then to the extent that we -- we use less equity fine, that's a financing benefit. When we look at -- if we were to go through and use 70% in the transaction, as we look at the numbers, we still see a high-single digit accretion -- EPS accretion from the deal, high-single digit to low double-digit accretion, so not much has changed there. I think the one thing that we've noticed is that credit quality has improved at Hudson and -- which affects the marks in a positive way. And the other thing is that prepayment fees -- speeds have slowed, so it means that there's more net interest income than when we had originally announced the transaction and initial projections, right? So everything is held up well. I think our thought process was to try to be conservative and sort of help eliminate some of the uncertainties associated with putting that kind of a pro forma together and the test for the first time.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just to be clear, as you mentioned, this is not unusual, that you would go into the deal with 100% equity assumption, if you will. But then with that incremental 10%, you're talking more about -- or you still haven't figured out necessarily that incremental kind of 10% financing in terms of the structure that, that might take, if you will?","Rene F. Jones","No. I think the way I think about it is, at the time we get down to -- if and when we get down to that point, what we're committed to doing is making sure that our capital ratios are consistent with what we say in our stress test. And actually, for many, many years, we've made -- we've been very proud to do that with you folks. We're also doing that with our various regulatory bodies and that's how we're going to manage it to try to make sure we hit what we put in. I'll note, today, even today, if you look at the pace at which we generated capital in just the first 3 months, it's already higher than what we had in our base forecast ending up at 945. So we're generating capital quickly. As we get closer to a potential transaction there, we'll kind of make some decisions and decide what we need to do.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just if I could, on the mortgage side, you mentioned a couple of the items related to the mortgage this quarter. I was just wondering, again, just with the volumes coming down in the quarter, you guys have actually been able to keep your numbers high relative to the industry in terms of both year-over-year, as well as sequentially. Was there any change in the MSR this quarter? Was there any other color that you could add in terms of just, like, for example, the margin, the gain on sale, I think you said that it was a gain, I think, on the commercial side was relatively stable. But I'm just interested, kind of how the MSR was treated this quarter and the margin on the gain on sale, or anything else that kind of contributed kind of to a more stable mortgage line relative to the industry?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, yes. I mean, so in terms of the -- stick to the residential side for a minute. On the residential side, I mean, the gain on sale was relatively flat. We saw about a 10% decline in locked volume. We saw a 7% decline in application volume. It matters that it's lower, it's a lower decline. But then if you go to the applications, the applications were up, right? So that kind of gives you some sense that the activity was weighted towards the end of the quarter, but no change really in the gain on sale margins and I don't really expect one. I think the residential business has been relatively stable. It's taken a couple of quarters to come down to a normalized level, we seem to be there. What else did I miss in your question? Is there anything else?","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In the MSR?","Rene F. Jones","No change in the MSR. We didn't have any material change in MSR this quarter.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So with the application's up, if the pipeline has actually improved from year end going into April, it sounds like?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, slightly. It's up as opposed to what you saw in all of the lagging indicators.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, it seems like you were pretty negative on the CRE competition this quarter from the -- I think you said the conduit and the life insurers. What gives that to change? And do you expect it to change and also do you need it to change to get to your, I think it was mid-single digit loan growth or is most of that being pulled by C&I?","Rene F. Jones","No. I mean, I don't think we needed to change. I think this quarter -- I'm doing this off the top of my head, but in the last couple of quarters, our CRE growth has been about 2%. It was negative 1 annualized this quarter, so I don't know. Maybe that will bounce up and down. I don't expect us to see significant growth in CRE because of what you're saying in terms of the competition. And I think there are really 3 things, 3 broad things that are happening. One is what I mentioned and that's people looking for yields, so that's why you get the conduits where things are going into securities, you get the insurance companies who are also looking for yields. And so the low rate environment is driving that portion. Unless any of us expect that to change soon, my sense is that it will be around for a while. I think the second thing is that there's a whole another subset of folks, for example, who seem to be more aggressive in the multifamily space and I would assume it's because of the risk weighting on the assets. But relative to 1 year ago or so, we see more and more people interested in that multifamily space. And so I wouldn't expect that to change as well. I do anecdotally think that it has a lot to do with a favorable risk weighting, which in our mind, it tends to create risk in some way. So in those cases, we would tend to back away from those things, if the pricing and structure starts to fall outside of what we're normally comfortable with. And then finally, the third space is that we get a lot of competition from the smaller institutions, institutions that are smaller than us around in the community banking space. And I'm not sure, anecdotally, I know that, for example, as the FDIC rules change and as capital changes, we're building those into our models as RMs are making decisions every day. And it often wonders to me whether the smaller institutions are doing that as quickly and\/or whether or not they've got a reprieve from some of the rules that's having an effect. So how you look at all of those things, I can't imagine that we're going to see any change in the pace there. And so when I think about mid-single digit, I'm really thinking about the commercial bank as a whole. I'm throwing out the resi real estate because that's just really held-for-sale stuff. And I think we're probably pretty close -- we're probably like 3% growth even with the down quarter in CRE this quarter when you combine C&I and CRE.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the fee side, you mentioned the mid-single digits fee income growth outlook. What's the base that you're starting that from, the dollar amount?","Rene F. Jones","Last year.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So full year '13.","Rene F. Jones","Yes, yes. You got to throw out the security gains and the nonsense there. But just those regular categories, I think, without the securities gains, that's what we're looking at.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The core fees. Okay. And then within the trust fees, just curious given the market backdrop, what's holding it back there? Is it fee waivers on the money market fund side? What's the right way to think about that line item going forward?","Rene F. Jones","Well, definitely, fee waivers are there, but that's in the base. I mean, that's been for a very long time so you've got upside there as rates turn around. But I think for us, we've had year-over-year, I think the trust number first quarter was flat. I think from time to time, we have -- what we refer to is nonrecurring fees, but I don't think that's the right term. So for state fees and lumpiness and so forth. And we were on the downside this quarter. And so that was sort of led to our comments that we wouldn't be surprised to see it be a little stronger as we move into the rest of the year.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then back on loan pricing, you're just talking it. Given Basel III, LCR, et cetera, are you guys feel like you're pricing loans today for the current regulatory environment, meaning do you feel like you're ahead of the industry? And how much catch-up do you think the industry has to play and how long will that take?","Rene F. Jones","Well, I think -- I think, if I look at our statistics over many, many quarters, our pricing has been relatively consistent and we're reflecting the changes in the cost structure in a way that says the returns are a little lower than they used to be. But the pricing is relatively consistent. And the way I would characterize it is we're in there with the competition so we don't set the price, per se, but we compete. So that's driven mostly by the market. I think the way to look at it is there are certain triggers that we just don't like to go through in terms of what we're generating in terms of pricing and ROEs. Having said that, the other part of it is structure. And when I mentioned the commercial real estate process, there's been some structural issues, people are willing to go 10 years on things that we might go 5. So I think what's going to slow us down is probably if that continues to change and hit sort of a lower-level triggers. It's not broad-based, but we've seen, here and there, we could get -- beat out on the price on the CRE deal by 100 basis points. So if that continues and the number of times that continues goes up, I think you're going to see us be relatively slow. But if you go back to 2004, that's what was going on with us as well. We had almost no growth, particularly in New York City. And we couldn't quite understand it. We just felt the pricing was irrational. And lo and behold, you could kind of see that in the aftermath, that it was.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just last one, I don't know if you had much back-and-forth with the Fed, post the CCAR results, but just curious if you've got any color on the RWA difference between your [indiscernible] forecast and what the Fed had in their numbers?","Rene F. Jones","No, I don't know. But I would sort of just -- I don't know that I would work too much into it and especially given that we were in the middle of our CCAR submission, we're combining 2 banks and all of that, there's a lot of moving parts. But I don't have insight into what drove the change.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Really almost everything has been asked, but I'm just curious, on the trading account and FX gains line, that seemed particularly light this quarter. Was there anything unusual? And on a go-forward basis, when you talk about your full year fee income guidance, does that kind bump back into an $8 million to $10 million a quarter range?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, it was down, I think there's 2 things that are in there. One in particular is just movements with the market because it's the other side of some of our postretirement benefits that are there. But the other thing that's in there is our customer swap business. And so there was a lot of activity in the fourth quarter. That activity was just quiet, just like everything else, right? So my sense is that's very dependent upon rates. And if you were to see the rates come back down, then you get more activity going on there where people try to lock in to fix. And so that, if you look at what's happened recently, that would -- either your account would be right. I don't know about the exact dollar amount, but that's what the movement is.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And on the deposit service fees, they were obviously down year-over-year. I know you mentioned NSF. Is it -- as you sort of billed to the mid-single digit growth and all fee income year-over-year, is the expectation deposit service fees are lighter this year than last, as this quarter was lighter than last? Or did you get some sort of bounce back on that line?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, I do think so. I think that is definitely the case. I mean, if you get away from M&T and you look at national trends, there's a change in behavior that people are seeing, which is that there are fewer and fewer NSF-eligible type transactions, which I guess at the end of the day is a good thing. Customers said they're really understanding how the process works and they're adjusting their behavior, which is probably what you want to have happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bob mentioned in his letter to shareholders that the regulatory costs now represents just over 10% of your total operating expenses. Is that a number that we should kind of keep in mind going forward, that it will remain that elevated into the indefinite future?","Rene F. Jones","I know we'll spend -- my gut is that we'll spend more this year than we did last year. And then the question will become, how do we -- look, what's happened is that the regulation has come very fast. And so we had to -- we and other institutions have had to react to that change very rapidly. So you have existing processes in the bank and so really what you're doing is you're adding onto them and not necessarily with the time it takes to rethink everything. So my sense is, just pure numbers, it will be higher this year in 2014, but then we'll begin to start looking at -- we'll begin to start looking at how we are able to achieve those things in a more efficient manner and maybe it means that stuff starts to level off or come down a little bit. But there's still a lot of regulation that needs to get put in place, right? So I don't know if that helps. That's why we actually put it out there. We track it. It tells us a lot about what's going on in the industry. We'll continue to do it.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. Yes, you also pointed out, I think there are still hundreds of regulations, part of Dodd-Frank, that still need to be implemented. Can you share with us, you mentioned how the securities book increased, obviously, for LCR, what's the duration of your total investment portfolio today?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. If you would ask me that a couple of years ago, I think it was about 2.5 and now it's something like 4.7, 4.8. So if you look at that, in one sense, you could get alarmed by it. But I think the thing to think about is, as we moved from that 2.5 to 4, whatever, what we've been doing is we've been -- to the best of our ability, as we add those securities, we're trying to match it. So you saw the $1.5 billion, which was 5s and 3s, right? So that's sort of right in that space. So I think from a risk management perspective, we're probably about the same risk profile. But cosmetically, that number looks a little worse or a little longer.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Do you guys do stress testing of that portfolio should long term rates rise by 100 basis point, how they -- what the duration extension would be, and what it does to the value of the portfolio?","Rene F. Jones","We do -- I don't know if I have that exact number because we tend to look at the whole balance sheet as a whole, right? So we're looking at -- I don't think you're asking, so I won't give it to you, but it's 100 up and 100 down on NII. So yes, again, I don't know, Gerard. I mean, we can look at that, but I don't know that we would probably publish that because, at the end of the day, it's sort of about managing the whole balance sheet, right?","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Oh, yes. No, no, I agree. Unfortunately, all the banks are going to -- have to mark that securities portfolio through capital should rates ever rise, but that was really the question, so -- but I understand looking at the whole balance sheet, absolutely.","Rene F. Jones","Yes. We do, do that in our stress test, regardless of the fact that because we're under $250 million and $1 billion in assets, we have the ability to -- we don't have to do that method. We still actually run through that whole process of understanding what it would be in that situation. But I don't think -- I think the way the rules are written, you're not going to end up being longer than anybody. Everybody is going to be right in about the same place. And it's pretty short, actually, in total, I think.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. M&T over the years has been a very strong manager of their capital. Now we, of course, have Dodd-Frank and you've got to carry a lot more capitals similar to your peers. And with the Tier 1 common ratio today well over 9%, even when you went through your stress test I think you came out with about 6.7% stress ratio. What's the ideal Tier 1 common ratio that you think -- once all of this is behind us, you've got your BSA\/AML all taken care of, Hudson City is on board. So if we look out a couple of years, where is the comfortable level on capital?","Rene F. Jones","So the way I think about it, Gerard, is that -- you describe it well, I mean, we spend a lot of time understanding the risk in our balance sheet, the capital, how much it could fluctuate over the years. And we've done a pretty good job of managing it. But now the standards are a little different, right? So the standard is that not only do we have to do that, but on a national level, we have to go through the same exact test as everybody else. And I think the first part of my answer is that we're still going to a place where we want to make sure that those levels are predictable. Not our own internal models, but also the external models. And so we're very pleased about where we came out, going into the test with a 9.1% capital and coming out sort of in the middle of the pack, we think begins to show -- fit the risk profile of the institution. And as we get more comfortable with that, I think what you'll see is that we'll start getting right back into the process of making sure that if we have excess capital because it doesn't make sense to make loans, we'll have to try to figure out ways to give that back. It's just sort of where we are in the maturity of the process that sort of puts us, makes us reluctant to sort of talk about a particular number. And I think you'll learn more about that as we go through this year. And then I think once we go through one more test, it will be very clear and we can talk about it. But you got to -- unless you have transparency there and you're talking about the target ratio, when you give back capital, when you don't have a use for it, it's hard to sort of get -- to be really efficient. The other thing I would mention is that because we've held off on a number of things, we're not exactly very efficient today in the rest of the capital structure that we have. We still have a lot of sub-debt that's sitting around that is probably not necessary now. We have a fair amount of hybrids that are sitting around that are no longer necessary. In the past, we would probably start to begin to fine-tune that, but as you know, the way in which we're able to do that is go through to the next test and then -- right? And then ask for it then. So it takes a little longer to get there. I would hope that as we saw on the test that it's starting to tell us that we're getting right about to where we need to be. And as long as we can continue to perform that way, then I think you'll start to shape out -- that answer will start to round out for you.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, finally, I know you guys touched upon it in your -- Bob did in the shareholder letter about the amount of money you're spending on technology and for customer service, the ATM machines, et cetera, the upgrades there. Can you share with us on the mobile channel that you're using a metric or 2 on how many people are using and some of your competitors, for example, will give us the amount of deposits you're taking through the mobile channel. Do you have a similar number available?","Rene F. Jones","No, I actually don't have, Gerard. And I think today, it would be fair to say that that's not a large number for us. I think the way we're thinking about the use of those types of products and other things, you saw for example that this quarter -- you didn't see, but this quarter, we completed the rollout of our image ATMs in Delaware, which is the last place that we needed to have them across our network. So if you look at all of those things, we're trying to figure out how to use those devices to have a lower cost delivery system on the one hand. And then in places where we do not have a branch network, we're trying to figure out if those types of things can actually help us, right, in the absence of a branch network. So that's the way I would think about it. But we're in the early stages and I don't think sort of just the raw numbers would be maybe significant relative to some of the large national players.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one of the follow-up in some of your commentary on commercial lending. First of all, you mentioned you'd seen some strength both in New York Metro and in Pennsylvania. Just curious if you have any -- if you'd provide some color relative to some of the other markets, both Upstate New York and maybe closer to the D.C. area. And then any update on your commercial lending utilization rate would be appreciated.","Rene F. Jones","Yes, sure. Let me start at the back of that. I think last call, I mentioned something around 57%, 58% utilization. If I go and just focus just on the commercial bank, that number is a little different. That number last quarter would be about 51.7% and then this quarter would be about 52.1%, so just a slight uptick. And that's probably, if you look back over the quarters, you don't see much change quarter-to-quarter, but you've seen a positive trend overall. So that's across the commercial bank network. And then the performance sort of varies by product by region. So we saw, for example in Western New York, while we didn't have double-digit growth, in C&I, we had 4% annualized growth, as well as in commercial real estate. And then if you kind of flip down to Baltimore, Baltimore was soft on the C&I side, it was down 3% annualized, but it was pretty strong in the real estate side, which is 7% annualized growth there. So it's relatively mixed, which I think is good. I think particularly if pricing and competition continues to get frothy, what's nice about our model is we can sort of bounce around and focus on the opportunities that makes sense for us and so you'll see a shift there. So it's pretty varied across the regions.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then we constantly hear, at least media reports, suggesting that mid-sized business and smaller businesses are being a little bit left behind in terms of C&I growth. Are you seeing any greater demand from those types of borrowers across your markets than you saw perhaps 6 to 12 months ago?","Rene F. Jones","No. We're not seeing any change in business banking but -- no, I don't think so. I mean, if you look at the numbers, I guess, we've been creeping up in the larger space, in the middle market companies. But I would suggest is if you take our whole book, we tend to bank smaller companies as a whole, right? And so we're probably a proxy for business banking across the U.S. and we haven't seen much of a change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, can you quantify for us what the preferred dividend will look like going forward after this issuance run rates?","Rene F. Jones","I don't know if I can off the top of my head. I'm willing to.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I can follow up off-line on that.","Rene F. Jones","Well, no, what I would tell you is that it was light. It was light in the first quarter because we didn't declare the dividend on the new preferred. So I'll give you that. And then we will -- maybe we'll put something in our 10-Q, so that you guys can see that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So importantly, it steps up with this one now starting to pay in the second?","Rene F. Jones","Yes, yes, yes. [indiscernible]","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then second question is, Ren\u00e9, you've got $3 billion of cash on both an average and period end. And I'm wondering just, how do we think about that cash and then also your securities to earning assets ratio? Where do you think it should level out as you continue the LCR when you think about securities to earning assets and whether or not you're just living with an extra amount of cash that may or may not get invested over time?","Rene F. Jones","On the cash side, a lot of this is driven by our Wilmington business. And when we first came together, that number was about $2 billion of excess cash that Wilmington sort of brought to table. And now that's as high as, maybe $3.9 billion. And I guess, we're still learning about the -- as we go through the cycles on how sticky that is and what's a normal run rate tranche there. Today, we assume it's about $2 billion and we're running higher than that. So we don't do much associated with those funds, we don't really count them in our liquidity profile beyond that. And the -- I mean, you'll see it tick up a little bit and it's just going to stay there. I don't know how to answer it any different. We're just about getting to where we should be in terms of securities to total assets, but then it won't come down because that's how the coverage ratio works, right?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. I was just wondering more if there's just -- how much -- I know you're saying you're still building, but you used to have the lowest amount of loans to earning assets, highest amount of loans to earning assets, now we're growing. The follow-up question I just want to ask is, you mentioned a couple basis points of core, of the pricing compression. In this quarter, we had 4 basis points from the LCR. And so, again, if we're presuming we're still similar kind of growing into the LCR, then does that presume that all things equal, we're kind of still seeing the 6 basis points of margin compression until that investments is complete?","Rene F. Jones","Yes. I mean, I'm not sure about the exact number, but you're thinking about it the right way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Most of them have been answered, but just a couple of ones. In terms of commentary, Ren\u00e9, about loan growth and competition. And it sounded like you said some competitors were extending loan terms and the like. And it just seemed a little surprising to me in light of the regulatory environment that competitors are able to do that. It seems like regulatory have most banks sort of in a box dictating how much they can grow. So I'd like to get your perspective on that. And also, I know you run your bank pretty conservatively in the past, so I'm assuming you haven't changed LTVs much, particularly in the C&I side, so if you could just talk about that also, that would be helpful.","Rene F. Jones","Yes. I mean, again, I'm going in reverse, we haven't changed anything in terms of loan-to-values. We tend to be relatively conservative. In part, we can do that because we're banking for the most part our customers or clients who we've known for a very, very long time, right, and who know us and sort of know what our standards are. So that's not changing at all. Your question is a fantastic one. I've been thinking about it a lot. I don't really know the answer. I don't know if everybody is under the same pressure or scrutiny. But it is surprising what you see. And quite frankly, I think in general, with the larger players seem to be much more rational, which is consistent with the fact that everybody is going through the same new regulations and oversight and capital testing. I don't know what to think about the smaller folks and maybe some folks that are outside of the banking industry. And I think that's a good topic to follow going forward because you've got to wonder whether the risk is controlled or the risk is moving, right? But I don't know enough to figure -- to have an answer to that.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, you'd also talked about how conduits and insurance companies seeking yield who were essentially driving some of the price competition in the CRE market. And clearly the conduits are real estate investment conduits of some sort. But is there anything that precludes structurally these insurance companies from being a greater competitive force on the C&I side, or is that something that could happen going forward? Just want to get a sense for -- if it's just a matter of a yield differential. Any color on that?","Rene F. Jones","Well, the way I think about it is, those 2 are proxies for investments, right, and people seeking returns. So that's going to be driven heavily by the level of interest rates. I wouldn't expect to see competition on the C&I side because the loan part of that is just one of the things that we do. All of the ability to do cash management and help them, as I mentioned, lockbox and all those types of services, right, are really the core of what we do for those clients. Lending is just one component. So it will be very hard for an institution without those capabilities to compete with the large commercial bank.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just my last question. I know you've been asked this question about BSA\/AML probably 10 different ways, so I'll go -- I'll ask the 11th time in a different way. But in thinking about your expenses there in light of the fact that you went through the stress test and passed and I know you're saying there's more work to be done there, but the fact that you passed the stress test, doesn't that sort of imply that you're -- not to put a number out there, but I will, does it imply that you're seeing 90% of the way done simply because if you went that far along in the process then that could have been one of the issues that regulators could have balked at on a qualitative front. So why would that be the wrong way to think about it and doesn't it suggest that you're being somewhat conservative when you're thinking about expenses related to BSA\/AML, expecting somewhat of a benefit in Q4? Could we see a benefit before that?","Rene F. Jones","Okay. So this is -- thank you for the question. First, the regulatory environment is not going to change in the next couple of years. There's still a lot of regulation that's coming out. And there's been a fast change, so it's going to take a time to really embed those processes into what we do on a day-to-day basis. The other thing is just step back and think about maybe use like asset liability across the seasoned banks, right? So those things are extremely mature. As you see with liquidity coverage ratio, we're going to be running liquidity every -- on a daily basis. We've been there on asset liability for a very long time. The capital planning processes have to mature as well and that systems, people, repeatable process, right? So you've got to imagine that where we're going to get to is not a place where we're running an annual test or biannual test. But at any point in time, that as we're putting on business in our portfolios that change the risk profile, that we're going to be able to see those things real-time. So that is not a short-term test. And as some of my colleagues are telling me here, I guess the phrase is, \"The bar is getting higher,\" and I think that will continue to happen. I think relative to maybe the 18 that have been through this a couple of years before us, we're probably a year behind them in terms of what we need to do. So a lot of work to be done there. And so I wouldn't expect to see any slowdown on that front.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Thompson of Portales Partners.","Jennifer A.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Maria, and good morning. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I\u2019d like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don. And good morning, everyone. As we noted in the earnings press release this morning, we are quite pleased with M&T's results for the second quarter. Further actions by the Federal Reserve through a short-term interest rates back in March and more recently in June led the further expansion of our net interest margin by some 11 basis points which in turn contributed to 3% growth in net interest income, both of those compared to the first quarter. ","Compensation expense declined from seasonably high levels we typically see in the first quarter of the year, and overall expenses remain well controlled. Credit cost continues to be stable and nonaccrual loans declined slightly. We substantially completed CCAR 2016 capital plan with continued repurchases of common stock during the second quarter and receive no objection from the Federal Reserve as to our CCAR 2017 capital plan. ","Let's have look at the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.35 in the second quarter of 2017, up 11% from $2.12 in the first quarter of 2017 and up 19% from a $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter was $381 million, up 9% from $349 million in the linked quarter and up 13% from $336 million in the year ago quarter.","Recall that the results for the first quarter of 2017 reflected the impact from new accounting guidance for certain types of equity based compensation. Resulting in a tax benefit of $18 million or approximately $0.12 per common share. The impact in the recent quarter was not significant. There were no merger-related expenses in either the first or second quarter of 2017. However, results for the second quarter of 2016 included merger-related charges amounting to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share. ","Also included in GAAP results in the recent quarter or at the after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $5 million or $0.03 per common share, little change from the prior quarter. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.","M&T\u2019s net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $386 million, up 9% from $354 million in the linked quarter and up 10% from $351 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.38 for the recent quarter compared an increase of 11% from $2.15 in 2017\u2019s first quarter and up 15% from $2.07 in a second quarter of 2016.","On a GAAP basis, M&T\u2019s second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.27% and an annualized return on average common equity of 9.67%. That compares with rates of 1.15% and 8.89% respectively in the previous quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity of 1.33% and 14.18% for the recent quarter. Comparable returns were 1.21% and 13.05% in the first quarter of 2017. In accordance with SEC\u2019s guidelines, this morning\u2019s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","We turn our attention to the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $947 million in the second quarter of 2017, improved by $25 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin improved to 3.45%, up 11 basis points from 3.34% in the linked quarter. As was the case last quarter, the single biggest factor driving the wider margin accounting for an estimated 9 basis points of the increase was the Fed's action to increase short-term interest rates with the late mark action reaching its full run rate during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, reflecting the increase in mid-June.","The average balance of funds placed on deposit with the Fed declined by approximately $1.4 billion from the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of deposits received from trust clients engaged in capital markets transactions, as well as lower levels of Escrow deposits received in connection with our mortgage banking operations. We estimate that these factors produced the benefit to the margin of approximately 4 basis points. Offsetting these factors were several other items including continued core margin pressure. These items in aggregate amounted to approximately 2 basis points a pressure. ","Average loans were essentially flat compared to the linked quarter. Looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, we saw commercial and industrial loans up approximately 1% on an annualized basis. Commercial real estate loans were roughly flat. Residential mortgage loans continued the planned runoff at a 16% annualized rate, consist with our experience in the prior quarter. Consumer loans grew an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect auto loans and seasonal strength in recreation finance loans, offset by lower home equity lines and loans. The growth in consumer loans includes the benefit of approximately $130 million of auto loans that came back on to our balance sheet in the middle of the first quarter following the dissolution of our auto loans securitization. ","Regionally, we are continue to make progress in New Jersey with good growth numbers on what is still a fairly modest pace, and in line with total loans growth on the commercial side were subdued in most other regions. Pennsylvania was particularly soft on the C&I side but was above average in CRE volume. ","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T\u2019s Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 declined by some $2 billion from the first quarter, reflecting the lower balances of trust and mortgage escrow deposits as well as the continued runoff of time deposits acquired with Hudson City. Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $461 million in the second quarter compared with $447 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $86 million in the recent quarter compared with $85 million in the linked quarter.","Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $770 million in the quarter, up approximately 6% compared with the first quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $61 million compared with $58 million in the prior quarter. The higher origination volumes and a winder gain on sale margin contributed to the linked quarter increase. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $25 million in the recent quarter, down slightly from the prior quarter. ","Trust income was $127 million in the recent quarter, up from $120 million in the previous quarter. The increase included approximately $4 million in fees earned in connection with helping trust clients prepared the tax filing. Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million, up $2 million compared with the first quarter primarily reflecting higher levels of customer activity.","If the turn to expenses, operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude or made the amortization of intangible assets were $743 million, compared with $779 million in the previous quarter. Salaries and benefits declined by approximately $51 million from the prior quarter. The majority of which reflects the return to more normal run rate following the first quarter's seasonably high factors that I previously mentioned. Most expense categories remained well controlled with the exception of other cost of operations. The increase of which reflects higher legal related and professional services expenses. And these are likely to remain slightly elevated through the remainder of 2017.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator, was 52.7% in the recent quarter. That same ratio was 56.9% in the previous quarter and 55.1% in 2016\u2019s second quarter","Next, let's turn to credit. All of credit metrics are indicating that we remain in the benign part of the credit cycle. Nonaccrual loans decreased by $54 million to $872 million at June 30 and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined by 6 basis points to 0.98% compared with the end of the first quarter.","Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $45 million compared with $43 million in the first quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 20 basis points for the second quarter, up slightly from 19 basis points in the first quarter in line with what we've seen on average over the past three years.","The provision for credit losses was $52 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $7 million. The allowance for credit losses was $1 billion at the end of June. The ratio of the allowance to total loans increased slightly to 1.13%, reflecting a modestly higher proportion of commercial loans on the balance sheet.","Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value-discounted acquisition, were $265 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $235 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital. Over the quarter we completed our CCAR 2016 capital plan, repurchasing $225 million of common stock that remained under plan and the Board's repurchase authorization. Those repurchases, net of retain earnings, combined with the reduction in the balance sheet and in particular risk-weighted assets during the quarter, brought M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules to an estimated 10.8% compared with 10.67% at the end of $900 million of share repurchases over the four quarter period beginning July 1, 2017. In addition, the plan contemplates a $0.05 per share increase in the common stock dividend in the second quarter of 2018, subject to declaration by the Board in the ordinary course of business. ","Turning to the outlook. Halfway through 2017, our outlook is little changed from what we expected at the beginning of the year. We had two rate actions from the Fed this year which have had significant impact on a net interest margin and which have led the stronger than expected net interest income growth. On the other hand loan growth, we've seen has been less than we expected. For the year-to-date, average loans are up just under 2% compared with the first half of 2016. On that same basis, but excluding the impact from the runoff and residential mortgages, average loans increased 8.4% over the first half of 2016. At present, we don't see lending conditions being materially different in the second half of 2017 from what they were in the first half. ","We continue to expect average loans for the current year to be up in the low single digits versus 2016 with continued pay downs on residential mortgage loans, offset by modest growth year-over-year in commercial and consumer loans. The implied forward curve doesn't show any further rate actions by the Fed until late in the year. Given that, we expect more modest extension of the NIM from the current level and more modest growth in net interest than we saw in the first half of the year. We see the potential for some pressure on margin in the second half including loan spreads and the impact from refinancing some of our long-term debt. ","The outlook for the businesses is little changed. While we expect modest growth in mortgage banking revenues, we'll be pleased to match the strong results we saw in the second half of 2016, particularly on the commercial side. We continue to expect growth in the low to mid single digit range for other fee categories. ","Our expense outlook is also unchanged. We continue to expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2017 compared to last year. And as I noted, professional services including legal related costs are likely to remain elevated through the end of the year. ","Our outlook for credit continues to be little changed from recent trends. But as we've indicated in prior quarters, credit has been benign for several years and that we continue to view credit as more of a downside risk than an upside opportunity. ","As to capital, given our strong operating performance and solid capital ratios, we expect to begin execution of our 2017 capital plan shortly. You may have seen our 8-K filing yesterday, noting that the Board has authorized a new buyback program in connection with the 2017 CCAR capital plan. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Maria will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Darren, I was wondering if you could just expand on the loan growth side. C&I was down at period end basis and I think you mentioned CRE was slower and that overall growth has been slower than expected. So understanding you are still expecting low single digit average for the year. Can you help us understand just point to point growth from here? Where you expect to grow especially in the non real estate runoff categories? ","Darren King ","Sure. So let's just kind of walk through each of the categories to try and help give a little clarity to what we were expecting to happen. If we start with the non residential real estate consumer loan side, and you look at where the growth has been, it has been primarily in indirect both in auto and rec fi and those growth rates has been pretty consistent over the first half of the year. And fairly consistent with what we saw in 2016. So we expect those trends to continue. And our rec fi was little high in the second quarter which is fairly typical given that it's bodes and are reason that tends to be the time of the year when people are looking for those kinds of vehicles. When we -- residential real estate, it has been in a run down mode since acquired the Hudson City portfolio and the rate has averaged kind of 14% to 16% a quarter and we foresee that continuing. When we look at the commercial real estate part of the balance sheet, it's been relatively flat this year. And there are a couple things that are going on within the portfolio. Notably, some of the construction balances that we originated in late 2014 and 2015, those projects have kind of under completion and are converting to permanent. And often times the permanent financing is something that happens outside of the bank. So we are seeing a little bit of shift in the commercial real estate balance mix, a little bit away from construction towards more permanent. And that shift is leading us to the more flat in terms of where those balances have been for the first half of the year. But the mix is helpful from a risk weighted asset perspective. On the C&I side, what we've been seeing is slow growth and they kind of bounces around a little bit within the quarter. When we look by industry we don't see any industry that sticks out really positively or negatively. And when we look by geography, we are not really seeing anything that sticks out positively or negatively. What I think we are seeing or what I guess the feedback that we receive when talking to our customers about their thoughts, the word that I was come back to is uncertainty. And the thing that is on everyone's mind or appears to be is when we will have some direction out of Washington on several factors. When we talk to healthcare clients for instance, which we do a lot of business in skilled nursing facilities, the Affordable Care Act is at the front and center of their thought process. And the uncertainty in which direction it might go is leading them to pause before making any investments so that they know what they might be able to expect from a cash flow perspective before they take on new debt and consider expansion. We talked to manufacturing clients; we see some interest in expansion. Their first priority would be to grow by maybe adding some capacity through second shifts or additional labor. But the labor markets are tough for them to find skilled workers and they are reticent to invest in new equipment at the moment again given the uncertainties around where the economy is going. So that's kind of the background to our outlook and we are not dire on the economy by any stretch. But I'd say there are some uncertainty and some cautiousness that when we look at the balance sheets of our customers and you saw it in our credit performance metrics, the business is very healthy. They are still more optimistic than they were at the start or at this point last year. Maybe it's come down a little bit since the election highs but it's still generally optimistic. They are just waiting for a little more certainty before they make any decisions and those companies that are investing are leaning more on their cash which have been at all time high in their business rather than taking on new debt. So until we get some little bit more certainty out of Washington I think we are likely in the spot for a little while longer and that's what is reflected in our comments. Now we think that C&I will be a slow growth part of the portfolio over the next couple of quarters. ","Ken Usdin","Yes. That's great color, Darren. Thank you. And just one quick follow up on the overall size of the balance sheet. You mentioned all the escrow deposits and the securities related stuff. Would you say that the average for this quarter was abnormally low just given the size of the balance sheet shrunk by few billion and how would you just explain that episodic nature of them? ","Darren King ","Sure. When you look at some of the components in those Fed balances and you start to see it also in the deposit balances on the other side of the ledger. You've got some volatility in some of the escrow balances, as well as in what we call trust demand deposit which are a function of some of the M&A activity that's going on in the marketplace. And those two sets of balances will move around a little bit as activity, M&A activity shifts as well as our mortgage servicing customers look at third balances and try to manage their interest income. So you'll see a little bit of volatility in those when we look at where the cash balances were this quarter. It's probably in the right range as we go forward but they will tend to move around. I'll remind you that at this point last year they were over $10 billion. We've seen them move around and come back down into what we consider a more normal range over the course of the first half of this year. And as we go forward my best advice is to think kind of in the $4 billion to $6 billion range and those things can move around a little bit within that spectrum. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I just want to follow up on the outlook for the NIM. I think you said something about -- first you said modest NIM expansion back half of the year but then you said there could be some NIM pressure from issuing long-term debt and some other moving pieces. So I was just hoping to flush that out in terms of what's specifically you are pointing to over the back half of the year?","Darren King ","Sure. So we haven't seen the full benefit of the June hike in the second quarter's NIM so there is some upside we believe we are projecting based on that increase. But it won't be the whole increase that we traditionally seen. And we think that will be muted slightly by some pressure we see on loan margins as well as by the debt that we are going to issue. But overall we expect some extension in the margin in the third quarter and probably leveling off a little bit in the fourth given that there are no rate increases projected until December. ","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could elaborate a bit on the CCAR ask on the buyback down quite a bit on for previous year. But loan growth still feels like it relatively subdued. So why not ask for a higher buyback and retain capital outweigh when growing the loan book is tough given the Hudson City runoff. ","Darren King ","Sure. Happy to elaborate on that, Geoff. And your thought process is very consistent with how we think about things. When went into CCAR 2017, the expectations for the economy and for loan growth were a lot different than what they proved to be over the course of the last six months and clearly over the last three. So we put our projections together and we put our baseline together. We are all given scenarios that you have GDP growth and employment forecast and based on those we project forward what we think our growth will be both in loans and balances as well as interest income. Fees what have you to calculate PPNR. And what I think is happened -- more than what I think is happened what I know is happened is reality has had rate increases come faster than what was those in CCAR projections and loan growth is a little bit slower which is creating more capital for us and for the industry. And if we had seen that information in those projections then our asks certainly would have been different than what it was. When we kind of expected that it would be down a little bit year-over-year just given the magnitude of the ask-in in 2016 because of this excess capital we are carrying as a result of the Hudson City acquisition. But overall when we look at CCAR and how things went this year, we are actually quite optimistic in how things went. Obviously getting our approval was a good thing but when we look at some of the changes and how the Fed's models are working in particular when you look at PPNR, we think they've started to take a more company specific approach to how they evaluate PPNR. And we saw our PPNR percentage of assets over the nine quarter project period go up and it went up pretty much more than anyone else in our peer group. And we think reflects the consistent earnings that we've had in the low volatility of earnings that we produce. So that's a positive on a go forward basis. And we also saw decrease in the loss rate's forecast on the mortgage portfolio. They are still high by our estimates. But part of what's in there is I know a service by others portfolio where some of the information is harder to get and to provide as part of our submission. But that's a declining portfolio. So when we look at where we are we see a lot of positives going forward that the PPNR puts us in a good position. And obviously the margin increase and the capitals that we are producing every quarter sets us up well and the loan growth -- we like to see the loan growth but if doesn't come we will -- that will also create capitals that we will be able to distribute in the future. So overall in our eyes it's -- it was positive outcome and we look forward to next year. ","Geoffrey Elliott","And then in terms of use of capital. How far away do you think you are from being able to get back to M&A? Where the things stand with the written agreement?","Darren King ","So with regards to written agreement, we are working with our regulators now to go through the work that we've completed and to make sure that it is 100% compliant with the terms of written agreement and that we fulfilled all of our obligations which we of course believe we have done. And we are just working through that with the regulators now to -- hope that they will agree with our assessment and we will be able to have a positive resolution to that sometime this year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Thank you for all the color on the second half of the year. I'm wondering if I could just assume Darren you talked about an efficiency ratio target at the low end of your 55% to 57% range. Given that this quarter came in at 52.7% should we expect that efficiency outlook is still valid or could you fall below that range?","Darren King ","It's given where we've been for the first half of the year. It's probably likely that we'll end up a little bit below the 55% range. This quarter was abnormally low, even exceeded our own expectations. And I think there is a couple -- one primary factor there which is deposit pricing just hasn't been as reactive as I don't think we are or anyone in the industry thought which really create a lot of net interest income and helped to bring that efficiency ratio down. As we look forward we believe at some point we are going to start to see that. It hasn't happened yet but we'll start to see that and as I mentioned before we'll have a little bit of elevation in expenses of the second quarter number for some of the legal issues that we are working on. And the combination of those two things I suspect will have the efficiency ratio little bit higher than where it was in the second quarter but full year we are likely to be below the 55%, the bottom end of the 55% that we've talked about earlier in the year. ","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And my follow up question is really sort of piggybacking off of Geoffrey's line questioning. So you mentioned that the Fed is getting better at being more specific about its stress testing. You mentioned PPNR improvement and continued improvement in losses that actually reflect your risk profile. I'm wondering if your shareholders can look forward to the resumption of capital payout growth in 2018. And if you think about payout versus M&A, if you could give us some insight on the decision tree there especially given where you are valued on a tangible book basis.","Darren King ","Sure. So all else equal if we were -- if we were starting the 2018 capital plan submission today, the distribution request would likely be higher than what it is or was in 2017. Just given the fact that our capital ratios have gone up and that the net income -- sorry the PPNR production is also improved. And it's always been our philosophy and how we run the bank to put that shareholder capital to best use and a return above our long-term cost to capital. We typically want to invest that in the business which is by growing the business. And then after that we look to distribute to the shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. When we look at M&A, we don't hold excess capital on the comp hoping that M&A will show up. We've always been successful going to the market if we need capital to fund an acquisition and raising that capital because of our shareholder return focus and generally the positive financial nature of the deals that we've been able to do in the past. And we would expect that to continue. So now when we look at where we sit from a capital perspective, we continue to target operating at the low end of the peer range in terms of our CET-1 ratio given our credit history and our low volatility of earnings. And put that money back to work first in the business. Second, distribute to shareholders and then as acquisition opportunities present themselves, and if they are attractive from financial perspective as well as from a strategic perspective then we would put that money to work in an acquisition.","Erika Najarian","And just one technical question and thank you for that response. When banks file their capital plan for the CCAR process, do you have to ask upfront you know that you know deal is part of your strategy over the next four quarters or that can happen outside of CCAR -- formal CCAR planning? ","Darren King ","So the process is you would not put anything in the plan that wasn't definite. So in the plan if you already had a merger agreement in place then your CCAR plan would include the assumption that deal closed during the CCAR period. You would forecast the PPNR of the combined entity. You would forecast the charge-offs in the combined entity and you would look at what your capital ratios are, assuming that two organizations will merge and then you would make your capital distribution request based on that. You wouldn't hold capital and put in a deal that isn't even on the table on the assumption that something might happen. It's got to be known to the extent that a merger presents itself in the middle of the period; you would resubmit or provide an updated capital plan and kind of mini CCAR if you will, with your merger request. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the back to the loan growth detail. And thanks for the color you gave there but what I am trying to get more info on is, on the C&I decline and the end of CRE balances. What was that exactly attributable to? And then when you look at where C&I in isolation could grow in coming quarters. I know you had indicated that there are several factors and that could be volatile. Are we looking at similar low single digit range for that as well? And I guess the similar question for CRE given the kind of financing factors you see in there. ","Darren King ","So on C&I and when you look at what's going on with the balances within there, there is a number of components that are happening. One, when you look at credit lines and line utilization. We saw those cap out in the second quarter and start to flatten out. So people not drawing on the lines anymore are one thing that starts to slowdown the growth. I'll remind you that history has said that in the third quarter we tend to see a decrease in C&I balance because of our auto floor plan business that is the model year changeover. You tend to see a decrease in the third quarter before the new model year start to show up in the showroom floor, which tends to increase in the fourth quarter. And then when you look more broadly at the C&I, whenever in any quarter and in any year there is a mix of pay down, pay offs and new originations. And when you see the decrease in loan balances it's generally a function of the pace of new originations as opposed you see us speed up in pay down. So when we look at the loan growth that we had and what we foresee, it's not that we are seeing charges-off increase that are bringing balances down or prepayment speed increase. What we are just seeing is more cautious attitude from our customers towards the future and originations being a little bit slower than what we had seen through 2016.","John Pancari","Okay. That's helpful. And on commercial real estate. Given the volatility there, given the pressure or the shifting you are seeing from some of the construction credits now moving into permanent financing that implies that you don't have the back fill happening with incremental construction growth. And therefore front end issue there as well. Is that likely the case and that keep CRE flattish? ","Darren King ","I think CRE will be flattish to slightly growing. It's obviously a function of activity and what's going on in the construction and real estate market in general. We did see a little bit of slowdown in construction; at least with our customer base overall the last sort of while they have been working on the projects that we had financed for them through 2016 and in latter half of 2015. Now if you look at where our growth was last year, particularly in the second half of the year was very heavy in CRE and in construction. And our customers are busy with those projects and not taking on new business. Over time those will come to pay down and we mentioned I think a couple of times that will flip into more of a pay down mode in the construction side over the course of the second half of 2017 and into 2018. And then we'll see where new activity goes. And whether it picks back up on the construction side or shifts more towards the permanent site. ","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks. And then last Darren just around the deposit base. I know you had indicated that so far they remain low. You just indicated where you have seen them post the June hike and where you expect they can move. Thanks. ","Darren King ","It's a great question. It's a tough one to handicap only because we are still in a territory we've never been in before. And we all keep expecting that something is going to happen but it hasn't. So on the side that says things will stay the way they are. You see bank loan to deposit ratio is still below a 100%. You see changes in the money fund industry and that alternative is still less attractive than it was. And you see absolute Fed fund rates lower than they were at the end of the last time Fed funds were this low. So it's still little bit of un-chartered territory. On the side that you say we might start to see movement, certain customers especially larger balanced customers will start to pay more attention to the rates that they are getting. And we'll see a little bit of pressure there but at this point we still are expecting that they just will remain relatively low for one more hike at least maybe two. And in terms of where we are seeing any activity all tends to be larger balanced customers where it's more of one off conversation. Where we are talking to them based on our total relationship, being a relationship oriented bank. And we see some movement on the consumer side generally in the CD space mainly in the 1and 12 months terms. You seem some kind of new terms coming up of 13 and 14 months from certain competitors and certain geographies but overall pricing has been fairly stable. And we anticipate that it's likely to continue that way for the next little while. If you do see any increase in deposit, often times they are customers who have an index driven rate and when you see the rates move it's because the index move. But overall still pretty quite on the deposit front. ","Operator","Our next question comes from line of David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the color, Darren. Maybe just couple of kind of other topic. You mentioned a couple of times you guys can growing in indirect auto. And I am just curious what you guys are seeing from the competitive backdrop there? Whether guys kind of pulling out, are you seeing that have an impact on pricing return in that market? Are things getting better there?","Darren King ","It's a great question. And it's something that we spend a lot of time looking at given the nature of that business and how competitive it is and how good accessed information is from the dealer network about what others are doing. And we are aware of the pull back that we've seen from others industry. It had relatively modest effect on our origination so far. Mainly because the space that we operate in isn't the super prime and it's not the subprime. It's not even really the near prime. It's kind of the lower end of prime. I don't know whether there is such a category or not maybe we are naming one here. But that customer base and that credit window that we've operated in has been pretty consistent for probably the last three or four years. And the volumes that we originate have also been fairly steady month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. They can move around if we average let say $120 million a month, it can drop down to $100 million and it can go up to $140 million, $150 million but we don't see it doubling in any month or quarter or shrinking down materially below $100 million because that customer space where we are looking at cyco, we are looking at the vehicle itself and the term is spot where we have been pretty consistent and our volumes have been pretty consistent as a result. ","David Eads","Great. Thanks. And then I know you have talked on securities portfolio but the yield went down sequentially that was little surprising to me. And you guys had talked about bringing down asset sensitivity and what was implies anyway -- I was kind of expected that you maybe walk something in longer term in securities line and leads a little bit more extension. Can you just kind of walk through the dynamic there?","Darren King ","So on the securities portfolio, there is a couple things. We slowdown little bit some of the reinvestment of the cash flows that we were paying off from the mortgage backed securities. And we did a little repositioning of the securities portfolio to increase the percentage that is in Ginnie Mae in particular to improve the percentage to qualify as the top tier of high quality of liquid assets. And as we made that switch you start to see a little bit movement in the margin because those tend to have slightly lower coupon than the other asset categories. But there is no change that we made in terms of the duration of the portfolio and yes --","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Good morning, gentleman. So, Darren, just a follow up question to what John had asked you about loan growth. And I know you said there weren't any significant pay downs you saw. It was more from an origination perspective, there is more muted on the origination side. Is there any correlation to the big drawdown in the noninterest securing deposits and maybe some of those market customers they are just accessing the success equity versus trying to go out and take out a loan just what kind of fund their operations until they get more clarity from what's going on in Washington? Is that anything you are hearing from your customers? ","Darren King ","It's definitely we are hearing it from the RMs Brian but if you look at the decrease in those deposit balances, the biggest drivers are really the escrow balances and the trust demand balances. They are maybe a little of it, that's part of the phenomenon that you are referencing. But at this point or for this quarter I should say that wasn't the biggest driver there. It was really more of the escrow and the trust demand.","Brian Klock","Got it. Thanks for that. And the fee income side and the other miscellaneous fee income. It seemed like it was up this quarter about $6 million sequentially. Anything in there that's nonrecurring or anything that's -- or is that [1.17] a better run rate that use going forward. ","Darren King ","So when you look at that line item, Brian, there is a couple of things that were really driving the change quarter-to-quarter. One was loan fees. We had a fairly active quarter in our advisory and syndication parts of the bank. So they had a very strong quarter. And then the other part of it is our investment in Bayview and that the over time the carrying cost of that is now down to zero. So instead of that number being negative in that other income line is now zero. So that one is definitely recurring and will be around for a while. The loan fees obviously we are hopeful that those will continue at that level but obviously that moves around with the market. ","Brian Klock","Okay. So within they are the -- usually the insurance income is usually little bit seasonally softer in the second quarter or is that after good first quarter was the insurance revenues offset in there even though these other items were positive.","Darren King ","It was materially different. ","Brian Klock","Okay. And just one last question on the deposit side. With the time deposit again you had another quarter of sequential decline in the rate pay down time deposit. I know you talked about the Hudson City remixing and reprising of that. I guess how much more do you think --should we see similar types of decline as we go into the back half of the year on the cost to time deposits.","Darren King ","So the rate of decrease should start to slow in particular as it relates to the margin. So when you look at what's in that book slightly over half is less than a year in terms of duration. And skewed towards six months and less. There is half of the book that we still need to reprise. But it will reprise over a longer time horizon because those were time deposits that we are carrying at two, three and five year term on them. And it's going to take the course of the next couple of years for those to reprise. So you've got half of the book that has been reprised probably couple of times already and are closer to market rate. And then you've got the other half that will reprise probably in equal proportions over the next three years. ","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Good morning. I just want to go back to the reducing some of the assets sensitivity that you talked about in the past. Can you just give you an update where it stands today and kind of how it's going to trend going forward?","Darren King ","Sure. If you look at the bank overall, we remain asset sensitive. That sensitivity is come down a little bit in the second quarter and you probably see that in the Q when it comes out that when you look at the impact of rates moving up or down 100 basis points which will you see is a slightly lower increase in net interest income when rates go up. But the offset is that obviously is that if rates were to drop you would see a slightly less smaller decrease in net interest income when rates go down. And really what we were thinking over the course of the start of the year was that we had an extra hike that we didn't anticipate. I don't think anyone did in March. And that the rate increases given our asset sensitivity create a lot of net interest income. And not that we are expecting rates go down. But if rates were to go down, with deposits not reprising that increase would equally go away. And we though it was prudent, and again as we think about managing the bank for lower volatility, start to lock in a little bit of that. And in the quarter we hedged about $4 billion of the balance sheet and give it in kind of equal parts of loan hedges or cash flow hedges as well as deposit related hedges or funding hedges, debt hedges and that produce that change in sensitivity which lower the asset sensitivity a little bit. And whether we do more or not remains to be seen depending on what the forward curves look like. But as rates move throughout the quarter we didn't think that it made sense to continue that so we stopped it at $4 billion. ","Peter Winter","Great. And did any of that contribute to some of the margin expansion this quarter? ","Darren King ","It helped a little bit. But really it's just more -- we had hedged and kind of locked in the forward curve. So the curve, as long as it shows up the way we expect it, it doesn't have a material impact on the margin. But it was about as expected and the impact on the margin this quarter was really not material. ","Peter Winter","Thanks. And just one quick follow up on CCAR. There have been a couple of questions, results were very good, capitals building, I am just wondering if is there any thoughts of possibly resubmitting a capital plan later this year?","Darren King ","It's a good question. We are focused in the last little while on getting through the quarter and doing our work to see where the capital ratios ended up given the strong performance. And we'll take a look and see and if we decided to do something we'll let you know. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one question. Our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. ","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Darren. How are you? Good, thank you. Can you give us an update on just on the written agreement that you have with the regulators? I think you have been saying that you hope to have it lifted by the end of the year. Is there any update there? And second as part of that, with the changes in Washington not really having heads of the OCC, TROs position is not been replaced yet either. Does that complicated at all for you guys?","Darren King ","So I'll start with the first part. I unfortunately I have no news to share with you on the written agreement. I mentioned earlier that we've completed our work and we are working with our regulators now to review that to make sure that they concur with our assessment that we have fulfilled all of our obligations under the written agreement. And then from there we kind of go to Washington to review that work and hopefully obtain agreement that we have completed all the parts of the written agreement. Within Washington, there are enough staffers around that have been there to make a decision but I think it's probably a little bit difficult. And this is speculation on my part right that without someone in those positions that it might be a little bit more difficult to finalize that. But I don't know how the workings at the Fed, how the Fed operates internally to say that's definitively a help or hindrance to us getting, giving some progress on the written agreement. ","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just as a follow up, you guys obviously have spent an enormous amount of capital and money to meet the terms of the written agreement and I believe if Bob put in the letter, shareholder letter that share that total regulatory expense is now are about $440 million which are up meaningful from pre crisis or around the crisis time. Should we anticipate once the written agreement is lifted and your systems are all running smooth, that the $440 million could come down a bit because I am assuming part of that number was to build out what you need to build out? Now it's more just maintain and improves what you have. ","Darren King ","So, George, the way I would think about the $440 million is that's largely the run rate going forward. And there are a number of components that are part of that. Some of those are what we would consider a little bit more soft dollar cost if you will. And that it is time a front line staff talking to our customers about regulatory related things, collecting information what have you. And so those folks will still be around talking to customers. We just hope that they are going to talk more about business and a little less about their documentation. So those expenses will go away. We have added expense in our compliance department for the AML\/BSA functions as well as for some of the modeling related to CCAR and stress test. And as we continue to get smarter and more sophisticated in those areas, we expect there to be some efficiency gains. But you are not going to see $440 million go down to $200 million. We are talking more like 5% to 10% kind of normal efficiency gain so you can get through time through automation and process improvement as opposed to material parts of the operation go away.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answers session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Christy. This is Don MacLeod. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the web cast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our web site, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. As I noted in this morning's press release, M&T reported a 6% increase in net income, and diluted earnings per share growth of 2% from the first quarter of last year. We were able to eke out modest growth in revenue in a difficult environment, which combined with continued favorable credit performance and disciplined expense management to produce positive operating leverage, even while we made investments to improve the franchise, and to more efficiently server our stakeholders. A higher share count accounted for the lower pace of growth in earnings per share, as our capital levels continue to grow.","We have a lot to talk about today, our results, progress on our initiatives and some recent announcements, as we usually do, I will start by reviewing a few of the highlights from the first quarter results, after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions. Remember, that you can reenter the queue if you have additional questions that haven't been answered.","Turning to the results, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.65 for the first quarter of 2015, up from $1.61 in the first quarter of 2014, that figure was $1.92 in the fourth quarter of last year. Net income for the quarter was $242 million, up 6% from $229 million in the year ago quarter, and $278 million in the linked quarter. ","As you are all aware, since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental recording of its results on net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $4 billion or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter.","M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization was $246 million, up from $235 million in last year's first quarter, but down from $282 million in the linked quarter. Net operating earnings per common share were $1.68 for the recent quarter, compared with $1.66 in the year ago quarter, and $1.95 in the previous quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.08% and 11.90% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 13.55% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Before we get to the specifics, note that effective January 1, 2015, M&T adopted amended guidance from the financial accounting standards board, for investments in qualified affordable housing project. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a significant affect on M&T's financial position, or results of operation, but did result in the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for 2014, and earlier years, to remove the net costs associated with qualified affordable housing projects from the non-interest expense, and include the amortization of the investment in income tax expense.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $665 million for the first quarter of 2015, a decline of $22 million from a linked quarter. Contributing to that decline was the normal impact from two fewer accrual days in the quarter, which reduced interest income by an estimated $10 million. An additional $5 million reduction in interest income was driven primarily by the accelerated amortization of the premium on certain mortgage backed securities. This follows the reduction in guarantee fees on newly originated FHA mortgage loans, and the resulting uptick in the refinancing of loans backed by some of our Ginnie Mae securities. For our expectations for prepayments speeds to unchanged, we wouldn't expect this to reoccur next quarter.","We took further steps towards reaching LCR compliance during the quarter, by issuing $1.5 billion of unsecured bank notes, and using the proceeds to purchase additional high quality liquid assets, with lower yields than we previously obtained. The combination of those transactions reduced the net interest income by an estimated $4 million, we will discuss our LCR program further, when we get into the outlook.","Finally, there was a $4 billion decline in average deposits from our institutional trust business. Recall, that excess deposit balances reside at the Federal Reserve. That decline occurred prior to the end of the fourth quarter, and was reflected on the balance sheet at December 31. Although those transactions generated a very narrow spread, the large decline in those balances reduced interest income by an estimated $3 million, but improved the net interest margin. These average balances are now at what we would consider to be more normal levels.","The net interest margin was 317 basis points during the quarter, up 7 basis points from 310 basis points in the fourth quarter. The components of that change were as follows; the large decline in trust deposits held at the fed, increased reported net interest margin by an estimated 14 basis points. While LCR related investments and associated funding reduced the net interest margin by an estimated five basis points. The impact from the accelerated MBS premium amortization reduced the margin by an estimated two basis points, and we saw the usual impact from the day count in the shorter quarter, which added an estimated two basis points of the month [ph] [0:04:00] (4).","Our estimate of the compression in the core margin, excluding the items I just mentioned, was somewhat less than what we have recently seen over the past several quarters, about one to two basis points. Average loans increased by $820 million or about 5% annualized compared with the fourth quarter.","Looking at each of the portfolio of categories on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 7%, including continued strong growth in the Auto Floor Plan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans increased by about 8% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined an annualized 4% and consumer loans grew an annualized 1%, this category included growth in indirect auto loans, offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.","Average core consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Island office and CDs over $250,000, declined an annualized 21% from the fourth quarter, reflecting the decrease in trust deposits I referenced earlier.","Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income totaled $440 million in the first quarter, compared with $452 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $102 million in the first quarter, up $8 million from the prior quarter. Commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale increased about 27%, and we saw a surge in refinancing activity early in the quarter, when rates declined and the momentum continued even after rates rallied. This led to a $6 million increase in residential gain on-sale.","Several fee categories were impacted by typical seasonal factors. For example, fee income from deposit service charges provided was $102 million during the first quarter, compared with $106 million in the linked quarter. Trust fees were $124 million in the recent quarter, compared with $128 million the previous quarter, which included strong results for the institutional client services business. Similarly, credit related fees were lower by $7 million, coming off what was a strong fourth quarter. That decline largely related to fees that are typically transaction driven, and can vary somewhat from quarter-to-quarter.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude expenses from the amortization of intangible assets were $680 million, unchanged from a year ago quarter. The $21 million increase in operating expenses from $659 million in a linked quarter, reflected increased salaries and benefits, partially offset by a decline in other costs of operation. Salaries and benefits, increased by $45 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting in part, the normal seasonal increase that comes from the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement eligible employees. Higher FICA expense and certain other benefit costs, as well as an $8 million rise in pension expense that was previously disclosed in the footnote to the 2014 10-K. The seasonal factors will decline, as we enter the second quarter, but the higher pension costs should remain throughout the end of the year.","Other costs of operations were $203 million, down $28 million from a linked quarter, and down $8 million from a year ago. Elevated professional service expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014, including higher legal expenses that we noted on the January call, declined to a more normal level this past quarter and other professional services costs were reduced, as certain projects were either completed or reached significant milestones.","Overall, we were pleased that we could keep expenses flat year-over-year, while funding our initiatives and meeting our compliance related milestones. As a result, the efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization was 61.5% for the first quarter, improved from 62.8% in the year ago quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit; our credit quality remained strong, non-accrual loans declined further from the end of the fourth quarter. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans climbed by two basis points to 1.18% as of the end of the first quarter. Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $36 million compared with $32 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 22 basis points for the first quarter, up slightly from 19 basis points in the previous quarter, but still well below our long term average of 37 basis points.","Provision for credit losses was $38 million in the recent quarter, slightly exceeding net charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses was $921 million, amounting to 1.37% of total loans as of the end of March. The loan loss allowance as of March 31 was 6.3 times 2015's annualized net charge-offs.","Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at acquisitions were $237 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $194 million or 82% are guaranteed by government-related entity.","Turning to capital, the tier-1 common capital ratio is being deemphasized, as the industry moves from Basel-I to the Basel-III capital framework this year; although it will continue to be a variable in the stress testing process. But to give you a basis for comparison, M&T's tier-1 common ratio was an estimated 9.98% at the end of March, up 15 basis points from 9.83% at the end of last year. Our common equity tier-1 ratio under the current transitional Basel-III capital rules was slightly less, an estimated 9.78% at the end of the recent quarter.","Before we turn to our outlook, there are two noteworthy items announced after the end of the recent quarter. Earlier this month, we completed the divestiture of a trade processing business within the retirement services business that we acquired with Wilmington Trust. Now this business generated annual revenues of $34 million, with a minimal impact, the net income and earnings per share in 2014. From that, you should be able to estimate the quarterly impact on revenues and expenses going forward.","Last week, on April 15, we completed the redemption of $310 million of high cost fixed rate TROPs [ph], as contemplated in our capital plans. The three issues had a weighted average coupon of 8.445%.","So now turning to the outlook; as is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to revisit our thoughts from the January call regarding the full year of 2015. Although our loan growth this past quarter was slightly stronger than the 4% that we gave in our outlook, in the January earnings call, we are not going to increase our outlook at this point in time, given some of the mixed signals that we see in the economy, so we feel that we are relatively on track with the trend that you saw this quarter.","Our guidance on the net interest margin, is a little changed from our previous outlook. Although, the compression in the core margin was somewhat less than it has been in the first quarter, we still believe its reasonable to expect about three basis points of core margin pressure per quarter. If short term rates start to rise, the impact will tend to offset those pressures.","We expect modest progression in the net interest income over the coming quarters, and still expect to grow net interest income on a year-over-year basis. We still need to acquire additional high quality liquid assets to reach full compliance for the liquidity coverage ratio over the remainder of the year. Timing will be opportunistic, but we expect to be done well before the end of the year, and perhaps by the end of the third quarter.","We are still looking for low single digit growth in fee revenues, as is normally the case, we expect seasonal increases in salaries and benefits during the first quarter to reverse itself. However as I noted, the increase in pension expense will persist for the full year. We would expect the decline in the second quarter to be in the neighborhood of $30 million. And as many of you know, in its message to the shareholders in the annual report, Bob Wilmers discussed in detail, the investments that we have made in 2014, and our continuing investments in BSA\/AML, clients, capital planning, stress testing, risk management and infrastructure and client technology platforms to optimize the franchise.","While we still have more work to do, professional service expenses, incurred in connection with our BSA\/AML work are starting to trend downward, as some of the workstreams reach completion.","Over the remainder of 2015, infrastructure, data and other initiatives that we are working on, will absorb some of those savings. We do expect to see some net benefit beginning next quarter, with most of the improvement in the second half of the year. All that said, our basic outlook for expenses is unchanged. We continue to expect lower overall spending in 2015 compared to last year, and we remain focused on producing positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. The first quarter got us off to a good start.","Overall, our areas of focus for 2015 are fairly straight-forward; to continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet; manage the revenue expense dynamics to produce operating leverage; to optimize our capital structure, while conforming with both the regulatory capital thresholds, as well as the annual stress tests.","I will conclude my prepared remarks with the topic that I am sure you are all closely focused on, the merger with Hudson City Bancorp. In connection with the merger, we announced last Friday, that M&T and Hudson City have agreed to an extension of the merger agreement to October 31st, 2015. We think this will provide our regulators, sufficient time to review our merger application, which the Federal Reserve has indicated, it will be in a position to act on by September 30. No assurance can be given, as to whether or when the necessary approvals of the mergers will be received. We see no material change in the deal economics from what we have conveyed previously, and we remain strongly committed to the merger, and to our prospective partners at Hudson City.","Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions, regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which the operator will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi Matt.","Matt Burnell","Good morning Ren\u00e9. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of questions, just on the HCBK transaction. You mentioned that there is no material -- you don't believe there is a material change to the deal economics at this point. Is there any change in sort of the pace of the accretion, relative to the pace that you originally announced in 2012?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So if you go back to what we announced in 2012, I will start by saying, we are still in line with that guidance. Just straight-forward what the accretion would be, we are still in-line with that guidance. Having said that, remember what's happening with the shrinking balance sheet over time; had we done the deal earlier, the accretion probably would have been a little bit larger. But all of that is now captured in the equity of the firm, right; so that's how the economics are sort of held intact, and don't change the deal.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And does the delay, relative to what you thought the timing was going to be, when you submitted your CCAR at the beginning of this year. Does that have any effect on the potential timing of the buybacks that you are scheduled to do in early 2016?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","In our governance process, when we looked at those levels of buyback, we didn't assume anything about whether or not we would have to deal; we sort of just looked at what M&T on its own could handle, as sort of a first step of returning to buyback.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And just finally for me, any change in the tax rate, given the new accounting treatment going forward?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. There is no change to the tax rate. But what I'd urge you to do, is take a look at the quarterly trend, because all those are restated. So the number might be higher than what's in your models, but the tax rate is going to be consistent, with what you're seeing across the quarters there in the press release [ph] [0:02:56] (7).","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning Ren\u00e9, good morning Don. So just wanted to follow-up on the question on the guidance related to the merger and the NII. So Ren\u00e9, you talked about typical three basis points of quarterly compression and NIM. It looks like the HQLA was added late in the quarter, and had a five basis point impact. So is that three basis points not including the impact of those HQLA purchases into the second quarter? Maybe give us a little extra color around what the HQLA impact could have on 2Q's NIM?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. That two, three basis points is, is without the HQLA, and if you think about what happened in the first quarter, we went out and did a $1.5 billion issuance of debt. And in fact, we did 5s and 10s, which is sort of the first time we did that, because we thought that the spread between treasuries and net debt were at historic lows, I think 47 basis points for the 10. So we took the opportunity to go out and grab some of that efficiency to length out the maturity structure of the debt. So there was a bit of an extra cost this quarter than you would normally see.","My thinking is that, our thought is that we might be quite a bit lighter in the second quarter, and then finish up in the second half of the year. So second quarter, I don't expect a similar impact, and third quarter, will depend a little bit about on what we do with the term structure, instead of what's available at that time.","So I think going forward for the remainder of the three quarters, I don't think there is a big material effect from finishing up what we have to do on the dollar amount of NII.","Brian Klock","Okay. So guess just on the NIM, the percentage NIM -- now the five basis point impact in the first quarter, there was about a third of an impact it seems on average balances. Should we think that there is another 10 basis points that come out of the NIM in the second quarter, or the full impact of what you did in the first?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","There might be some impact, but I don't see much of an impact.","Brian Klock","Okay. And again, the three basis points doesn't include the benefit from the TROP [ph] reduction either then?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, it does not.","Brian Klock","Right okay. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning. Ren\u00e9, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the trajectory of other expenses, and your comments about having lower expenses in 2015 versus 2014? Can you help us understand, how this mix shift happens from the professional consulting fees into the core and how much netting down you think that could have, especially on that other expense line?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I think I know what you mean, but just to be clear, in terms of where we were at the end of last year, we had built up our infrastructure to have all of our permanent resources in place, a lot of which were in salaries and benefits, but we still had running the full content of the professional services, and temporary staffing that helped us get accelerate the pace of the work. And so as we reach our milestones, that will come down, and it will produce lower expenses and -- from where we are now, and also on a year-over-year basis point, as you look at each quarter. But we don't think that you will see the full benefit of that, because we need to continue to make some investments, particularly on the technology side that we like to do.","So I think the way to think about it is, we are going to try to shoot for positive operating leverage every quarter this year, and that -- go ahead?","Ken Usdin","I just wanted to say, on a year-over-year basis positive operating leverage?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. And I am thinking about it, I am looking at every quarter; and that's why I said, I feel good about the fact that we started off positively in the first quarter, and if we can continue to do that by utilizing some of the lower professional services, I think we feel pretty good about it.","Ken Usdin","Okay. My second question is just about the Trust business; it has been kind of moving along at a low single digit rate of growth. And I am just wondering, what's that growth rate being burdened by, and at what point do you think we can start to see an acceleration in the Trust income growth line item?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think this year-over-year, we are looking at 2% in the past year, since we did the merger, we have been running at about five. And if you look at the two most important business that underlie that, that's the Institutional Client services and the Wealth businesses, those are still growing at about that pace. We still have investments in some of the affiliated managers, and as you know, with sort of the market performance on active managers that you're seeing across the industry, those balances and fees are down. But the two core businesses are still doing very-very well. So I would expect, if we could get 3% to 5% growth every year in that business, I think that's a real plus, because we are cross-selling that into the existing customer base, and then we have to do that -- we have to work on our efficiency and our ability to deliver that -- those services in a more streamlined fashion. If we can do that, that would be a homerun for the economics around those business.","Ken Usdin","And just a quick one on the end there, do you know the amount of quarterly fee waivers that you're waiving in that business?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. Fee waivers in the money funds -- Ken, we had sorted --","Don MacLeod","Ken, we had previously disclosed 15 to 20 a quarter, but I need to get that updated and we will have to get back to you.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe touch on loan growth; I know you pointed out, the first quarter was a bit ahead of what you all had guided for, but you didn't feel comfortable enough to take up the full year outlook. What sort of drove the strength this quarter relative to expectations and what gives you caution on a look forward basis?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I mean I think, you saw from the comments Bob, that we had pretty decent growth in C&I and real estate, consumer was slower; and then geographically, we still continue to see very nice growth at 5% growth annualized in upstate Western New York. And then New York, Philadelphia, New Jersey, that was 8% annualized. Baltimore, which has been running negative for several quarters, was up 2%. So it's sort of across the board with strength in New York, I guess is what I would say.","And why we are so concerned with it though, in terms of thinking that we'd be higher, because we really have seen a lot of competitive pressure. Mostly, we believe, because of the substantial market liquidity and the number of participants that are actually out there, lending or competing for the same strong credit. So we have got banks, we have got insurance companies, CMBS originations have peaked, and we also now have PE firms. And what we are seeing, is that we are starting to routinely see sub-200 over cost of funds over LIBOR deals. A number of them are now situated around 150 basis points, on the 150 basis point range. And we are also seeing -- loosening deal structures. So the way we think about that is, when you start seeing terms that get extended so that deal terms are that low in pricing and -- I am sorry, the pricing is low and the deal terms are seven to 10 years, the economics are in the mid-single digits on tangible capital.","And so, the idea that you can ramp up growth and actually produce any economic results, it doesn't seem to make much sense in this competitive environment. So that would keep us somewhat subdued. I think, to the extent that you see somebody have significant loan growth, I think you'd have to question the structure and the pricing of the deals.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. That's helpful. Then one other question sort of shifting gears, the mortgage line obviously very strong; what is the split there of service and versus origination income this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I can give you that, I may shuffle around a little bit to do it. So $68 million in servicing would be outstanding, and then the residential gain on sale was around $21 million. I think you may figure out the rest from that, the rest would be commercial.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And where the pipelines in that business is looking like heading into the second quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Pipelines look pretty strong. I think, if I look at the mortgage funds line, which is sort of application that we received during the quarter, minus those that denied or withdrawn or for loans closed, that was up high. That was up 50%. So to give you some sense, the pipeline at the end of the quarter, was $869 million, where the last time it was about that high was second quarter 2014.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Hello. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just following real quickly on the mortgage question there; you guys had previously talked about expecting mortgage revenues to be down for the year, after the strong 1Q and kind of the strong pipeline. Should we think about maybe having potentially, [0:33:41], the upside there?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I feel good about the first quarter, its in the bag. The momentum in the second is great, but mortgage is all about rates. So it really depends what happens with the rate environment.","David Eads","Okay. That makes sense. I guess, maybe on -- when it comes to mortgage loans on the balance sheet, that dipped after a couple of quarters of being kind of stable. Was that -- was it just more due to seasonal factors, or anything else?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","You mean the residential mortgage book that we have?","David Eads","Yeah, on the balance sheet.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. Well the balance sheet, I think that's -- I wouldn't characterize that as sort of normal run-off in the held-to-maturity portfolio. And it wouldn't make much sense for us to be adding mortgages pending the Hudson City thing, where you'd be bringing on $20 billion plus of mortgages. So that's just sort of naturally -- natural run-off that you see there.","David Eads","Okay. It just seemed that number would stabilize a little bit over the last couple of quarters, but that makes sense. Then just a last one for me, you talked about cash balances stabilize here, should we sort of think about this level of cash balances as a good run-rate for the near term, rather than kind of investing any of that in securities or elsewhere?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We think that's right. I think for now, we are thinking about that as separate businesses, because those cash balances are high, but they tend not to be individual -- individual transactions aren't around for long periods of time, right? So I think the level that we'd see today is what we kind of expect, and I don't think we have any plans to really use a lot of that for the LCR.","David Eads","All right. Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions; the first one was in terms of C&I growth Ren\u00e9; you talked a little bit about your growth relative to others and some of the competition in the industry. But I was curious, if you could just help us delve a little deeper into where exactly your growth is coming from now, within C&I, relative to maybe where you had seen growth, say 12 months or so ago. So basically I am asking, if the mix of where you're generating C&I loan growth has changed any, relative to what you had seen say a year ago?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't think so. I mean, I am just -- I will do a bit of a scan. For a long period of time, the C&I growth was sort of strongest in Upstate New York and in New York City and Philadelphia. Fairly strong in PA, and weaker in Baltimore and Washington; that still holds true. I think its pretty consistent with what we have seen over time.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And --","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We just don't know, [ph] what's going on in those economies.","Sameer Gokhale","But is there anything, any underlying loan category specifically within C&I that's growing more any -- if you have comments in terms of geography, as far as specific loan categories that you can think of, where they might be more pronounced sort of mix shift?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. You remember each of the markets are different. So there has been -- now you've got me out of the C&I category in a sense, but if I just think of the markets overall; in Buffalo, there is a lot of construction going on, and the number of hotels that have been put up and that could be transitioned into permanent financing, versus in Washington DC, one of the reasons why we think things are so slow, is because the economy there around the government services seems to be relatively weak, in terms of job growth. So we are seeing -- in Washington, we are seeing a slowdown in job growth, we are seeing tepid office space demand, especially in the general services, administration and defense contractors.","So we have got a fair bit of a diversity, so it depends on which market you're in, so there maybe themes in markets, but there is no big theme overall.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then you know, there was one other bank that reported on Friday; they, I think have a significantly higher amount of exposure to the energy sector, and yet, they were talking about how they had reduced commitments. But it seemed like at the same time, those same borrowers were able to get funding elsewhere in the capital markets. So while they were de-risking, it seems like somebody else in the capital markets is willing to take on that risk.","Now in terms of your customer base and your sort of tight underwriting through cycles, it seems like your customer base would be even more receptive and able to get funding in the capital markets. So when I listen to your commentary about C&I loan growth and loan growth overall, shouldn't we expect in this sort of environment, that you see a more pronounced slowdown, relative to maybe what your peers are seeing from that perspective. Just more competition, more loans going away funded by the capital markets relative to your peers?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","You should. I mean, I think -- first, let me start off by saying, I think we talked about this last time. We don't have very much exposure to the energy sector at all. So we don't -- we have some, but its secondary, as you think about shale and things like that. And people for example, trucking companies supplying water to those facilities. So its very limited.","But having said that, one of the things you're seeing, whether it'd be unhealthy deals or on things coming out of the classified portfolio, there is plenty of people to take those deals out. And I will give you an example, I mean, one of the things, as I go through all the deals, I look -- one of them in New York state, where we lost a particular deal. It was a $30 million credit. It was a 10-year fixed rate pricing of 2.14%. We just did the $750 million of 10-year fixed, at 2.90%, which is not possible for us to make that loan. So you start wonder, where is that going? Is that going to the capital markets, right in our people stretching in those venues. So this is one of the things that makes us very increasingly cautious, as we kind of move forward.","Most of our credits, for example, the majority of the lending is being done with the existing customers that are out there.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. Thank you. And then just my last question was -- I am just trying to get a sense for, in this current environment, what leverage you can pull from a revenue growth standpoint? I mean, clearly, looking at new products, etcetera, would be one place where you might try to drive additional revenue growth incrementally. But if you look at the penetration of your commercial lending customer base, and if you look at cash management or other types of services you could offer those customers, do you feel that there is more room there, where you can improve penetration? Or at this point, do you feel like you are at a level, where there are limited opportunities for you to sell additional products to that specific customer base?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think that, as you focus on, particularly folks on the commercial space, I think we are very fortunate. So well yes, I think there is probably more that we could do in certain parts of the commercial segment around cash management and different types of cash management services. I also think, that will light in a number of other areas that we do. So relative to our peers, we are probably light on the insurance side. There is a number of areas. And then don't forget, that we have got a big part of what the wealth business in Wilmington is, its serving businesses. And that has actually provided tremendous -- I hate to use the word -- you used the word cross-sell. It has provided tremendous capabilities for us to supplement sort of a natural life-cycle of those business owners. And so that's going pretty well.","So I feel kind of fortunate. We have got areas where we know we could improve and we have some that we actually are improving. And so I think that will be our focus. I will just say it, I know we are off with some folks expectations for the quarter in terms of revenue, but at the end of the day, I was pretty impressed that we had growth in revenue year-over-year at 2%, and we are not seeing much of that. And I think, I talked in my comments about efficiency, and one of the places where you have to look at efficiencies, is to look at efficiency of your balance sheet. And if we do that, and we continue to look for opportunities there, then that will have a positive impact on revenue, like the TROP [ph] redemptions we just did. So those types of things are going to be really important to us.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. My first question is just a follow-up to Brian's question on HQLA. Ren\u00e9, could you give us a sense of what you think the end of period balances would be in your investment securities portfolio? And also, what you're going to be funding that growth with for the duration of the year?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","What they are now, the end of period?","Erika Najarian","What you expect the securities balances to be by the end of the year, taking into account the HQLA purchases that you're going to be embark upon, and what you're going to fund that incremental purchases with?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We are somewhere around $14 billion. I think we have got to do a little more than what we did recently. In the last quarter we did $1.8 billion. So we have a little bit more than that to do, to get ourselves [indiscernible].","And remember, I think we are being relatively conservative there. So as someone mentioned, are we using the $5 billion in cash, that counts in liquidity coverage ratio, but we are not using it. So we are probably technically further along, and have some leeway from there, but we tend not to count those assets, as we manage them internally.","Erika Najarian","And is that $1.8 billion more than the $1.8 billion for the rest of the year, or is that more than $1.8 billion quarter-to-quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","More than $1.8 billion for the rest of the year. The pure [ph] median, we are at 16% of our securities or 16% of our balance sheet and the peers are at about 19%.","Erika Najarian","Okay. And then just one last quarter if you could, if the deal with Hudson City does close or gets floated on, on October 31. Is fourth quarter -- end of fourth quarter, too soon of a close to assume just for our modeling purposes?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We have been trying to get the deal done for a very long time, and should we get approval, we will work very swiftly.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Hey, I just wanted to ask about the cross-sell efforts down in New Jersey, and twofold; one is, kind of how much in run rate expenses are already there, because that wasn't netted out against your synergies in the original deal, when its already in the expenses. And then two, what kind of revenue have you been able to see, with your efforts so far, as you have got that fully operational now?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","You know Marty, I think things are on track, maybe a little better than we would have expected, when we first laid out our plan. We have got over $1 billion -- we may have put these notes in our -- the best place to look, [ph] it involves letter, I think we did a paragraph on it. So one of the keys is, that we have over $1 billion of loans to-date, that we seem to be engaged in all fronts, except those where we really can't, because we -- also in retail, we don't have any engagement. So we feel pretty good. That seems to be on track as we thought [0:46:32]. And I think, for the level of activity that we have going on today, in those non-branch business lines, I'd say we probably are fully staffed from the level of activity that we have today, and to see more hires, we would have to see more growth in a bigger portfolio.","Marty Mosby","And just curious, how much you were netting out of the original expense synergies that you have already incurred?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't know if I have ever disclosed it, but quite frankly, I can't remember. You know the number we hired, right? I think we talked about, on the ground we have 129 people there, so you can do something there. But in totality, I think when you count people back here at M&T, it was more like 170 people that we hired, and so you can get some sense of what the cost of that would be on an annual basis, if you throw in a little bit of extra occupancy and so forth.","Marty Mosby","And then, just one last follow-up, if you look at the seasonality -- you have seasonality in really big buckets, you had fewer days, $10 million, you mentioned on NII, and you got fees, which if you look at mortgage, kind of already starting to kick in, maybe you saw from that. But that's generally about $30 million, and then you highlighted another $30 million on expenses. Typically, you have a little bit more than the rest of the regional banks and the seasonality. Is there anything that would soften that, if you kind of look in total, about $75 million from first quarter to second quarter in normal progression?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I am glad you mentioned that. So a year ago, from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014, I think in total, we saw revenues decline about $36 million. This time, we saw them drop about $33 million. So pretty much, while it may be some different categories here and there, there is nothing that's atypical about the seasonality that we are seeing, and everybody's well familiar with what happens on the expense side. So again, that's why I spent a lot of time focusing on the year-over-year space, because for us to do all the things that we have been doing and actually produce 6% growth in net income, I felt pretty good about it. And if we can keep doing that, and we can keep producing operating leverage, I think that's pretty good. I think what we are going to have to begin to do, as we get into the next year, is start working on capital efficiency and those things, as our capital ratios have -- we have passed two stress tests, and our capital ratios continue to rise, and so I think it\u2019s a good time to begin to think about what our capital structure is, and how we rationalize that as well.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. You guys mentioned that you have seasonality in the trust business, but it doesn\u2019t seem like a business that should have seasonality. Can you just remind us, why that's a seasonal level of revenue?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. Two reasons off the top of my head, one is, we get paid in different ways, sometimes we get paid on a monthly basis, some fee arrangements are quarterly. But there is also a significant portion, where we are on an annual fee basis. So you would see that at the end of the year, and then as you get back up, you lose that source. So that whole collection of people that pay you on an annual basis, you wouldn't see in the first quarter.","And then taxes, so for example, you should see an uptick in the revenue next time, because all of -- the substantial portion of our tax fees are paid in the second quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. That means fourth quarter is higher, given the annual payment, and sorry, your comments mean that fourth quarter was lower or second quarter is higher than first?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","First quarter would be lower than the fourth or the annual fee reason.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. And then second quarter is higher than the first, because of taxes?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Because of taxes? So there is some of it -- as we go back, its pretty consistent. I think at year ago, if we do the same thing -- a year ago, fourth to first, we were down $4.7 million. This time we were down $4.6 million.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jill Shea with Credit Suisse.","Jill Glaser Shea","Hi. Good morning. So with the merger close date extended to October 31st, could you note for us any potential differences in certain expense line items, relative to your initial estimates for a potential April 30th close? And so, to just keep some expense line items higher over the near term, and then does this factor into your thought process in terms of timing of additional investments in the business, in order to manage just the [indiscernible] year-over-year?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. So all my comments about the financials to-date have been M&T standalone, and all the comments that we make about Hudson city, think of it as time zero out 12 months of the first year. So there is nothing we can do, until we all bring those franchise together and start working on it. So the start date, both of when we pay for the franchise, and both when we get to operate and it just moves. But I think that's the best way to answer your question, am I getting that right?","Jill Glaser Shea","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Question on your common equity tier-1 ratio that you pointed out at the end of March is 9.78% under the transitional capital rules. Do you have an estimate for what that ratio would be at the end of March, if you had to fully implement the rules applied?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes I do. It's just slightly less, its 9.71.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. You've touched on more than once on this call, on having to focus on optimizing your capital levels, especially after the Hudson City deal closes this year. Where do you see optimal common equity tier-1 ratio from your guys eyes? Where do you think that could settle out at, every couple years, let's say one everything settles then?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So we have sort of been searching for that, right. So a year ago, two stress tests ago, we entered the stress test with a tier-1 common of 9.48 and we fared pretty well in the stress test. And we entered with something like 9.76 or something like that this past time, and we fared pretty well. So now that we have had our internal models for some time, but we are getting to -- get a chance to see the third party's view of that. So we are kind of zoning in on that, and I think that sort of starts to frame the idea of where our target ratios might come out, and what I know, that to be on a comparable basis, you have to use the other measure, which is 9.98. So clearly, as we start pushing up above 10, you're starting to get into the space of excess capital.","So at some point, we will probably start disclosing target capital ratios. But again, I think, we haven't really done that in particular, because of the sort of uncertainty with the transaction, because that transaction will give us even more capital, all right, and we need to sort of think about what the difference is between our target ratios, and what we practically can and actually get to.","So that's sort of what our thinking is, but hopefully that frames for you, what we are zoning or beginning to zone in on.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And coming back to your comments about the loan portfolio; we have heard from a number of banks this quarter about the pressure on spreads due to increased competition. You're one of the few that have talked about maybe underwriting standards now, are starting to weaken if you will? Is this relatively new, the spread pressures seem to have been talked about a quarter or two before from others as well? But the weakening of underwriting [indiscernible], is that something new that you guys are seeing, or am I being too harsh in saying that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, you're not being too harsh in saying that. I think what I'd characterize is, it has been slightly increasing for a long period of time, and that sort of increasing trend has not cone unabated. So when we look at our own numbers, I look at some of the things that in for a long term client, that we are doing for them. And I say to myself, wow, we are now getting into a space where, if you're going to see any kind of loan growth, you're probably -- it would be tough to generate high single digit loan growth in this environment, when you compete with the capital markets. I would expect, in the real estate space, the multifamily space, the CMBS issuance will be up 20% this year. So that's pretty natural for us not to be able to compete with those guys, in the level of both structure and price.","Gerard Cassidy","Do you think it will be more challenging for M&T in this environment? In the past, you guys have done a very good job in managing capital, and when markets became aggressive in underwriting, your numbers would show that you would pull back, have better credit growing through the down cycle. But then, take that excess capital that you weren't using, and you weren't the best at giving it back to shareholders. Now that you have this new regulatory control on returning capital, could it be more challenging for M&T going forward, if you decide to pull back; because the underwriting is way too aggressive, but you are in it now, and you may have to sit on the capital longer?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It\u2019s a great question Gerard. I hope not. I mean, we have got a large organization with lots of people. And so, we have a strong culture of not chasing revenue, and I think that culture is still intact. And at the same time, we are investing very heavily in sort of modernizing our risk management infrastructure, and make sure that doesn't happen. All we can do is, continue to talk about it and be very transparent about it.","Having said that, when I look back at the cycles, I think -- this is just me, but I think that, when we look back, we will be talking about how -- when a lot of the standards were weakening and deal economics were lighter, we were making investments in our risk management infrastructure and we were focused on efficiency. And that's sort been this way, the cycle has been -- has carried out over a number of decades for us, and I think as long as we have that good work to do, it makes us less antique [ph] about the fact that revenue growth is slow, and our clients need to be very loyal to us, and our focus will be on maintaining those relationships, and making sure that we take some of the excess capital invested in our franchise, in our infrastructure.","Gerard Cassidy","My last question -- last one is, obviously it has been a tough go with this Hudson City acquisition. After it is completed, has your view or Bob's view or the board's view on acquisitions in the future changed because of what you had to go through in this process with HCBK?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I will try to answer that question if you promise to ask me again, what's the deal?","Gerard Cassidy","Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think the way I think about it is, this might be the largest transaction since Dodd-Frank. There is a lot of uncertainty out there, but clearly the standards are high. And I feel good about the fact, while it may seem counterintuitive that we are in there, working on finding out first-hand what those standards are. And I think that, as we get to a place, our investments should be leverageable; and I never heard anything to suggest that the regulatory environment doesn't want deals to happen ever again. So I try to be somewhat optimistic.","Having said that, I will tell you, that clearly the standards are high, and I look at all the work that we have done, and the way I think about it is, we have done a tremendous amount of work. I won't recite it all, but we have done a tremendous amount of work, in a relatively short period of time, and it kind of makes sense, that the Federal Reserve, would want to take an appropriate amount of time in this environment, to sort of -- to sort of get their arms around those improvements we have made, to get comfortable with it, as part of the application process. I try not to think too much beyond that, but I don't see any reason why -- with the infrastructure we have in place, that we shouldn't be able to do deals in the future.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you for all your time.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question is coming from Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning. Ren\u00e9, I think in the past you have talked about a 50% to 55% efficiency ratio of getting back to that level over time. Assuming Hudson City closes, is that a range you think you can get to in the current revenue environment, or do you foresee needing some help from rates to get there?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think you -- there are cycles, and I think that revenues are very-very depressed, because of the rate environment. So you see how asset sensitive we are, its significant and you also have -- Don touched on the fact that on the mutual fund space, where we have $9 million to $10 million of mutual funds that are earning zero to negative, those would gain back -- go all the way back up to 40. So this is -- we think of it, in terms of the revenue and expense spread, I think that clearly, you could get to those levels with a different rate environments, and not being where it is today.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. So those levels ensure of a more normalized environment then, is that a fair statement?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think so. But can you make improvements in the current environment? Yeah, we definitely have the ability to do that, because we have been spending a lot of money. And if you look at the peers, they have been reducing expenses, we had not -- over the last two years, we have increased expenses, and there is a big spread between what we have invested in the period. So we have opportunity to improve without a turnaround in rate.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. And then just finally on modeling, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. In terms of the accounting change, given the effective tax rate in the quarter, that's a decent run rate going forward, just using that tax rate from 1Q?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. 36-ish somewhere in that range is what you see there is probably pretty good.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Don MacLeod for any final closing remarks.","Don MacLeod","Again, thank you all for participating today. And as always, if clarification of any of the items on the call or news release is necessary, please contact our Investor Relations Department at area code 716-842-5138. Thank you and good bye.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call.

And welcome to the M&T Bank Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Laurie and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call may contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's earnings press release, M&T's results for the fourth quarter reflect a solid rebound in net interest income.","Changes to the balance sheet which include the reinvestment of cash previously held at the Fed into investment securities over $1.2 billion of growth in average loans, success in repricing Hudson City, book of time deposits and a modest tailwind from interest rates all contributed to an $18 million increase in taxable equivalent net interest income. Expenses remained well controlled and credit continued to perform well versus our long term average.","I\u2019ll share some details on how each of these actions impacted us in a few moments. However, before we proceed, I\u2019d like acknowledge the contributions of Patrick Hodgson a member of M&T\u2019s Board of Directors who passed away suddenly over the holidays. Mr. Hodgson was one of our longest serving directors having joined the M&T Board in 1984. He helped to guide the growth of M&T from what was a local back in Buffalo to the $120 billion super regional bank that we are today. We will miss his counsel and his friendship.","Now let\u2019s turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $2.10 in the third quarter of 2016 and a $1.65 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Net income for the quarter was $331 million compared with $350 million in the linked quarter and up 22% from $271 million in the year-ago quarter.","Include in the fourth quarter\u2019s results was a $2 million gain from a sale of a CDO which represented the last such security we held which would require divestiture under the so called Volcker Rule. When combined with the $28 million of gains realized from a similar Volcker Rule related divestiture in the third quarter, total securities gains for the past two quarters were $30 million, which amounted to $18 million after tax effect or $0.12 per diluted common share.","In the fourth quarter, we contributed a like amount $30 million to The M&T Charitable Foundation, which also equaled $18 million after tax effect and $0.12 per common share.","There were no merger related expenses in either third or fourth quarter of 2016, however results for the fourth quarter of 2015 included merger related charges amounting to $61 million after tax effect or $0.40 per common share.","Also included in GAAP results were after tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter unchanged from the prior quarter.","In system with our long term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.","M&T\u2019s net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization and merger related expenses from the relevant periods was $336 million compared with $356 million in the linked quarter and $338 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.01 for the recent quarter compared with $2.13 in 2016\u2019s third quarter and $2.09 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","On a GAAP basis, M&T\u2019s fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.05% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.13%. This compares with rates of 1.12% and 8.68% respectively in the previous quarter.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder\u2019s equity of 1.1% and 11.93% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.77% in the third quarter of 2016.","In accordance with the SEC\u2019s guidelines, this morning\u2019s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Turing to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $883 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $18 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin improved to 3.08%, up 3 basis points from 3.05% in the linked quarter.","Average balances of funds placed on deposit with the Fed declined by nearly $900 million from the third quarter. Those funds were reinvested resulting in $1 billion higher level of average investment securities. We estimate that this exchange benefited the margin by approximately 2 basis points.","The benefit to the margin from the Fed\u2019s December action to raise the Fed funds target and the rate paid on excess reserves was about 2 basis points. This benefit was offset largely by core margin pressures. The net result was at the yield on loans was unchanged from the third quarter.","We also saw the impact from an improved deposit mix as higher cost time deposits declined and were replaced by lower cost saving deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. We estimate this added about 1 basis point to the margin.","We\u2019ll provide our outlook in a few moments, but I\u2019ll note particularly that the benefit from the Fed\u2019s rate action was only in play for a part of the quarter and we expect further benefit from a full quarter\u2019s impact.","Average loans increased by about 6% annualized or $1.2 billion compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were up approximately 8% annualized led by the usual seasonal rebound in floorplan balances.","Commercial real estate loans increased by about 20% annualized. This includes a higher than normal level of loans held for sale by our commercial mortgage banking group. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 16% annualized rate.","Consumer loans grew an annualized 6% with growth in indirect loans including auto continuing to be offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.","Regionally, we\u2019ve seen loan growth evenly spread across most of our footprint with the only out layers being greater New York City and New Jersey which have been consistently stronger all year.","Average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at M&T\u2019s Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 increased by $1 billion from the third quarter with higher levels of trust demand and savings deposits partially offset by a faster pace of runoff in time deposits.","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $465 million in the fourth quarter compared with $491 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, non-interest revenues grew slightly from the linked quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues were $99 million in the recent quarter compared with $104 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $760 million in the recent quarter, down about 9% compared with the third quarter.","Total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were $63 million compared with $67 million in the prior quarter.","Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter, down only slightly from the record breaking volumes we saw in the third quarter\u2019s results. Commercial banking revenues were $36 million compared with $37 million in the third quarter.","Trust income was $122 million in the recent quarter compared with $119 million in the previous quarter.","As I noted last time, on our last call, new business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business. Service charges on deposit accounts were $105 million compared with $108 in the third quarter.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets were $760 million. Expenses were well controlled in the fourth quarter.","The efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator was 56.4% in the recent quarter. The ratio was 55.9% in the previous quarter and 55.5% in 2015\u2019s fourth quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains relatively stable. Nonaccrual loans increased by $83 million to $920 million at December 31st. And the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 1.01% compared with 0.93% at the end of the third quarter.","Residential mortgage loans acquired with Hudson City accounted for approximately half of the increase, while one large commercial credit to an environmental remediation and disaster response company substantially accounted for the remainder of the increase.","Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $49 million compared with $41 million in the third quarter. Reflected in the recent quarter\u2019s charge-offs was $12 million associated with the commercial loan to a supplier to the metals industry. Recall that the third quarter\u2019s results included a similarly large charge-off on a loan to a commercial maintenance company.","Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 22 basis points for the fourth quarter. Just slightly an excess of what we\u2019ve seen on average over the past two years. The provision for credit losses was $62 million in the recent quarter exceeded net charge-offs by $13 million reflecting overall loan growth as well as the continued shift to higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City residential mortgage portfolio pays down.","The allowance for credit losses was $989 million at the end of December. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.09% unchanged from the end of the third quarter.","Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value discount on acquisition were $301 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $283 million or 94% are guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.96% compared with 10.78% at the end of the third quarter which reflects earnings retention during the fourth quarter as well as the impact of the net decline in end of period assets.","M&T repurchased a modest amount of common stock during the quarter preferring to avoid the volatility in the market through the election and its aftermath.","Next, I\u2019d like to talk a moment to cover the key highlights of 2016\u2019s full year results. GAAP based diluted earnings per common share were $7.78, up 8% from $7.18 in 2015. Net income was $1.32 billion improved from $1.08 billion in the prior year. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.06% and 8.16% respectively.","Net operating income which excludes intangible amortization and the merger related expenses was $1.36 billion improved from $1.16 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating income per common share was $8.08, up 4% from $7.74 in 2015.","Net operating income for 2016 expresses as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder\u2019s equity was 1.14% and 12.25% respectively.","Now turning to the outlook. As we look forward into 2017, there is reason for optimism particularly with respect to the outlook for interest, interest rates, but also including further improvement in the economy and the potential for regulatory reform.","However, we entered 2016 an optimistic frame of mind and we\u2019re reminded that the market and the electric don\u2019t always follow the expected script. But today based on what we know will offer our thoughts.","Loans at the end of 2016 grew just under 4% from the end of the prior year. This reflected relatively strong 11.5% growth in our commercial loan portfolios and consumer loans partially offset by a 14% plan decline in residential mortgage loans, predominantly those acquired with Hudson City.","For 2017 even how rates have moved, we are looking for similar net loan growth likely in the mid-single-digit range. We expect that will be driven by somewhat slower growth in commercial and consumer loans than we saw in 2016 combined with a slower pace of runoff in residential mortgage loans.","As was the case at this time last year, our outlook for net interest margin is dependent on further actions by the Federal Reserve. A flat rate scenario should still lead to some expansion of the margin as the benefit from last month\u2019s Fed action becomes fully embedded in the run rate offsetting core margin pressures. One or two further actions by the Fed in 2017 will potentially offer additional upside.","That outlook excludes the potential impact from cash balances brought in through Wilmington Trust, which could have an impact on the reported margin but would have a marginal effect on revenue. The level of cash at the Fed was quite low at year-end and we would expect somewhat of a rebound looking forward. In any case we're looking for year-over-year growth in net interest income.","The higher interest rate environment will likely challenge mortgage banking in 2017, specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations. As we've noted previously, we have the capacity and appetite for additional servicing or sub servicing business shouldn\u2019t any opportunities present themselves, this could offer a potential offset to slow originations.","The outlook for our other fee businesses remained stable with the growth in low to mid-single digit range. We expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2017 compared to last year. We continue our focus on generating positive operating leverage for the year further rate actions by the Fed would likely make that go easier.","I'll remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in the first quarter 2017 which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as the handful of other items. Last year that increase was approximately $42 million.","Our outlook for credit remains little changed. There are some modest pressures on non-performing and criticize loans, but our outlook for credit losses remains relatively stable. Net charge-offs amounted to just 18 basis points last year following 19 basis points in both 2014 and 2015, all of which were roughly half of our long term average of 36 basis points. But as we said on this call last year and the year before our conservatism won't let us count on being net figure in 2017.","As to capital, we expect to work toward completion of our 2016 CCAR capital plan by the end of the CCAR fiscal year in June.","Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfold in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Laurie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning.","Frank Schiraldi","Darren, just a couple of questions, first I want to make sure, I think in the right way about the buyback going forward. So obviously you noted there was a pullback after the election, the volatility in the stock price. But it sounds like you're still indicating that you're expecting to get near or to what was authorized by or approved through CCAR, is that the case now that the stock kind of stabilized at these levels?","Darren King","That's right. When we saw the volatility that kind of gave us pause for the moment in many respects not dissimilar to how we thought about our securities repurchases post-Brexit where we kind of step to the side and waited for things to kind of normalize and stabilize, now that we've had a chance to see where things have shaken out. We feel good about where things are and plan to resume our distributions through 2016 and plan to distribute all of our allotment between now and the end of June.","Frank Schiraldi","Great. Okay. And then just secondly on the margin, I believe last quarter you\u2019ve noted that a good expectation once the 25 basis points from December was fully flowed through the NIM was for six to 10 bps of expansion, is that still a reasonable assessment and would that be a reasonable assessment for another 25 basis points that we could get at some point during the year?","Darren King","So, on the first hike that happened, I think 6 to 10 is still a good target range for the full year. Also looking at the full year 2015 or 2016 sorry versus full year 2017, 6 to 10 is a good target probably towards the higher end of that range as we look based on what we've seen so far. It\u2019s probably a good starting point for another increase obviously the biggest [Technical Difficulty]","Frank Schiraldi","[Technical Difficulty] $45 million of increase seasonality and we also take out the $30 million charitable contribution, is it fair to sort of all else equal expect expenses to be up $10 million to $15 million next quarter?","Darren King","I think that math works, yeah, in that range.","Frank Schiraldi","Got it, perfect. Last question about, just curious your comment on thoughts around acquisitions as a capital deployment tool sort of what the appetite is now here is for in Hudson City as you are and if it is something of interest where you would be interested?","Darren King","Acquisitions as you're well aware have always been an important component of our growth strategy combining acquisition with organic growth where we would like to be back in the game, but we've got to finish off our work to deal with our written agreement. When we think about the geographies and generally, we've been interested in things that are within our contiguous to where we do business. We think that those are the best places for us to be, because it leverages our brand and our management capacity that going far afield doesn't really is harder to execute.","But you know the other question obviously is prices and where our prices are right now and multiples are known if you tend to look at when we've been more aggressive and, aggress is probably not the right word, but more active it\u2019s when things have gotten little bit bad. So we're still in the best part of the credit cycle, but that is traditionally not been when we've been active, but we\u2019re open to it. We're hoping to get back to it. We\u2019ll just see whether 2017 is that year.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay, fair enough. You mentioned things that are in market are contiguous, is there any preference within the footprint there are upstate or the New York markets you've been added to or mid-Atlantic or elsewhere?","Darren King","We don't tend to think about that way. We tend to be more on the side and watching what's happening and you know we have an idea of which franchises we think are well run and would be good fits with us. And then from there we\u2019re more opportunistic based on what kind of presents itself.","Frank Schiraldi","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning, Darren and Don.","Darren King","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","So, Darren on the NIM, I just want to follow-up with the few questions. So it doesn't look like there is any additional accretable yield that would've gone through the fourth quarter versus the third?","Darren King","Maybe a small amount that came in, but nothing that would materially drive the NIM\u2026","Brian Klock","Okay and then on the\u2026.","Darren King","\u2026towards the end of that.","Brian Klock","So is there any sort of headwind going into 2017 with your guidance for NII from this lower accretable yield that is not material enough to impact the numbers.","Darren King","I don't think is material enough to impact the numbers compared to the guidance that we gave and where the NIM will be and we've taken all that stuff into account.","Brian Klock","Okay, and then so on deposit side, so you mentioned some of the benefit coming through on line more and you can see that on the C&I yields that there are up three basis points, but on the time deposit side for a basis point reduction in costs there is so, is there any more benefit coming from the repricing on the Hudson City time deposits?","Darren King","We think there's still some juice left there. It's interesting when you look at our numbers which I'm sure you have from second quarter to third quarter there wasn't much of an impact and it took you know a quarter\u2019s worth of work to make that change happen and start to see it in the reflect itself in the numbers. We think there's still some movement there. The repricing continues and the turn of that book continues. I guess I would expect another quarter similar perhaps to what we saw in between Q3 and Q4 repeat itself between Q4 and Q1 then we should start to slow down because a lot of that book is also going into shorter rate structures.","Brian Klock","Gotcha. So if we think about the 6 to 10 guidance of getting the benefit into the first quarter from the - 2017 from the benefit of the December hike that would be justified hikes and not that the potential benefit you could see from this time deposit repricing?","Darren King","When we run our numbers, when we do our treasury forecast, and we look at what we think will happen and enough rate scenario, we've got all of those other things baked into that cake. So you know when I look at that our margin for the full year for 2017 and I look at where it - where we think it will show up compared to 2016, we think that 6 to 10 on average for the year is probably a good range. And again based on some of these changes that we've made business to the amount of cash as well as the deposit pricing, we think the higher end to that range makes some sense. And that's assuming no other rate increases when you talk about that.","Brian Klock","Gotcha.","Darren King","It probably starts out higher in the first quarter. Probably we expect it will start out higher in the first quarter, and then absent any other rate increases, there's still some of that core margin compression as the longer dated securities and loans run off that we're carrying a higher margin, there's still a little bit of margin compression baked in, and you'd see some modest compression from their throughout the year which you get you down to that average range that we talked about.","Brian Klock","Okay, very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey on the loan front, you had talked about and in fact realize it's an excellent amount of pure re-growth, and I'm wondering if you can talk through where are you seeing that some other peers have talk about a little bit of pullback you guys are very strong in the business and you are seem to be accelerating. Where you seeing the best opportunities and what's your execution to that type of growth can continue?","Darren King","Ken, good question. If you look at our CRE book and where the growth is coming from there's a couple of things. So one I\u2019ll remind you we made a - we commented that our commercial mortgage banking division that is more an origination in servicing business had some higher balances and help for sale at the end of the year which elevated that number a little bit. So we've got a bit of factor down the growth rate linked quarter to account for that.","And then when you look at where our growth is coming from in CRE in the third quarter - sorry in the fourth quarter, we saw most of our growth come from non-construction was more traditional CRE. However our construction balances grew in the fourth quarter from projects that we had agreed to finance earlier in the year and obviously as those projects come online and things happen then the balances grow and that's what's driving the growth in construction.","When we look at where it is, it's on a percentage basis, it's just proportionately New York City and New Jersey, New Jersey obviously because we're building our franchise there, so it's off a low base and then in New York City because it tends to be bigger projects. When we look at the types of projects that we're doing there, it's ones with customers that we've had a long relationship with, ones where they have lots of equity in the deal where the loan to values are very, very strong. So we feel pretty good about it.","We're not seeing as much in the retail space or the office space built on there, but kind of the places where we\u2019re seeing our growth and the types, structures that we're seeing. So we\u2019ve been changed our credit philosophy, it's still the same, I mean it\u2019s generally we're dealing with customers that we have a long relationship with.","Ken Usdin","Okay, and a broader question just on your mid-single-digit net outlook for loans and you kind of give us a little bit of the color that you'd expect a little slowing on the runoff part. So just wondering if you can kind of parse that apart because if you think about that I would imply still getting run off you\u2019re expecting still more than mid-single on the commercial side, and so do you expect more that to come from the C&I side then if you're slowing here, do you expect to slower rate of growth on CRE or is it actually a lot of slowdown in the mortgage runoff?","Darren King","It's probably both. We're expecting a pretty decent slowdown in the mortgage runoff based on where the - how the curve has moved since the election. And when we think about commercial balances, in general we expect them to both slowdown probably slightly bigger slowdown in CRE then C&I in a better balance than that what we might had in 2016 but just given where our knowledge bases and where our customers are, we think that CRE probably just slightly above C&I in 2017.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks Darren.","Darren King","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Another one on loan growth, I guess you talked quite bit about CRE bit of be interested in C&I as well. And then any broader observations, it just feels like most banks if you look at the industry days there or if you look at banks which have reported have had quite slow loan growth in the fourth quarter and you've been a real exception so and particularly if you strip out the Hudson City portfolio. Why do you think that is, what do you think you are doing differently or is different about your portfolio that\u2019s allowing you to grow when other banks are growing much more slowly?","Darren King","I guess when I look at what we think is happening with other banks loan growth, clearly on the CRE side, we've got a relatively unique approach to how we operate in that space and our philosophy there has been to follow our customers, and people we've done business with for a long time and they move in and out of the market and we move with them and they've been active.","And the C&I side, our philosophy isn't much different and that we've always been a relationship based bank and that we try and help our customers grow. When we look at across the geographies, when I look at C&I growth by region, we don't have any one region that's a particular standout in terms of where the growth is coming from. Again you might see from a percentage basis, a little disproportionate growth in New Jersey, but it's off that small base not really any particular industry when I look at and just got through there and get - if I can get the number when I look at where we think that are growth rates were versus the other guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management.","John Fox","Hi, good morning, everyone. I\u2019ve got two questions. First Darren, is there are other opportunities to buy additional securities that you feel like you are through that process of deploying cash?","Darren King","We feel like the place where we are now is where we've got the securities book that we anticipate that whatever cash should had come off earlier in the year that slowed down on reinvesting we've put back to work now and then we would look to kind of maintain whatever comes off, we would reinvest it, but not to do any more.","John Fox","Okay great. And then go back to the buyback. Given the large increase in the stock price over the last couple months just how do you guys thought about that in terms of the price you're paying and the capital ratios and just how you thought about the buyback with the higher stock price? Thank you.","Darren King","So the buyback as we mentioned before when we looked at, when we saw the volatility in the market post-election and things were going, there was lots of daily movements and large movements which is very uncharacteristic for a bank stocks. We just wanted to step aside and watch what was happening and see what we think was being reflected in the pricing and how our stock was moving vis-\u00e0-vis other peers and how we were performing versus the S&P 500.","And when we look at where we are now things have stabilized and settled down and now we trade versus our peers. We think we understand where the value is and what the valuation is and we feel comfortable that it makes sense to be back in the market and returning that excess capital to our shareholders.","John Fox","Okay, thank you.","Darren King","Just before we go on just to come back to the question Ken, I feel like we finish the answer on C&I and CRE. When we look at our C&I growth overtime, we tend to be a little bit higher than the market when things slow down a little bit lower than the market when things get busy. And if we look over 2014 and 2015 our growth rate C&I was actually half of what the market was and in 2016 we were a couple percentage points higher than the market, but not anywhere near our overall highs.","So much like our earnings and our credit originations also don't tend to exhibit a lot of volatility, but relative consistency and again what drives that is that our focus is always on supporting the growth of our customers and following them and that's what kind of gets you some of that consistency through time and you don't have big peaks and valleys in your originations.","I guess if you look over long periods of time that's kind of what we see and that's how we would respond to what's going on in the C&I space. CRE is not dissimilar, but it does tend to have a little more volatility in it just I think because of the size of the deals that get done that you can have big movements up or down.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Hi good morning. Maybe kind of touching on the loan growth point, do you have any comments on kind of how the conversations with clients have gone and your optimism about back half of the year and what and you could be there. And I guess particularly in expanding to New Jersey, do you feel like you're better position for that or is it just kind of similarly positioned to capitalize on any kind of uptick in demand?","Darren King","So I guess a little - I'll start with the question about optimism. So we survey our customers a couple times a year. And we actually had our fourth quarter customer survey going on during the election, and what's fascinating is we could look at the customers that had responded before the election results and those after. And in our own customer base the optimism jumps by six to 10 points after the election versus before the election.","And when we would ask our customers what was their biggest issue or hold back in investing it was business regulation, employee benefits, and access to people meaning qualified labor to grow their business. So those would be the things that were kind of on the minds of our customers when thinking about expansion and looking for lending it's not really been about access to capital or pricing.","When we look at New Jersey in particular we feel like we're in a good spot because we've been building out our own population in New Jersey and over the last couple years they've had the opportunity to put deals through our credit shop and start to understand our credit appetite how we price deals, how we structure deals, and just how we think about customer relationships. And I think that that philosophy and that culture starting to take hold there, and we can see it in the pipeline and we can see it in the type of deals that we're doing. So we feel like we're ready to respond to that marketplace and ready to do business.","David Eads","Great. And then may be if you could touch on credit just a little bit, you\u2019ve had a little bit of lumpiness on the commercial side both in 3Q and 4Q here. I mean just this is kind of typical lumpiness just with credit not being all getting better or is there something you know should we expect more of this lumpiness to continue?","Darren King","Well I guess commercial by definition is going to be lumpy. I think the fact that we're at the very best time in the credit cycle, and the non-accrual portfolio in the charge offs are still low that anyone deal going bad is disproportionately affects that number in the growth rate. So there's always going to be some lumpiness as we come off the lows in terms of charge offs anyone deal is going to exacerbate that number. But overall when we look at the quality of portfolio, we look at delinquency rates, we look at where there are none of rules are? There is nothing that is giving us pause for concern when we're looking through the book.","David Eads","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just following on the credit side a little bit. So provision higher this quarter totally makes sense to saw the $12 million commercial lumpiness did you just pointed out. But you also made a comment there that said that provision was higher just as you sort of remix the portfolio more towards commercial version in less on the resi side. So I guess when we think out towards 2017 does provision remain at kind of these higher levels versus what we saw say during 2016 even if charge offs remain serving that whatever the high teens low-20s basis points? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So I think from a provision perspective charge-offs will follow along based on non-accruals and delinquencies and obviously many of those will turn in charge-offs, but we don't see the meaningful acceleration in the rate of charge-offs, when we look at where the charge-off rate has been for last three years it's been relatively stable in that 18 basis points, 19 basis point range, but we know the long term average is higher than that, it's double that almost. So given where we are in the cycle it's got to start to move up a little bit.","And the access provisioning side it's going to be a functional loan growth, and given the long growth that we had in 2016 compared to 2015 and how skewed it was towards commercial balances that's what's going to that's what drove that excess provision on the overall. When we think about 2017 we think that the growth rate in some of those portfolios slows down a little bit, which means that that excess provision should slow down a little bit as well and then the only question is what happens with charge-offs as the year goes on.","Ken Zerbe","Gotcha. So I want to read too much into of a maybe I'm making too bigger deal over the portfolio mix from commercial versus resi, I mean I get it growth in line with longer and totally makes sense. But it's a far bigger driver than the mix between the two?","Darren King","In the near term mix that that's the bigger driver, yeah.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Ricky Dodds","Hey guys. It's actually Ricky Dodds from Matt\u2019s team, just wanted to ask a quick question on the tax rate. It came in a little bit lower than previous quarters and trying to see provide some color there and then perhaps if you can provide an outlook for the tax rate 2017?","Darren King","Sure. So the tax rate of fourth quarter was really a function of a lot of our employees exercising stock options that we\u2019re going to come do in this month and next year. I think a lot of people saw the run up in the stock and better take advantage of it, and we had an abnormal high level of selling, which led to its called as a disqualify disposition which the bank gets a tax benefit from that that was worth about 1% from the fourth quarter unless that continues we would anticipate the tax rate goes back to what we've seen through time in the first quarter and throughout 2017.","Don MacLeod","Just to clarify that's 1% on the tax rate.","Darren King","Thanks Don.","Ricky Dodds","And then maybe a quick follow up to that question on corporate tax rates in general and the potential cuts. Can you guys talk a little bit about what would be sort of the net impact to M&T if we did see a change to the corporate tax rate?","Darren King","So I guess that depends on what the changes, but based on the work we've done when we look at any change in tax rates, we think that whatever the changes the vast majority of it not all of it, but the vast majority of it would fall to the bottom line.","Ricky Dodds","Got it, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning. I want to just go back to the margin quickly, want to see what you're seeing in terms of a deposit data at this point from the coming off the December hike and then what you would - where you would expect that data to the trend for the incremental hikes that you could see this year? Thanks guys.","Darren King","So far the deposit base as we've seen are very low sub 10% or even sub 5% when we look very similar to what we saw based on the rate hike that happened at the end of 2015. As we go forward we expect that those rates are going to start to move up, but how quickly they move up. We think is a function of the pace of the movements by the Fed. So if the Fed makes one more move this year that's in the middle of the year, we think the data will still be fairly low compared to historical averages if the pace of rate increases by the Fed accelerates. We would expect to see those data start to move up.","John Pancari","Okay, all right, got it. And then separately on the expense side, just looking at operating efficiency and you're in that 56 to 57 range now maybe 56.5 I guess for the full year 2016. Can you just all things considered give us an idea of where you think that could fall out for full year 2017 and if you could see incremental improvement from where we\u2019re right now? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. I think if you look at our efficiency ratio and you actually look at it over the course of the last few years, it's been within a pretty tight range 55 to 57. You know when we think about the efficiency ratio we think about it as an output as opposed to a number that we per se try to target. We want to run each of our businesses as efficiently and as profitably as we can, and depending on that mix of business the efficiency rate and efficiency ratio can move up and down. So as we grow our mortgage servicing business or our wealth business those tend to be higher efficiency ratio businesses, but higher return on equity businesses as well.","So depending on the mix change also converting a thrift to a commercial bank, commercial banks running at higher efficiency ratio than thrifts, so those are some of things that will pressure that number up. We think we've help to improve or get some control on the expenses which should help it from going further up and then depending on what happens with rate increases. Rates will give us relief on the other side. So long winded way of saying I think we're in the range that we've been in we should be within that range through 2017 and I would expect to be towards the lower end of it.","John Pancari","Lower end of the 55 to 57?","Darren King","Yeah.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. All right thank you. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one I guess follow up. On the capital side I understand your reasoning on the on the buybacks, but it look like you had an increase in AOCI this quarter from the third quarter close to $200 million which seems a little counterintuitive given the rise in rates. So can you give a little color as to what's going on there?","Darren King","Yeah that\u2019s basically the mark-to-market on the mortgage backed securities that are in the securities portfolio with the change in interest rates.","Matt Burnell","Okay, okay. And then you mentioned your outlook for sort of flattish fees outside of the mortgage businesses, but I guess I'm just curious in terms of if we do get a greater increase there a phase of increase in interest rates, and then maybe just the one that we're all expecting in the middle of the year. Does that benefit the brokerage services? Does that benefit that the trust fee sorry in terms of the potential revenue growth there?","Darren King","Maybe slightly, but nothing that were not enough it would materially change our forecast on growth. I think there's some upside left of very, very small in waivers on some of the funds we should see most of that. We saw most of that with the first like we should see a little bit this year, but nothing that will materially change the growth trajectory.","We do have some of those businesses and associated with Wilmington Trust where we might get paid if you will and balances compared to fees and if rates go up people would not choose to hold those balances with us. They would tend to pay us with fees and part the balances somewhere else, so that would be something that would help move those - move the fee income up. But will it change the rate materially the 25 basis points change that growth rate materially. We don't expect that to happen.","Matt Burnell","Thanks very much, Darren.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line on Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Question for you over the years M&T has done a very good job of managing their capital obviously post the crisis things have changed, but in this most recent quarter you reported that you CET1 ratio is now 10.96%. Can you share with us what you think the ideal rate should be for M&T, and time that into push the very like strong likelihood that banks under $250 billion in assets in the upcoming CCAR are going to be relieved of the qualitative portion of the test which may enable you and your peers to even ask for more return of capital, I know you've been very good at doing that, but possibly even lifting it higher than levels achieved last year for you folks?","Darren King","Sure. So we did see an uptick in our CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter as we slow down the buyout it just served for me as a powerful reminder of our ability to generate capital as a bank and to move those numbers and it shows you how much we need to give back just to keep that number relatively flat.","If we look at our CET1 ratio when we do our work obviously we think we're carrying excess. Let me look at where that ratio is compared to our peer group or at the top end of that, I think from some of the work that we've done and shared at some of the conferences that range tends to go from 9.5% up to the high 10s and low-11s who sits in those buckets tends to vary a little bit from time to time, but the top and the bottom doesn't change that much.","And as we've said before we would think based on our credit profile and our losses through that we should be operating at the bottom end of that range. And it would be our objective to continue to do our work on CCAR to continue to do our work on CCAR to show the regulators that we can comfortably operate at that range and we continue to push it down.","As far as the impact of the qualitative fail being off the table, and I think we're still trying to figure out what exactly that means, there will still be supervisory reviews that will happen as part of the regular examination process. So there will still be looks into our process doesn't mean that you couldn't have a problem from your process it just would be public as the quality fails are. But we're happy that it's off the table, and we think it will start to move the industry towards pushing those levels down and we would look to do the same.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then as a follow up, obviously the Hudson deal closes at the end of 2015 you consolidated that of course into existing M&T is existing M&T footprint. As you look forward over the next 12 months maybe 18 months, is there any plans for branch rationalization that\u2019s firstly with the increased use of digital - in the digital channel for delivering retail products should we see maybe net basis more branch closures over the next 12 months or so?","Darren King","I think that's a reasonable expectation. One of the things that has happened actually over the last five years as we've been steady consolidators of branches, we just haven't ever had a big program that we've announced with that it's just part of how we run the bank to manage to our to be as efficient as possible.","If you look back over time from when we did our Provident acquisition our Wilmington Trust and then ultimately you'll start to see it with Hudson City that the rate of branch decrease versus what we acquired, we've been steadily pruning the network and we look at it on an annual basis we look at which of our branches are most coveted by our customers, as an industry we're lucky they vote every day with their feet, and we're able to see based on their transaction behavior, which ones are most important, and we're always looking at which locations people are using for sales and service and for ones that are becoming less relevant, we're not shy about closing them.","So a little bit of a long winded answer, but it's part of our D&A and part of how we've always run the bank and you know as these behaviors of our customers change we're addressing our network at the same time.","Don MacLeod","I can just bring the couple of numbers behind that. Immediately after the Wilmington deal we peaked at 781 full service branches. And in the last quarter before the Hudson deal we were at 684. So down just over about 100 over a four year time frame and then obviously Hudson brought it back to back up with another 135.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you Don, and thank Darren as well. Thank you.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Good morning. I was just wondering, can you talk about the new account prove that you are seeing this quarter, again what the disruption in the markets from the acquisitions?","Darren King","Sure. When I look at the account growth we had in the fourth quarter was still very strong compared to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, but tailed off compared to what we saw in the third quarter. When I look at the third quarter account growth, my focus just on Western New York or upstate New York rather, our account opening doubled in the third quarter compared to what they were in the second quarter and then they came back down not all the way down to the second quarter but just slightly above it in Q4.","So what tends to happen when there is a changeover and your market places when the branches change signs and when the customers get new statements and get new systems that they have to deal with that\u2019s what pushes people over the hedge and that\u2019s when you see the most activity in the market place. That\u2019s why when we talked over the quarters about our investment we made in marketing in our geographies in those time periods that\u2019s why we did it. Then - and we saw - we saw the results that we expected. And - but we\u2019ve seen things slow down a little bit from those highs in the third quarter which we also expected.","But four quarter is traditionally a slower account opening quarter. Note the time between Thanksgiving and New Year is usually a time when people are thinking about things other than banking but there is still some and when we look at how our fourth quarter numbers were, they were up over to fourth quarter last year, so we are pleased with that.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then - thank you. And just a quick follow-up. What left with satisfying the written agreement and do you think it would get satisfied this year?","Darren King","So the thing that we\u2019re finalizing is something it\u2019s called low risk customer remediation. So when you look at the risking the severe portfolio of customers, you categorize them into high medium and low based on a number of factors and then you are looking to capture additional information from those customers to confirm that they are in fact as risky as you believed.","We are anticipating completing those activities end of the first quarter early second quarter of this year and those would be the last parts to satisfy all the components of the written agreement. And of course once you\u2019ve done that then you need to have your internal audit review that and then your regulators can come in and determine whether or not you\u2019ve satisfied all the requirements and on and ask us for more information or to do anything else.","We\u2019ve been getting feedback all the way along on how we\u2019ve been doing in satisfying the terms of that agreement. Everything\u2019s been going great. We think we\u2019re well on track on that but the timing of - the timing of when we expected to finish our work is fairly certain. The timing on when we might get an opinion on whether we\u2019ve actually satisfied or not to from the regulator\u2019s perspective, the timing on that\u2019s a little bit less server.","Peter Winter","Okay. But you think the compliance costs are first quarter would then, would be the peak?","Darren King","They probably as it relates to the agreement peaked probably \u201815 maybe even late \u201814 you know that these activities are now baked into our BAU. And that the real big cost that we incurred as a result of the agreement was kind of the onetime setup cost to build our risk ranking model to build some of the infrastructure that we needed to support these activities. We would have seen most of that stuff in 2014-2015 and that\u2019s really not been there as much in 2016 and 2017. This is now part of life you know looking at this customer information and refreshing it and updating it is now just part of what we do on our go-forward basis and we\u2019ll be doing every year. So it\u2019s not material.","Peter Winter","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Spahr of CLSA.","Chris Spahr","Thank you. I was just wondering about your philosophy on charitable giving and what the incentive was at this quarter, was it strictly just linked to the gain on sale in the prior quarter?","Darren King","Pretty much that\u2019s what it is. I mean we obviously - we have a charitable foundation that we fund regularly. We were very philanthropic in our communities across all of our geographies and we look to fund that generally if we get what we consider win fall profit we all try to share that with the communities in which we do business.","Chris Spahr","And one final question, regarding long term debt, what is your view on long term debt as a percent of total funding and have we seen the kind of return over the portfolio to date or is there some more work to be done to the less where the cost of funds there?","Darren King","Well there is probably some turnover that\u2019s going to come in 2017 because we have some funding that\u2019s going to come due and we\u2019ll be doing some issuing there. What we\u2019re finalizing is when we will do it and how much we will do and what the structure will be you know exploding to manage the total cost of funds and we\u2019re also looking at what the mix of funding is on the balance sheet depending on how things go with deposit, volume, with the rate changes that are happening. So we expect to see some turnover in the portfolio in 2017 though we got a replace things are coming due and we expect that will be largely doing that and not much more.","Chris Spahr","Thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, are there any closing remarks?","Darren King","Again, thank you everyone for participating today.

[Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations, to begin. ","Donald MacLeod","Thank you, Lorrie, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events & Presentations link. ","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements. ","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As noted in this morning's release, M&T's results for the fourth quarter closed out a year of solid performance, which included 8% growth in earnings per common share; 11% growth in noninterest revenues, with mortgage banking and trust fees leading the improvement; a stable year-over-year net interest margin notwithstanding the interest rate volatility we experienced in 2019; a credit environment that remains favorable, which, although nonaccrual loans increased slightly, reflected the sixth consecutive year of credit losses below 20 basis points; and industry-leading returns on shareholder capital, with return on equity for the year improve slightly to 12.87% and return on tangible common equity exceeding 19% for the second consecutive year. ","We'll review the numbers for the full year in a moment, but first, let's turn our attention to the results for the fourth quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.60 for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $3.47 per share in the third quarter of 2019 and $3.76 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Net income for the quarter was $493 million compared with $480 million in the linked quarter and $546 million in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.6% and an annualized return on average common equity of 12.95%. ","This compares with rates of 1.58% and 12.73%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $3 million or $0.02 per common share, down slightly from $4 million and $0.03 per common share in the prior quarter. ","Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization was $496 million compared with $484 million in the linked quarter and $550 million in 2018's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.62 for the recent quarter compared with $3.50 in 2019's third quarter and $3.79 in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.67% and 19.08% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.66% and 18.85% in the third quarter of 2019. ","In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Both GAAP and net operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 were impacted by certain noteworthy items. ","Included in the fourth quarter 2018 results was a $20 million contribution to the M&T charitable foundation, that amounted to $15 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. Also included in 2018's fourth quarter was a $15 million reduction in M&T's provision for income taxes arising from an IRS approved change in the tax treatment of certain loan fees, which was retroactive to 2017. ","This also amounted to $0.11 per common share. Turning to the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.01 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, down $21 million from $1.04 billion in the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.64%, down 14 basis points from 3.78% in the linked quarter. A higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the Fed had an estimated 4 basis points dilutive effect on margin. ","Higher cash balances were a result of elevated escrow deposits, seasonally high commercial deposits and increased trust demand deposits. We estimate that the lower short-term interest rates on the Fed's July, September and October rate actions pressured the margin by as much as 10 basis points. The linked quarter 38 basis point decline in 1-month LIBOR was another factor in the decline. Included in that 10 basis point impact of lower rates was a decline in the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits, the cost of which declined by 9 basis points compared with the linked quarter, which provided a benefit to the margin of about 2 basis points. ","Average loans increased $167 million compared with the previous quarter. The ongoing and planned runoff of residential real estate loans, primarily acquired Hudson City mortgage loans, was more than offset by growth in other loan categories, which increased in total by $509 million or 0.7% from the third quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were about 1% higher than in the prior quarter. This included $110 million seasonal increase in loans to vehicle dealers to finance their inventories, combined with an almost equal increase in other C&I loans. ","Commercial real estate loans were down less than 1% compared with the third quarter reflecting payoffs as well as completed construction loans, which did not roll over into permanent financing and a lower level of commercial mortgage loans held for sale. Residential real estate loans, approximately half of which were acquired in the Hudson City transaction, continued the expected pace of pay downs and that portfolio declined by about 2% or $342 million. ","Consumer loans were up 3% with growth in recreation finance loans, and to a lesser extent, in direct auto loans, outpacing further declines in home equity lines and loans. On an end-of-period basis, loan growth was stronger in the commercial portfolios, with commercial and industrial loans, about 3% higher than at the end of the prior quarter, while commercial real estate loans were up about 2%. ","There were no particular regions or industries that stood out in terms of loan growth during the fourth quarter. Average consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office as well as CDs over $250,000 were up about 3% compared with the third quarter. As noted earlier, elevated escrow deposits, seasonally high commercial deposits and higher levels of trust demand deposits were the drivers of that increase. ","Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $521 million in the fourth quarter compared with $528 million in the prior quarter. The quarter's results included a $6 million or -- included $6 million of securities valuation losses on our remaining portfolio of GSE preferred stock compared with a $4 million gain in the third quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $118 million in the recent quarter compared with $137 million in the linked quarter. ","Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $697 million in the quarter, down about 16% compared with the third quarter. Nonetheless, origination revenues improved by $3 million to a total of $26 million as a result of higher gain on sale margin. Residential servicing revenues were little changed from the previous quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including both origination and servicing activities, were $91 million compared with $88 million in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $27 million in the fourth quarter compared with what was a record $49 million in the linked quarter. Trust income was $152 million in the recent quarter, improved from $144 million in the previous quarter, and up 12% from $135 million in 2018's fourth quarter.","New business generation continues to be strong, while the strength in equity markets has been a modest tailwind. Service charges on deposit accounts were $111 million, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. Trading and FX gains were $17 million, improved from $16 million in the previous quarter, primarily reflecting customer interest rate swap activity done on behalf of commercial customers in connection with loan originations during the quarter. ","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $819 million, down from $873 million in the third quarter. Salaries and benefits declined by $8 million to $469 million from the prior quarter, reflecting a lower headcount and seasonally lower benefit costs. Other costs of operation for the recent quarter reflect a $16 million reduction in the valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights. Recall that there was a $14 million addition to the allowance in the third quarter. ","Excluding the changes in the valuation allowance, other costs of operations declined by $825 million, driven largely by lower professional services expense. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator, was 53.1% in the recent quarter, improved from 55.9% in the previous quarter. Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality continues to be pretty much in line with the trends we've been seeing for quite a while. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with 16 basis points in the third quarter. The provision for credit losses was $54 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $13 million. The excess provision primarily reflects loan growth. The allowance for credit losses was $1.05 billion at the end of December. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.16% at the end of 2019, unchanged from the end of the third quarter and up 1 basis point from the end of 2018. ","Nonaccrual loans declined by $42 million at December 31 compared with the prior quarter end. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans fell 6 basis points to end the quarter at 1.06%. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $519 million at the end of the quarter. Of those loans, $480 million or 93% are guaranteed by government-related entities. We'll address CECL in a few moments during the discussion of our outlook for 2020. ","Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9.72% at the end of 2019, compared with 9.81% at the end of the third quarter. The decline reflects earnings retention during the quarter, share repurchases and the impact of loan growth, which, in turn, led to slightly higher end-of-period risk-weighted assets. M&T repurchased 1.7 million shares of its common stock during the past quarter, costing an aggregate $282 million. Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2019's full year results. GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share were $13.75, up 8% from $12.74 in 2018. Net income was $1.93 billion, improved from $1.92 billion in the prior year. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.61% and 12.87%, respectively. ","Net operating income, which excludes intangible amortization, was $1.94 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Net operating income for 2019, expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.69% and 19.08%, respectively. Average diluted common shares declined by 7% as a result of repurchase activity, while the total payout ratio, including common stock dividends, was 102%. ","Tangible book value per share grew to $75.44 at the end of 2019, up 9% from the end of 2018. As we reflect on our 2019 performance through the lens of relative performance against our peer group, large regional banks, we are particularly gratified by our growth in earnings per common share, our return on tangible common equity and the absolute level of our net interest margin, which remains at or near the top of the peers.","Donald MacLeod","Let me just backtrack a second for a minute, Darren. Going back to the other cost of operations, Darren misspoke and said, there was a decline of $825 million. It is $25 million.","Darren King","Thank you, Don. I'm not sure what I was looking at when I read that, but thank you for the clarification. Okay. So let's turn to the outlook. Looking forward into 2020, our outlook was fairly consistent with what we shared on the call last January as well as with the trends we've been seeing over the past quarter. While GDP growth may slow from the pace seen in 2019, we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen since the last recession ended.","Unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers' financial positions are healthy. Consumer confidence remains relatively high, although commercial customers have remained cautious as ongoing and unpredictable global events, including disagreements over tariffs have led to sustained levels of uncertainty. We were pleased to see progress toward the tailoring of capital and liquidity regulations for regional banks based on systemic risk to the U.S. economy. We are awaiting final approval for the capital regulations, including the stress capital buffer for banks in the Fed's Category IV like M&T. It's still unclear whether those rules will be in place for the 2020 CCAR process. However, with the usual caveat that events never unfold entirely in the manners you expect, here are a few thoughts for the coming year. ","As we share our outlook on the net interest income and the net interest margin, we'll start with the caveat that one unfolds will likely be impacted by actions taken by the Federal Reserve as to short-term interest rates. After a year of volatility, including 3 rate cuts over the course of 2019, the markets have calmed somewhat. The markets currently are signaling an additional rate cut in 2020 towards the end of the year. The fourth quarter net interest margin of 3.64% is a good starting point to think about where we're headed for 2020. ","We expect a lower combination of cash at the Fed and investment securities as we enter the first quarter and for that lower level to persist over the course of the year. This reflects a decline in escrow, commercial and trust demand deposits from seasonal highs in the fourth quarter as well as a further repositioning of our portfolio of liquid assets as the Fed's tailoring rule for liquidity becomes effective. The result will be a beneficial impact on the reported margin compared with the fourth quarter which could be as much as 10 basis points. Loans outstanding grew 2.4% on a full year average basis in 2019 and were up a similar 2.8% on a yearend basis. ","As has been the case for the past few years, this reflected a 9.1% decline in residential mortgage loans on a full year average basis, offset by 5.4% aggregate growth in other loan portfolios. Lending activity in the commercial bank in 2019, both Commercial and Industrial, and Commercial Real Estate was characterized by better originations and a reduced level of payoffs and paydowns than was the case in 2018. ","We expect those trends to continue in 2020. As has been the case for the past several years, we will continue to allow the Residential real estate portfolio to run off as we reposition the balance sheet to higher returning assets. However, the rate of decline on both the percentage and absolute dollar basis will slow compared to prior years as the portfolio of loans acquired with Hudson City becomes a smaller percentage of the total. ","Given these factors, our expectation for 2020 is that average total loans will grow on a full year basis at a low single digit pace, in line with or perhaps a little better than what we saw in 2019. ","Taking aggregate, our outlook for 2020 reflects a lower level of earning assets but with a higher proportion of loans than in 2019, which improves our return profile. Combined with some improvement in the margin from what we reported in the fourth quarter and a flat rate scenario, we expect low -- a low single-digit decline in net interest income on a year-over-year basis. ","We enter 2020 with a higher run rate in residential mortgage servicing revenues following the additions to our servicing and subservicing portfolios in 2019. Thus, year-over-year growth is sort of baked in. The outlook for residential originations is less clear with long-term rates above the low point seen this past summer. The commercial mortgage banking business had a record year for both volumes and revenues in 2019. Matching or beating that will be difficult, but that's our goal for 2020. ","The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in 2019 with growth in the low single-digit range, with the exception of trust revenues, which have been growing at a solid mid-single-digit pace. The fourth quarter's operating expenses, excluding the reduction in the MSR valuation allowance are a good indication of a starting run rate for modeling 2020. ","Last year's GAAP results included approximately $100 million of items we do not expect to recur in 2020. The write-down of our investment in the asset manager and the settlement of the eSoft litigation. That implies that total expenses on a GAAP basis should be down year-over-year. The capabilities we added to our IT division over the course of 2019 should enable us to continue to reduce professional services in the coming year as well. ","Other than normal wage growth, we don't foresee the need to accelerate expenses beyond the current run rate. We'd remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits costs in the first quarter of 2020, which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items. Last year, that increase was approximately $60 million. Based on the proceeding, we expect to be able to produce neutral to slightly positive operating leverage for the year. ","Our outlook for credit remains balanced. Just as we completed our sixth consecutive year of net charge-off experience below 20 points -- excuse me, below 20 basis points. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I'll caution you again that this trend can continue, and that losses will eventually tick upward. There continue to be some modest pressures on nonperforming and criticized loans but there are no apparent weaknesses in any particular industries or geographies. Our adoption of the new loan loss accounting standard known as CECL was effective January 1, 2020. ","Our expectation, based on forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of December 31, 2019, is that the adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately $140 million or 13% to our reserves. With total commercial reserves being down slightly, reflecting shorter contractual maturities and residential mortgage and consumer reserves increasing substantially due to their long dated maturities. ","For regulatory capital purposes, we have elected to phase in the CECL transitional amount over a 3-year period. Therefore, the effect of the adoption on the capital ratios will be recognized in a uniform manner, resulting in a reduction to the CET1 ratio by approximately 3 basis points over each of those 3 years.CECL also impacts the accounting for loans previously acquired at a discount that are on our balance sheet. ","Acquired impaired loans will transition from 90 days past due and accruing to their current performance status, whether accrual or nonaccrual. Approximately $170 million of the acquired impaired loans will transition to nonaccrual status. The income from these loans will only be recognized on an as cash is received basis, consistent with originated nonaccrual loans. Lastly, in the future, our loss provision will reflect expected net charge-off activity plus CECL reserves, for loan growth by category, plus or minus changes in our reasonable and supportable forecast. ","We don't see anything meaningful on the horizon that would lead us to believe that the tax rate for 2020 will be significantly different from what it was in 2019 in the area of 25%. As to capital, we'll continue to execute our 2019 capital plan through the end of this year's second quarter. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged with investments in our business at high returns being our first priority, while paying a dividend that's sustainable through economic cycles. After that, we seek but don't reach for acquisitions that make sense and add value to our shareholders, our customers and our communities. When those aren't forthcoming, we return capital to shareholders. ","We have little appetite for warehousing capital over an indeterminant timeframe until those opportunities present themselves. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. ","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Lorrie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Darren, just on the expense front, I'm wondering if you can just clarify a little bit on the point that GAAP expenses you expect to be down because they had that $100 million. And you mentioned that the core, you don't see it really changing from what the growth rate is. So the core, can you just help us understand without having to accelerate investments, what you see as the core underlying growth rate of expenses that you should expect?","Darren King","Sure. So I guess, if you look at the full year expenses on a GAAP basis, you've got about $100 million of 1x in the litigation, the addition of litigation reserve as well as the write-down on the asset manager. And then when you look at that number and you look at where we grow from there, it's 1% or less.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it. And then can you talk about the puts and takes just in that 1% or less? So you're making some investments that you've talked about in the last couple, where are you getting the saves out of and that confidence that you can keep it, 1% or less relative to the growth that we've seen in the last couple of years?","Darren King","Yes. Yes. When we look at the trajectory we've been on. Remember that a big portion of last year's growth and expenses was related to the mortgage business and the servicing that we both acquired and took on in the form of subservicings. We had that expense to support that revenue. And then the rest of what was happening was this transition of our IT capabilities from professional services to salary benefits. And we started to see those professional services come down in the fourth quarter, which we expected, and we expect that trend to continue into 2020. ","And so as we go forward, the gains and efficiency that we will get -- or expenses from reducing professional services will offset salaries and benefits as that cycle continues itself. So we think we're at a point where we're self-funding, and that's why we feel confident that the run rate that we're at now, we can basically run at that ex normal increases that happened in salaries and benefits as you go from year-to-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","On that same line of questioning, the -- so your operating leverage comment that you expect positive operating leverage, that's on a GAAP basis, just to confirm, correct?","Darren King","That is correct.","John Pancari","Okay. So -- and then looking at it from what you would just walk through in terms of core, that would imply modest negative on a core basis then?","Darren King","On a core basis, that would, yes.","John Pancari","Okay. And the -- and then in terms of your ongoing IT and franchise investments, I know you had indicated last quarter that they are largely complete. Is that still how you're viewing it? Or is there any change to the ongoing infrastructure investments that you're making?","Darren King","Well, we're continuing on the transition that we've talked about and that really is building up our internal IT capability. And we had the uptick in 2019, they got that process started. But from where we end the year, we're now in a place where we're seeing professional services come down that offset the salaries and benefits costs that we're adding as we're making those conversions. And the place that we're at now is we think that those investments are kind of self-funding. And so that with the expense base that we're at now, we can continue that transition without having to have meaningful growth. As we get to the other end of it, obviously, it's our expectation that we'll continue to use those internal team members to improve the expense run rate into 2021 and 2022. But obviously, we'll give you more details on that when we get there. But for the purposes of 2020, we think we're in a place where we can operate basically at the level that we're at now with some modest growth from here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","I wanted to inquire a little bit more about the potential for the margin beyond the first quarter. Heard you loud and clear that balance sheet action is going to be quite accretive in the first quarter. If the curve stays or the curve forecast stays static, how should we think about the net interest margin trajectory beyond the first quarter?","And also, as we think of earning asset growth, should we expect earning asset growth to be flat relative to the actions that you're taking? Or should we expect some balance sheet shrinkage?","Darren King","Sure. So in the first quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase, at least what the printed margin is because of the change that you'll see in cash and investment securities, and you can kind of see that at the end of period. And those lower levels we expect to persist throughout the year. So when you get to the first quarter margin, and assuming, as you pointed out, a fairly stable rate environment, we would expect that margin and -- that we end the first quarter with to be fairly consistent throughout the year, assuming that, that forward curve, in fact, occurs, maybe plus or minus a couple of basis points along the way, but relatively stable. ","We anticipate that the average earning assets will start the year lower, and then come up as the year goes on as we see the loan growth that we talked about in the forecast that, overall, it's kind of low single digits, and along the lines of what we saw in 2019 as we go through 2020.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my follow-up question, and I apologize, you're probably going to get 1,000 expense questions, but we just want to make sure we're getting it right. So as we think about the run rate for 2020. If we take $100 million out of GAAP, that's $3.368 billion, and you're saying growth of 1% or less. That includes any nominal increase in salaries and benefits. So in total, core should go up 1% or less from that $3.368 billion base.","Darren King","That's right. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","I was just curious on the capital. You ended the year at 9.72%. I'm just wondering where you think it's going to end in 2020. And then secondly, how much is left in your stock buyback authorization?","Darren King","So where we'll end in 2020 is a little bit tough to predict, just depending on what happens with the tailoring rules and SCB as we go into CCAR this year, which will have an impact, obviously, on where we might bring the capital ratios, too. And then the other thing that we're paying attention to is just the pace of loan growth and, in particular, risk-weighted assets. But if you look at where we've been over the course of the last, actually, kind of 5 or 6 quarters. It's been coming down around 9 to 10 basis points a quarter, and we continue a measured movement down towards the low end of the peer group. And over the course of the last year, I believe, we've gone from being slightly above our peer median in terms of our CET1 ratio to slightly below the median, and we'll continue a measured and thoughtful move down towards the range that we've discussed for some time now. Obviously paying attention to what's going on in the macro environment and what's happening with loan growth. And if you look at what's left outstanding in the capital plan that we discussed or disclosed in July. It's around $750 million, $800 million.","Peter Winter","Okay. And just given you're doing some of the work on remixing the balance sheet to help the margin. I'm just wondering, any updated thoughts on the hedging strategy?","Darren King","Nothing that is different from what we have talked about in the past. If you look at where we've been, our notional amount has grown, but what's actually outstanding has been relatively consistent. In terms of notional dollars, it's $14 billion, $15 billion of cash flow hedges, plus another $4 billion, $5 billion of debt. And what we've been doing is just extending some of those out into future years to have that same amount of protection in place for a little bit longer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Piper Sandler.","Frank Schiraldi","Just on -- to try to ask the capital question another way. Just curious, and I know you got the CCAR cycle coming up. But given how little impact -- little impact CECL has to the regulatory capital levels here, just curious, your thoughts on capital return overall for the back half of the year. Is it sort of the expectation, or I don't know, the wish list that you would continue to return 100% plus capital of earnings?","Darren King","I guess, we don't peg it as a payout ratio number that we're looking to achieve. But more we're projecting forward what we think our loan growth will be and what our risk-weighted asset growth will be and looking at what capital we think we need to fund to support that loan growth and make sure that we're running an organization that is very safe and sound. ","We continue to believe that we can move the current ratio down. And we'll continue to do it at the pace that we've been on for the last several quarters, being consistent in terms of what that decline is. ","Any quarter, you might see some difference between what the change is in the ratio based on primarily asset growth in the quarter. But when you look over the long term, over the last few quarters, we've been on a pretty steady pace. I think one of the things that we're also going to be watching as we go through the first part, at least of 2020, is just how the new CECL methodology impacts earnings on any given quarter, which will be impacted by the mix of loan growth in that quarter and just making sure that we're thoughtful with those capital returns. ","But as you point out, given where we are, we were pleased that the impact on our capital ratios from CECL was fairly nominal, and so we can continue on trajectory that we've been on.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. And then just sort of a ticky-tack question on the provision. Given -- if the environment, if the credit environment stays as is for 2020, let's hope. Given the day 1 CECL adjustment, is it -- and I know a lot more goes into it than this, but is it sort of fair for just modeling to assume provisioning goes up by sort of that 13% number, all else equal?","Darren King","I guess, I haven't done that, that way. The way I tend to think about it is you've got charge-offs that will happen. And then if you look at net growth in loans and look at the new allowance rate and multiply those 2, that probably gets you the excess provision. And of course, if you look in any quarter, the mix of loans that drive that shift in portfolio can move that around. But if you look over the course of a full year, we wouldn't anticipate any meaningful mix shift in terms of where the growth is coming from, on a percentage basis, which would give you that allowance percentage is a reasonable starting point. As I said, it could move around a little bit within that quarter, but over the course of the year, I would expect it to be within a few basis points of that number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","So regarding the anticipated decline in liquidity in 1Q '20. If we look at 1Q '19, you -- quarter-over-quarter, you're down $1.4 billion. Do you think you're going to have a similar decline in 1Q '20? Or is it much larger than that, just given how much more deposit growth you've had recently.","Darren King","It's probably going to be larger than that given the trust demand business was probably the primary driver, if you look back in prior years, plus a little bit in the commercial. Commercial balances tend to move up in the fourth quarter, and then these companies as they prepare to make their distributions to their owners. That's why you see them come down in the first quarter. ","And so that's pretty typical. I think businesses are still having a little bit more of their cash sitting in operating accounts versus in interest bearing. And then the other thing that's happened this year for us, obviously, as we've increased the escrow balances, and there is some seasonality to those. So when you put all those factors together, you'd probably get a bigger decrease there, and then we'll be looking at the securities portfolio in aggregate, and that will probably come down a little bit, too, as we react to the new changes in the LCR.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Got you. And then on the trust income, which came in much stronger than the original guidance call part. It didn't sound like market appreciation was a big factor. Give more color on why that was so strong this year.","Darren King","So there's a couple of things that happened there. We have, within there, a business that is olds' retirement assets. And when you add to -- when you add clients to that, you can -- they can come in big chunks, and we had 1 big retirement funds that came in during the course of the year. That stuff is kind of hard to predict, and that helped with some of the trust fees as well as in our, what we call, our institutional client services business. There seem to be a little bit more activity in that business as the back half of the year went on which helped with the trust fees. And obviously, when I talked about that retirement business, the assets that came on also grew because of the markets. And so there was some help from the markets to be sure but the business continues to add team members and add clients, and this had a strong year.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just one final one on expenses. I appreciate the color on the 1% expense growth in 2020, given the reinvestment of some of the cost saves. But what is expense growth at M&T running at these days without cost saves? What's the natural organic growth rate of expenses?","Darren King","When I think about our natural organic growth rate and you look at us through time, and you hold to the side some of the things that have happened with various litigation expenses or mortgage servicing rights or the write-off that we had. We're kind of a low single-digit grower, and it's mainly driven by compensation costs year-over-year. ","Last year was just kind of outside because of the mortgage -- the growth in the mortgage servicing business, and then step 1 in our transformation for technology. But generally, when you look at how we run the bank, we pay a lot of attention to our growth rate in expenses because we know we're in a tough industry. And so we're always looking for ways to manage those and keep them in aggregate, growing at low single digits and making investments and finding offsets to cover the cost to keep it at that pace. And that philosophy hasn't changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you give us some color on that residential mortgage portfolio? You indicated it was down, I think, the runoff that is, down about 9%. You expect it to be less this year. It looks like your resi mortgages at the end of the year are just over $16 billion or 18% of total loans. Where do you see that eventually bottoming out? When does the runoff from the deal that you've done? And we have a stabilized number from that portfolio.","Darren King","Sure. It's a good question, Gerard. As we watch the portfolio of residential mortgage loans. When you look underneath there, it's down to about 1\/2 Hudson's -- Legacy Hudson City mortgages and 1\/2 Legacy M&T plus new originations. We're allowing that Hudson City portfolio to run down, and we'll continue to just because of the return profile of the mortgage business. And the rate of growth or the rate of decline in aggregate in the mortgage portfolio is slowing just because the Hudson City mortgages are becoming a smaller percentage. But we'll continue to run those down. We'll probably -- you'll see a little bit more growth in the legacy business, especially some of that comes from the servicing business, but you're not going to see it hit a steady state likely in 2020. The only thing that as we work through the new liquidity rules after the tailoring that we're contemplating at what role the mortgage portfolio plays in overall funding since the mortgages are pledgeable with the Federal Home Loan Bank for funding on a short-term basis. So there's a number of considerations that go into where that portfolio ultimately ends, but we probably continue seeing it move down, but in a smaller dollar amount over the course of 2020.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then I know the rules are not set yet on the SCB, but from what you understand today and assuming they don't vary dramatically from what we all understand. Do you expect any kind of meaningful impact come CCAR because of -- if they incorporate the SEB in CCAR this year?","Darren King","I guess if they incorporate it, it would be helpful because the threshold that you have to meet would be lower, and there will be some opportunity there. There's also been talk of not having to pre-fund the dividend and not having an assumption of asset growth under stress, which all of those things are positive. The offset to that is what our loan growth assumptions look like. And in particular, what the mix is in terms of risk-weighted assets that will be an offset. But it's obviously -- remains to be seen how the -- this will be implemented by the Fed, given that there is unlikely to be an NPR before, and it will all be handled through the rules and the assumptions that are provided to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","I guess, we have 10 more minutes. A couple of questions. One, just a follow-up on CECL. By my calculations, your ACL ratio goes roughly from about 115 to about 130 basis points. As I think about the changes in your mix in the loss content on your net loan growth, because there's obviously a lot going on there with resi coming down, consumer going up. How do I think about the loss content, the lifetime losses on your growth relative to your back book? Is the net growth in loans, those with loss -- lifetime loss of above 130 basis points. I know it doesn't change in any given quarter all that much, but should we think that ACL ratio naturally gravitate upwards over time as your balance sheet remixes?","Darren King","I guess, if your time horizon is 10 years, and we don't do anything to change the growth rates of the various portfolios, that's probably true. I think if you look in the short-term. In short term, in this case, would be like over the next 12 and 24 months, you probably don't see much change in that, just because the start point on some of those other portfolios, meaning the other consumer, is relatively small as a percentage compared to the resi mortgage, the commercial real estate and the C&I. ","And that assumes that we don't do anything to look at those portfolios and look for alternatives, like you've seen some of the other organizations thinking about auto securitizations, for instance. We haven't done one of those in a while. I'm not suggesting that we are going to do one, but that would have an impact on, obviously, the portfolio and the allowance in there, because if you did a securitization that allowance would come off. ","So there are number of moving factors. But I guess the short answer to your question is, your math is consistent with ours. And I think it would take a couple of -- at least a couple of years of running at the rate that we're at with no change to see that number go up.","Saul Martinez","Okay. No, that's helpful. All right. I'll just change gears a little bit. At a conference in early November, I think it was a Banc conference. You highlighted your -- some of your key metrics versus your long-term averages. And your NIM, I think you were at substantially higher than what -- the premium up of your NIM, the delta between your NIM and the peer median was substantially higher today than it has been historically. I think it was like 6 basis points or something like that. And historically, it's 20 something in that neighborhood. It seems to like from your outlook, you think that really elevated delta with your peer group should remain not too far from where it is today. And I think you were kind of hinting at the conference that maybe that NIM, that excess NIM versus your peers will gravitate down over time. Am I reading that right? I mean, what's changed since November and -- other than, obviously, the rate outlook. But am I reading that right that you think you will be able to maintain a premium NIM that is historically high?","Darren King","I guess, I'll break apart your statement into two pieces. Do we think we'll be able to maintain a premium NIM? Yes. That's kind of always been the nature of our portfolio, largely because of our funding mix, but also because of the pricing on our loan book. It's been a little higher than what we would normally expect, and especially in this kind of time period. And you can see that the gap between us and the next closest peer on the median has come down a little bit. But really, when you look over the last couple of quarters, it's been fairly consistent. We would need to see rates come down a little bit further to see that delta compress. But we expect over time that we try to run bank to have slightly lower cost of deposits and a slightly higher yield on our loans and manage our expenses a little bit better in credit. It's not our objective to be outsized performance in any one of those categories, but a little bit better in each one. And over a long period of time, that adds up to consistent returns, which is really what our objective is. And some of them may move a little bit in any one-time period, be that a quarter or a year. ","But over long periods of time, that's kind of how we try to run the bank to achieve the returns that we do. So we expect that the margin depending -- obviously, given the earlier comments in a stable rate environment, we expect the margin to be relatively stable this year. Given that, we would expect to maintain our premium over the -- our GAAP, our positive GAAP compared to the next closest in the median. But any movement down, and we probably see a little bit of that road, but we don't see ending up back in the median.","Saul Martinez","Right. So as long as the rate environment remains stable, that historically, I doubt that there's no reason why that shouldn't progress.","Darren King","Yes. From what we can see, we believe that, that will persist. Wait, was your comment about 10 minutes? I thought you were going to use all 10.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock","We're set up for a good next year, right?","Darren King","We sure hope so. We're not planning afraid yet, but we're certainly hopeful.","Brian Klock","Well, I mean, hope is let's bring hope springs eternal on muffle every year, right? So let's hope so. But I think I do have 5 minutes left in the morning. I think that's what Saul was referring to before we say good afternoon. But just had few real quick follow-ups. I know you've had all kinds of questions today on both of these topics. So just I wanted to clarify a little bit on the margin guidance of 10 basis points, Darren?","Darren King","Yes.","Brian Klock","So is that all liquidity-driven 10 basis points? Or I think you guide, whether it was late December, early January, I think you redeemed some debt. So is that kind of factored into that sort of 10 basis point NIM improvement into the early part of 2020?","Darren King","It is. It's impact is, in the grand scheme of things, relatively small on the NIM impact. The main drivers are the cash and securities.","Brian Klock","Got it. Got it, makes sense. And again, on expenses. This is a 2021 question. But like you mentioned here, the core expense run rate, call it less than 1% inflation in 2020 on a core basis. And it feels like with all those tax expenses kind of consolidated and coming out, like you said, in recycling, do you think 2021 is one of those where expenses are flat? Or is it just maybe normal M&T expense inflation out into 2021?","Darren King","Well, your -- I'm just recovering from doing the plan for 2020, let alone, 2021. So haven't quite looked that far ahead yet. But I guess, I'll remind you of who we are and how we run the bank, and that is to be very careful with our expense growth to make sure that we see a path. If we make those investments to bring it back down or that there's offsetting revenue. Like we did with the mortgage business this year.","The low single-digit increase, as I mentioned before, is primarily the result of salary inflation, knows where wage inflation ends up through 2020. The unemployment rates stay this low, who knows where we'll end up. But we continue to believe that in banking business, efficiency matters and being cost-effective matters. So we pay a lot of attention to that. And of course, if we can drive that growth down to something less than 1% or even negative, we will look to do that. But too early for me to make comments really about where that will be in 2021.","Operator","Thank you. I will now return the call to Don MacLeod for closing comments.","Donald MacLeod","Again, thank you all for participating today.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. I would like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.","Before we start, I would like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the results, I want to take a moment to recognize and celebrate the story, career, and life of our late Chairman and CEO, Robert Wilmers or as we all knew him Bob. Simply stated, Bob was our leader, our mentor, and most of all our friend. As a leader, Bob's track record was unparalleled. Under his stewardship, M&T grew from its position as the fourth largest bank in Buffalo to a top 20 bank in the country, which is an accomplishment in and of itself.","To do so without suffering a quarterly loss and with the highest stock price appreciation amongst the 100 largest U.S. banks in existence in 1983 and which are still around today, says it all. He did the same thing with his vineyard in Bordeaux and was on a similar path with the newspapers in the Berkshires. Whether in civic or business life, Bob was truly a leader.","Bob\u2019s approach to mentoring was not what one might call traditional. Rather than fill you with advice about how to handle certain situations, Bob peppered you with questions. There were times I thought Bob only knew one word, why. Over time, you learned to ask questions of yourself from many angles, trying to anticipate where Bob might take the conversation. In fact, he pushed each of us to be better.","Another favorite question of Bob's was who is the best at fill in the blank? No matter what your answer, you knew that there was a new benchmark against which your performance was going to be measured. As a friend, Bob was extremely loyal. Once you earned his trust and respect, you had a friend for life, no matter what circumstances you might encounter.","Bob liked to joke with his friends, poking fun at any of us on the management team at every opportunity he could find, but it wasn't a one-way street. Bob could take it as well as he could dish it out, and never held a grudge when you landed the occasional zinger. To say we will miss him is an understatement, but not long after Bob passed, my sadness turned to pride, proud for all that Bob had accomplished in business and his personal life, proud to have been a small part of it, and proud to help carry it forward. Bob was a great man, whose impact will continue to be felt for years to come. But as you would expect, we move ahead.","Our management team has decades of experience working together in banking at M&T. Rene, Rich, and Kevin have the full support of the Board, the management team, and all of our 17,000 colleagues. We have a business model that works and a culture that works. And we all believe the best way to honor Bob is by continuing his legacy well into the future.","Lastly before we get to the financials, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge all of those on today's call who reached out with the note acknowledging Bob's passing. Your thoughts, prayers, and condolences gave us comfort in our time of sorrow and we are truly grateful for your friendship.","Now let's turn to the results for the fourth quarter and for the year. M&T\u2019s results for the fourth quarter were characterized by further modest expansion of the net interest margin and growth in net interest income. Trust fees remained a highlight, and expenses continued to be well controlled, and the credit environment remained solid.","Highlights for the year included 9% growth in net interest income, which was a result of the Federal Reserve's program to raise short-term interest rates combined with limited deposit repricing. Credit improved from the already strong levels seen over the past three years, but net charge-offs as a percentage of loans matching results seen in 2000 and 2006, otherwise the lowest since 1987. While loan growth did not meet our expectations that subdued growth enabled us to return the excess capital we generated back to our shareholders.","For the year, M&T repurchased $1.2 billion of common stock and paid an additional $457 million of common dividends to our shareholders. This resulted in a payout ratio for the year of 125%. The repurchase program resulted in a 3.4% decline in average diluted shares compared with 2016.","Now let's look at the specifics of the fourth quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.01 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $2.21 in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.98 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter was $322 million compared with $356 million in the linked quarter and $331 million in the year-ago quarter.","On a GAAP basis M&T\u2019s fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.06% and an annualized return on average common equity of 8.03%. This compares with rates of 1.18% and 8.89% respectively in the previous quarter. Included in the GAAP results in the recent quarter were after tax expenses from the amortization of intangibles assets amounting to $4 million or $0.03 per common share, down slightly from the prior quarter.","Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provide supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after tax effect of amortization of intangibles assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.","M&T\u2019s net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization was $327 million compared with $361 million in the linked quarter and $336 million in last year's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.04 in the recent quarter compared with $2.24 in 2017s third quarter and $2.01 in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.12% and 11.77% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.25% and 13.03% in the third quarter of 2017.","In accordance with the SEC\u2019s guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the third and fourth quarters of 2017, and the fourth quarter of 2016 were impacted by certain noteworthy items.","Included in the fourth quarter of 2017s results were $21 million of gains on investment securities, which arose primarily from the sale of preferred stock issued by the government sponsored mortgage enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or about $0.09 per common share.","Also included in the fourth quarter results was a contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation amounting to $44 million. That contribution amounted to $27 million after-tax effect or $0.18 per common share. The contribution exceeded the securities gains recognized during the quarter and brought the total contributions to the foundation for 2017 to $50 million.","M&T\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was also impacted by the changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates. M&T\u2019s provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter was increased by approximately $85 million as a result of the new tax law changes reflecting a revaluing of the corporation's net deferred tax assets. This amounted to $0.56 per common share. In aggregate, these items lowered net income for the quarter by $98 million or $0.65 per diluted common share.","As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2017, we increased the reserve for legal matters by $50 million. That increase coupled with the non-deductible nature of the $44 million payment to the U.S. Department of Justice relating to issues at Wilmington Trust Corporation prior to its acquisition by M&T, reduced M&T's net income in the third quarter by nearly $48 million or $0.31 of diluted earnings per common share. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we contributed $30 million to the M&T Charitable Foundation, which amounted to $18 million after-tax effect and $0.12 per common share.","Turning to the balance sheet in the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $980 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $14 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin improved to 3.56%, up 3 basis points from 3.53% in the linked quarter. We estimate that the increase in short-term interest rates notably one-month LIBOR in anticipation of the Fed's December rate action added a benefit to the margin of as much as 4 basis points.","Cash interest received our non-accrual loans combined with interest collected on loans previously charged off added an estimated 3 basis points to the fourth quarter margin. A higher level of average balances of funds placed on deposit with the Fed had an estimated 4 basis point dilutive effect on the margin. The higher cash balances were the result of both increased trust demand deposits and slower reinvestment of MBS cash flows.","Average loans declined less than 1% with the previous quarter, while commercial loan originations in the quarter were by far the strongest of any quarter in 2017, continued high levels of paydowns of both C&I and CRE loans combined with the ongoing runoff of the acquired Hudson City mortgage loans more than offset originations.","Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were about 1% lower in the linked quarter. While it did not affect the quarterly average, we did see $123 million seasonal increase in loans to auto dealers to finance their inventories at the end of the quarter, compared with the end of the prior quarter. Commercial real estate loans were down less than 1%, compared with the third quarter.","CRE growth continues to be challenged by loans funding construction projects. As those projects reached completion, they are being paid off with the proceeds from long-term often fixed rate permanent financing, not typically offered by M&T.","As noted, residential real estate loans which are largely comprised of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City transaction continue to paydown. The portfolio declined by about 3% consistent with previous quarters. Consumer loans were up 3%. Growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans continue to outpace declines in home equity lines and loans. Regionally, no one region stood out with C&I and CRE softness across all of our geographies.","Average consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T\u2019s Cayman Island office and CDs over $250,000 were up approximately 1% annualized compared with the third quarter. The higher levels of trust demand deposits I mentioned previously were partially offset by lower time deposits as the higher cost CDs acquired with the Hudson City acquisition continue to mature.","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $484 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $459 million in the prior quarter. Excluding the $21 million of securities gains I mentioned before, non-interest revenues grew slightly from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $96 million in the recent quarter, compared with $97 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $696 million in the quarter, down about 8% compared with the third quarter.","Total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were $62 million compared with $63 million in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $34 million in the fourth quarter unchanged from the relatively strong results seen in the previous quarter. Trust income was $130 million in the recent quarter, up from $125 million in the previous quarter, and up 6% from $122 million in last year's fourth quarter.","New business generation continues to be strong, particularly on the institutional side of our business. Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, compared with $109 million in the third quarter, essentially unchanged.","Turning to expenses; operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $789 million. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth quarters operating expenses included a $44 million contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation. While the third quarter included the $50 million addition to the reserve for legal matters, excluding those items, operating expenses declined slightly as legal expenses started to subside. The efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator was 54.7% in the recent quarter. That ratio was 56% in the previous quarter and 56.4% in 2016s fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to credit. Our credit quality continues to exceed expectations. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans was just 12 basis points for the fourth quarter, compared with 11 basis points in the third quarter. The provision for credit losses was $31 million in the recent quarter exceeding net charge-offs by $4 million. The allowance for credit losses was $1 billion at the end of December, and the ratio of the allowance to total loans increased slightly to 1.16%.","Non-accrual loans increased by $13 million at December 31, compared with the end of the prior quarter. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans increased by 1 basis point ending the quarter at 1%. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were $244 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $235 million or 96% are guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel-III capital rules was an estimated 10.93% compared with 10.98% at the end of the third quarter and which reflects earnings retention during the fourth quarter share repurchases and the impact from the net decline in end of period risk weighted assets. M&T repurchased $224 million of its common stock during the quarter.","As noted earlier, for the year M&T repurchased $1.2 billion of common stock and paid an additional $457 million of dividends to our common shareholders resulting in a 125% payout ratio for the year.","Next, I would like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2017s full-year results. GAAP based diluted earnings per common share were $8.70, up 12% from $7.78 in 2016. Net income was $1.41 billion improved from $1.32 billion in the prior year. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.17% and 8.87% respectively.","Net operating income which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses incurred in 2016 was $1.43 billion improved from $1.36 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating income for common share was $8.82, up 9% from $8.08 in 2016. Net operating income for 2017 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.23% and 13% respectively.","Turning to the outlook. Looking forward into 2018, we are as optimistic as we were at this same time last year. The economy appears poised to grow at a faster pace, unemployment remains low, and tax reform has been approved. While there has been little tangible progress in rolling back some of the post-crisis regulatory restrictions on the banking sector what we are seeing and hearing from Washington is very encouraging.","However, with the caveat that the events never unfold entirely in the manner you expect, there are a few thoughts on the coming year. Loans at the end of 2017 declined about 3% from the end of the 2016. This reflected a 13% decline in residential mortgage loans predominately those acquired with Hudson City, combined with the 4% decline in C&I loans, flattish CRE loans and 9% growth in consumer loans. While as noted, commercial originations in the fourth quarter were strongest of any quarter last year, paydowns continue to be elevated. Our pipeline is solid as we entered 2018.","The CRE market is active in areas such as multifamily and warehousing and distribution facilities to support the evolving retail sector. But as was the case in 2017, CRE loan growth will be impacted by our ability and appetite for providing permanent financing as construction projects reach completion.","We expect continued runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio likely at a double-digit pace, although the dollar amount of the decline will lessen as the portfolio continues to get smaller. And we continue to see attractive pricing and underwriting standards in the consumer area, not unlike last year. Given these trends, we expect 2018 overall to look much like 2017 with total loans flattish to growing at a low single-digit pace with payoffs and paydowns being the wildcard.","As has been the case, since the Fed began to raise interest rates late in 2015, our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further rate actions. A flat rate scenario should lead to some expansion of the margin as the benefit from last month's Fed action becomes fully embedded in the run rate, offsetting core margin compression. Further actions by the Fed in 2018 will potentially offer additional upside. Of course deposit pricing reactivity remains the unknown factor. Our projections reflect more pressure on deposit pricing than has been the case over the past two years.","Our outlook excludes the potential impact from cash balances brought in through Wilmington Trust, which could have an impact on the reported margin, but would only have an incremental effect on revenue. The level of cash on deposit at the Fed was lower at the end of the year than the average for the quarter.","Based on the current level of rates and reflecting the impact of interest rate hedges we entered into during this past year, we estimate that hypothetical future 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would result in a 5 basis point to 8 basis point benefit to the net interest margin. This also embeds an assumption on result in deposit pricing reactivity.","Based on those balance and margin assumptions, we expect modest year-over-year growth in net interest income, a higher interest rate environment will likely challenge mortgage banking in 2017, specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations. As we've noted previously, we have the capacity and appetite for additional servicing or sub-servicing business should opportunities present themselves. This could offer a potential offset to slower originations.","The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains stable with growth in the low-to-mid single-digit range in the potential for trust revenues to exceed that pace. For the most part, we expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2018, compared to 2017. That said, we anticipate investing some of the savings from lower taxes into our employees, technology and our communities. In the aggregate, this could amount to about 15% to 20% of the benefit from lower taxes spread over the next couple of years.","I'll remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in the first quarter of 2018, which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items. Last year that increase was approximately $50 million. While dependent on the level of the stock price at the time the equity grants vest we could see and a benefit to the tax line in the first quarter as was the case last year, although likely to smaller.","Our outlook for credit remains little changed. They\u2019re continue to be some modest pressures on non-performing and criticize loans, but there are no apparent pressures on particular industries or geographies. Our outlook for credit losses remains relatively stable.","Net charge-offs amounted to just 16 basis points last year, following 18 basis points in 2016 and 19 basis points in each of 2014 and 2015. All of which, are roughly half our long-term average of 35 basis points. In fact, 16 basis points of losses matched the levels we reported in 2006, but are otherwise the lowest we've experienced since 1987. But as we've said on this call last year and the year before, our conservatism won\u2019t let us count on beating that figure in 2017.","Regarding taxes, we believe the best way to illustrate how the new tax law might impact our results is to estimate what our effective tax rate would have been if the new laws had been in place at the beginning of 2017. We estimate that rate would have been 24.9% for full-year 2017. An effective tax rate in the range of 25% to 26% is a reasonable expectation for 2018.","As to capital, the combination of higher than expected earnings combined with slower than expected balance sheet growth has resulted in our capital levels remaining in excess of what we believe is necessary to operate in a safe and sound manner given our long history of low earnings and low credit volatility. And even though our total payout ratio for 2017 was 125%, the capital ratios are still higher than they were at the end of 2016.","We remain committed to returning capital that we can't deploy intelligently to our shareholders. And while we expect to continue to participate in the consolidation of the industry, we don't believe in warehousing capital until an opportunity presents itself. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions before which Scott will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to start \u2013 can you talk about \u2013 give more color on the C&I loan growth? You talked about paydowns being elevated, maybe can you quantify that? And what's your view how tax reform impacts loan growth in 2018?","Darren King","Okay. And we'll go through those in turn. So C&I loan growth, when we look at the fourth quarter and we talked about this on the third quarter call, fourth quarter originations were very strong, best quarter of the year, and when we entered the quarter, the pipeline at the end of the third quarter was as strong as we had seen all year. So those two things made a lot of sense to us.","What we've been seeing really throughout or had seen throughout 2017 was elevated paydowns in both CRE and C&I. When we have looked specifically at what we saw in C&I, we saw the increased activity largely from private equity whereby we had customers who were selling all our parts of their business because asset prices have been pretty inflated given the abundance of capital chasing deals.","And so that activity was a little higher than what we have historically seen, probably 5 to 10 percentage points higher than we had historically seen in terms of payoffs and paydowns as a result of that. So when we talk about that as a wildcard that's kind of where our thinking is, how much that continues, at what pace that continues a little bit hard to predict.","When you think about the impact of tax reform on lending and loan growth in 2018, it\u2019s hard to believe that it won't have a positive impact. To me and to us, the question is more the timing of how quickly that happen? I think if you \u2013 everyone is I believe trying to figure out what the impact of the tax reform means to them. For many businesses, what it means for their cash position, for their repatriating cash? How much of that cash they're going to use? What their current capital structure looks like, whether they're over the 30% or 35% limit on interest deductibility?","So there's a number of factors that I think people are just going to work their way through. And for us, we're not expecting a big up tick in the next quarter, but we expect as the year goes on and as the GDP growth takes hold and employment stays where it is or potentially gets better that you'll see some of that demand start to pick up as the year goes on.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask you one other question on deposits, you guys have really put up one of the lowest beta as we've seen in the industry, give us some color on the lack of deposit pressure or your commercial customers just not demanding more? Is there any pent up pressure where we might see a larger adjustment at some point? Thanks.","Darren King","Yes. So I guess a couple things on our deposit and overall cost of funds. You need to keep in mind that we\u2019ve continue to have our run down and repricing of our Hudson City time portfolio. So that's something that we have. That's a little bit unique to us compared to others in the industry. So that's helping our funding costs.","The other thing is we've done very well with maintaining non-interest bearing deposits and we've seen some migration into those accounts and a mix shift has helped with our overall cost of funding.","When you look underneath and you see where some of the pricing movement is happening, certainly our trust demand deposits and our mortgage escrow balances are typically linked to the index, so those ones are 100% reactive.","When we look underneath at our private banking and our commercial, we saw a bigger uptick in our pricing in the third quarter than we did in the fourth. The fourth quarter prices moved up a little bit in those two categories, but not as much as we had seen in the third quarter.","And I think on the commercial side, there's certainly some pressure there. I\u2019ll remind you that that's earnings credit, which kind of shows up as an offset to fees. And generally balances are still strong, folks haven't put that those balances to use yet in the business. So they have more than enough fee offsets that they're not demanding as much from an earnings credit rate at the moment.","We've got our eye on that. It's something we pay a lot of attention to and we're always considering what the impact is of earnings credit rates versus balance diminishment, and those two things cannot offset each other, and we pay a lot of attention to that. But it's something I think us and the industry are all expecting to see, but we take a 25 basis point increase by 25 basis point increase.","Steven Alexopoulos","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Darren King","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Darren, I wondered if you can talk a little bit more about the \u2013 on the expense growth. I believe \u2013 just want to confirm, you indicated nominal expense growth for 2018 and then also what would that equate in terms of the amount of positive operating leverage that you could expect for the year? Thanks.","Darren King","So here's how I would think about expenses. If you look at the third and second quarter of 2017, those would be more normal expenses, so third quarter you want to take out the legal settlement, but otherwise those quarters kind of give you a good sense of where the run rate is on average. And starting from that base, we anticipate expense growth less than 2%.","And then we announced last night that we plan to invest some of the tax savings in our hourly employees, many of those are the face of the bank. There are tellers and our telephone center reps, and we expect that to increase the expenses a little bit beyond that 2%-ish growth rate that I mentioned prior, and if you put those together that's kind of where the expenses are to come out for the year.","When you think about operating leverage, I would expect, we would be 1% to 2% positive operating leverage over the course of the year and that could move depending on when and by how much the Fed changes Fed funds rates.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks. And then separately on the capital side, I heard you on the \u2013 that you're not going to warehouse until opportunities come up, but on that opportunistic angle, can you give us your updated thoughts around acquisitions on the whole bank side and non-bank? What are you seeing and what do you think is likely to materialize for 2018? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So our thoughts about acquisition and what makes sense for us hasn't changed from what we\u2019ve talked about in the third quarter. Obviously, we\u2019re interested in whole banks. We\u2019d be interested in branch networks, but we'd also be interested in wealth and asset management as well as mortgage servicing. So it's pretty broad, the types of things we would consider.","I guess I would describe the market right now is fairly quiet. I think everyone is digesting what tax reform means for them, what it might mean for their business. Their digesting the current credit environment and what that looks like? And so from what we've seen right now, there's a lot of activity, which is why we've made the comment that we wouldn't sit and wait for something to come around before we deployed capital back to our shareholders.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Just go back to the comment that you said you're going to reinvest, called 15% to 20% of the tax savings back into the business. Obviously, I saw the $25 million you talked about, which is probably a little less than the 15% to 20%. But what are their actions are you thinking about that you could be taking that you're referring too in terms of following it back into expenses? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So as you mentioned, we talked about the increase to the hourly rates once fully implemented. Those will be worth about $25 million, we think on a run rate. There is other actions that we are considering for employees like 401(k), match increases things like that. So investing in our employees will continue to invest in our communities. Traditionally we've given [1.9%] of net income every year to our communities and with the tax increase. We would expect to benefit our communities a little bit with that.","And then the other thing is continued increase in our infrastructure in particular technology. And so we described an increase of 15% to 20% of the savings over the next couple of years, but these things will feather in over the course of 2018 and 2019, as we do our work and we think about what ways of investing that those dollars will be most impactful for our business.","Obviously technology is something that's important and we will continue to invest in. But it's not one of those things that you can just write a check tomorrow and pay for software off the shelf and then go back to a different run rate. It starts to embed in your expense base and will be thoughtful about how we do that, but we thought it was important to signal where our intentions were going.","Ken Zerbe","Got, understood. And then just \u2013 in terms of credit, I think you said the outlook is relatively stable, obviously your first half credit was different from the second half credit. Are you talking about full-year stable or stable from sort of fourth quarter levels?","Darren King","I think in stable more from like the last four years, stable and I'm thinking more \u2013 both the third quarter was very strong. The fourth quarter was strong and impacted by recoveries. So if you look at where we had been in the prior three years that's kind of where our head is that.","Ken Zerbe","Got, understood. And then just last question, in terms of the CRE growth or lack of CRE growth, I think you mentioned that the growth going forward is going to depend on your willingness to offer more perm financing, which you've been hesitant to do. What does that depend on? Is just the yield? Are you seeing bad structures in the market, but why are you not in that market today and what might get you in there?","Darren King","So primarily it's pricing. That the yields and the rates that are being offered by our competitors are lower than we think make economic sense for us over the long-term, obviously there's a relationship involved. Those are mortgages that we will do. But this year has been particularly active. We've seen the insurance companies particularly active in the 10-year space with a lot of interest only option. So it's just not something we've generally participated in. If the pricing changes and returns change, then our activity in that space would likely change as well.","But the big issue for us on the construction or the commercial real estate is we had that run up through 2015 and 2016 in construction and as those projects come to completion they paydown, which is \u2013 it actually a good thing because that's what we're really hoping for when we do those loans is that they'll get completed and people will take over the permanent financing if it's multifamily or the condo owners obviously accept their units and pay us down, but take out a personal mortgage so.","Ken Zerbe","Right.","Darren King","Not expecting any material change, given what we see out there in the world right now, but obviously if rates change, we would be willing to participate.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Darren, I want to ask you about a mix of the balance sheet. I notice that the securities portfolio has shrunk over the course of the year, offset on the wholesale borrowing side. Just can you help us understand just where your comfort zone is both in absolute levels of that securities book and whether or not that changing rate environment will cause you to think about adding \u2013 to turning the corner on that going forward?","Darren King","Sure. So the securities portfolio, the primary driver is liquidity coverage ratio. And what we need to have in securities to make sure that we're compliant with the coverage ratio. When you look at the last little bit or over the course of the year, given how the balance sheet has evolved, we haven't needed the securities portfolio to be as big and that moves around a little bit with our cash balances, which are affected by trust demand, but then also how we choose to reinvest the mortgage-backed securities payoffs that sit within the securities portfolio.","And really over the last quarter, maybe the last two quarters a little bit given where short rates were when we looked at what was running off and where rates were likely going, we've felt better just keeping that in cash because the premium you were getting to invest it for two years wasn't really worth it.","So as you go forward, I'd be looking at cash and securities together and where we need to see some \u2013 have a better feeling about what the shape of the curve is going to look like before we make any decisions to change that reinvestment rate or change the mix of what we\u2019re investing in.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it. And then to follow-up on that deposit side, you mentioned that the Hudson City loan book might start slowing its rate of decline. Can you help us understand the offsetting side of that on the time deposits, like how much \u2013 how fast and how much of that is still left to runoff that how fast do you think that will be running down?","Darren King","So the rate of decrease is slowing just in dollar certainly because the portfolio is smaller. When you look at what's left to reprice, we're down to less than a third of the balances that need to reprice. Much of the book has shifted towards shorter duration CDs typically six months or a year. And when we're in the market most of the activity is in that one-year space.","We are starting to see a little bit of movement into two-year, but really it's all been around one-year is where all the activity is. So what's out there are some longer dated CDs that were three and five years back at origination and as those come due obviously they'll reprice and they'll either likely go short, which is what has been typical if they stay on the balance sheet or the runoff.","I would be thinking $1 billion to $2 billion of additional runoff and time in those CDs that are Hudson City related over the next 12 to 18 months. The offset to that is when you come out of a lower interest rate environment, generally the place where balances move first is into the time deposit. So while there might be some decrease in legacy Hudson City time deposits. When you look at the total time deposit category, it might not decrease by that same amount because we expect we'll see some shift of money market in the time over the course of 2018.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. I understood. Thanks for that Darren.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Back to technology, you touched on that briefly earlier scenario where you'd like to invest. How do you think you stock out there relative to peers and competitors?","Darren King","Well, it's a good question. I don't have a great benchmark for what others look like. You have the most obvious ones, which are your mobile devices which are probably the most benchmark of anything. When I look at our online and in branch capabilities, I think we stack up well. I think on the mobile we're competitive, but we will be looking to improve in our mobile channel through time.","We're teed up to implement Zelle this year, which will be a big positive, and we're looking forward too. But I guess when we think about mobile technology across all of our lines of business, our view is that mobile is now regular cost of doing business and it's not a technology event, right.","So when you think about you see on your phone, the little red circle in the corner of an app that says by the App Store there's an update available. That's the mentality that we're bringing to mobile. It\u2019s something that you're going to be constantly providing updates and new feature functionality, which will really become an embedded expense.","When you look across the rest of the franchise that what's datacenter versus what's cloud and core applications. Our core applications are pretty much the same as everyone else, and in fact, we believe that we have fewer of them than others because our acquisition history was not to maintain dual system environments, but to consolidate always to one.","But we're always investing and maintaining those core systems or investing in infrastructure like data, investing in security, cyber security obviously being a big one and making sure that our environment is safe. So there's a number of places where we're investing technology dollars. Some of them very visible to the outside world, but many of them inside to the bank and making sure that we're stable and safe.","Geoffrey Elliott","And when you think about potential M&A, do you think you could do M&A to acquire new tech capabilities is not something you\u2019d look out?","Darren King","That\u2019s a really good question. I think when we look at technology, we would be open to talking to people to bring technology capability to our customers, but to acquire another bank just to get their systems is probably a tough one. And the reason I say that, I would never say never, but the reason I say that is typically you're buying a bank that's smaller than you. And if you\u2019re going to convert M&T on to a smaller bank systems and technology architecture and infrastructure, you'd want to be really certain that it was ready to handle that kind of volume, right.","Typically we're very conservative and worried about risk, and to that end, we've generally converted others on to our systems because as a percentage of the business it's small and we know that we can handle it from an infrastructure perspective, and it minimizes the risk should something go bad. But are we looking more at partner opportunities to deploy new technology? Absolutely. And could that mean investments in some of those? We'd be open to it, if it makes sense.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.","Brian Klock","Hey. Good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","On the expense side, I just want to kind of catch back up and just make sure I understand the guidance. When you look at the last three quarters on an operating basis, taking out the Wilmington Trust and the charitable donation in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s averaging about $755 million a quarter. So that's the base we should be thinking about quarterly and then grow that by 2% when we think about 2018, is that the right way to think about that?","Darren King","That's the right way to think about it. Yes, and obviously you've got the first quarter increase that is pretty typical, and then the $25 million that we disclosed yesterday that would be the run rate of investments in our employees.","Brian Klock","So that $25 million would be additive to the 2% growth on top of that?","Darren King","That's right. But you won\u2019t see the full $25 million likely in 2018, it'll come in over the course of the year, and the full $25 million would be more likely in 2019s run rate.","Brian Klock","Okay. And then really the other cost of operations in the fourth quarter that typically can be seasonally higher for you guys in the fourth quarter and when you adjust it for the Wilmington Trust and the charitable donation, it was down about $15 million sequentially. And usually, the first quarter is when you see it come down from the fourth quarter, so is there any seasonality we should look at in that line item? If we adjust to $212.9 million for the $44 million, is that something you expect to be flat or is that something we\u2019ll see this normally seasonally slower or lower first quarter out of that line item?","Darren King","There's movement in that and it's not really seasonality per se. It can just be timing of when certain expenses hit. I think the safest thing to do is to look at our annual other costs and divide it by four and we're not anticipating anything that's going to drive it up materially in 2018 or down. The one thing to keep in mind is in their professional services expenses some relating to technology and some relating to legal, and we're hoping that we're going to run at a slightly lower legal costs in 2018, but we do have the next wave of trial coming up in the spring. So it might not move down quite as much as we would like early in the year, and then we'll see what happens from there. So I would take the total year number and think about that averaged on a quarterly basis.","Brian Klock","I got and just the last follow-up on the end of period balances and you talked about the excess liquidity at the Fed is down, end of period versus the average. It looks like a lot of that came out of interest-bearing deposits. If can talk about that end of period, the balance trend and with a lot of that from Hudson City time deposits that $1.5 billion that came out of interest-bearing deposits on end of period base?","Darren King","It's a combination of trust and there's some mortgage escrow and there as well that moves around, say about $0.5 billion is mortgage escrow and some of its time probably $300 million to $400 million and then other just normal movement up and down in the quarter. And I guess partly we made the comment about the cash at the Fed, when thinking about first quarter margin that the increase in cash reduced the margin in the fourth quarter even though it was a very visible by about 4 basis points just because of the rate there right. So if it goes away, the market is going to go the other way in the first quarter, but doesn't necessarily mean that net income is going to go correspondingly higher.","Brian Klock","That\u2019s exactly great. All right, thanks for your time, appreciated Darren.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Hi, you guys have addressed, so I think most of the kind of guidance questions that I would have had. But maybe from the strategic point of view, if you look at the fee businesses, you've obviously had some good momentum in trust and you talked about building out the mortgage servicing. How about in the capital markets side? This is an area that we've seen some of your peers build-out and it does seem like it provides a little bit of hedge from C&I loans going and CRE going to the capital markets instead of loan balance sheet. Maybe you could remind us like what your capabilities are there and just the thoughts of organic growth or I guess bolt-on deals in that broader space?","Darren King","Sure. We do some M&A advisory of a small operation that operates at a Baltimore that helps our customers when they're considering M&A activity and we also have a debt capital markets business that also operates at a Baltimore. Those businesses both had some modest increases year-over-year in terms of their fees that we\u2019re in. So it's a space that we're in.","We think there's upside there, probably lean a little bit more right now in the debt capital markets side than in M&A. But really when we look at where other parts of our fee business have been, it's been in the commercial mortgage space and when you think about our balance sheet with our heavy commercial real estate focus at our expertise there that's a good feeder system for our commercial mortgage fee business.","And at the end of last year, we added a team in Philadelphia that complements that business that their specialty is more dealing with insurance companies and placing business with insurance companies where we've been in Fannie and Freddie DUS lender and that's a place where we saw some nice growth this year in fees and we expect to continue to see that happening in 2018 as well, and it's a nice complement to our commercial real estate business.","So there's a few places where we try to participate on the fees side to your point as a complement to the balance sheet part of our business. We don't have any specific plans to grow aggressively in debt capital markets or M&A, but it's something we certainly pay attention to given the commercial orientation of our balance sheet.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Frank Schiraldi","Hi, Darren. Just two quick ones, first on the NIM, I think you noted 5 to 8 bps of NIM benefit from a 25 basis point hike is a good way to think about things. So for the December rate hike, does it make sense to further adjust that range by the 4 bps you kind of noted on LIBOR getting ahead of itself, does that make sense?","Darren King","So the 5 to 8 bps that we noted earlier is really on a go forward basis and we have been talking about 6 to 10 bps is where we had been and the last rate hike would fall more in the 6 to 10 bps. So I would think about the 4 as along the path to that 6 to 10 bps and we'll get a little bit \u2013 the rest of it in January depending on what happens with deposit pricing.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay, gotcha. And then just on the effective tax rate you cited. The lower relative percentage decrease, I guess M&T expects to see versus just the statutory federal reduction from 35% to 21%. Is that basically all due to just the impact from state and local taxes or is there anything else in there that's somewhat meaningful offset?","Darren King","You nailed it. It\u2019s pretty much all the states we\u2019re in and the impact of state and local tax.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Christopher Spahr","Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering, is it possible to eliminate your bank holding company charter, given how your businesses are structured particularly if the bank regulatory relief doesn't really come down to the states at $100 billion threshold that some have suggested recently?","Darren King","I think the answer technically is yes. It's possible, anything's possible, but when you look through the businesses that we have underneath of it and the way they're structured, right now we don't really see the benefit. Something we looked at after the announcements from Zions earlier this year and concluded it didn't make sense for us at that point, especially given some of the proposed legislation of relief for banks less than $250 billion. So we're \u2013 for the moment watching that with interest and we can see what happens. It's something we would consider, but at the moment, we don't have any plans to make any changes to our structure.","Christopher Spahr","And given that your balance sheet hasn't been growing recently, is that safe to assume at least for 2018 that long-term debt will remain flattish this coming year?","Darren King","Well, we've got some debt rolling off, and obviously we\u2019ll be watching where the loan growth is and what's going on with deposits. And then our capital structure and the amount of capital that we have, we commented a couple times about where we feel our capital ratios are relative to where we think they should be and so there might be some mix shift on the balance sheet between debt and equity as well. So those will be the factors to consider when thinking about debt for the year.","Christopher Spahr","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Thank you. Darren, in regards to capital return just given the valuation of M&T, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are looking at share buyback versus dividends?","Darren King","So when you look at our history and you look at the mix of distributions through time that are between dividends, stock buyback, and M&A, those tend to move around a little bit depending on the environment we're in. But as we look into 2018, given the change in tax rate and the appreciation our stock price, our dividend yield and our dividend payout ratio is likely to \u2013 both going to be down.","So we'll be looking at what our dividend yield is and what the dividend payout ratio is and thinking about that in conjunction with our distributions and the rest we would look at as capital returns. But over time that mix between dividend and share repurchase, we don't expect to change that much.","So we will make our adjustments, and as we go through our CCAR work, and obviously we've got to increase in the dividend planned for next quarter in the second quarter of 2018, and we'll obviously look at the mix as we go through CCAR and look to return capital in the most friendly way for the shareholders.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thank you. And just on a separate note, net interest income in the first quarter, I'm just wondering \u2013 assuming that the interest recoveries don't reoccur, which I think is about $8 million and then two less days in the quarter, do you think, net interest income would be down slightly from fourth to first?","Darren King","Maybe I\u2019ll touch. You definitely got two less days, that\u2019s important. And then it will be about \u2013 our calculations, $3 million to $5 million of recovery. So you've got those two things working against you, but we'll have the full quarter of the hike helping on the other side. So I guess when we look at it, we're thinking flattish or flattish to slightly down first quarter versus fourth quarter.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on some of your commentary on mortgage servicing and potential M&A there. Why do you view that business to be attractive right now given that we've seen many banks shy away from mortgage servicing and have issues with it through the cycle?","Darren King","So I guess when we look at the mortgage servicing business, we think about both service and sub-servicing. And the number one thing that we like about the business is the returns and the return on equity. And we think that that is helpful to our overall return profile, and if it's servicing, we're not tying up the balance sheet \u2013 if it\u2019s sub-servicing I should say, we're not tying up the balance sheet.","But we're selective. When you look at \u2013 if we look at the pricing and we look at what the return measures look like of any business we might do and like any investment decision we make, whether it's a new loan, buying another bank or investing in sub-servicing, it has to make sense for our shareholders. And over time, particularly during the aftermath of the crisis, it proved to be a business that people were shying away from mainly because of reputational risk and some of the fines that were out there.","So it placed a premium on operational excellence. And we've been through a number of reviews with our regulators, both the Fed and the CFPB, and proven to be a pretty clean shop in terms of our operations. And therefore, we believe we can manage the reputational risk and the operational risk. And if we can get paid for it, which we were able to, then we like the business. If those dynamics change and the returns change, then we won\u2019t like it as much, but from where we've been over the last five years, it's been a great source of fee income and return for us.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then a follow-up on that. Is there a certain size you are targeting where you start to see the returns on those portfolios that you could acquire start to hit peak margins or to really grow to a level where scale really matters?","Darren King","From what we see, we're far from that. At our peak, we\u2019re servicing about $99 billion worth of mortgages. There's not a circumstance that we currently envision that takes that to $200 billion anytime soon. It's been when we've acquired servicing. It's tended to come in smaller chunks and kind of $15 million to $20 million \u2013 $15 billion to $20 billion size lots, which is easier to integrate, easier to manage the transition, and doesn't get us over our skis in terms of the size of portfolio we're trying to manage and the risk we're trying to manage.","But it's really \u2013 we're looking at each potential deal, what the mix of mortgages looks like, how challenged it may or may not be based on delinquency, the mix of Freddies and Ginnies that are in the portfolio and the regional mix. There\u2019s a whole bunch of things that we consider before going forward. But at this point, it's not something we're looking to make a major business, but given our experience in mortgage and our ability to service it's been a nice complement to businesses that we're in, and again, a nice source of fee income in return for us.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

At this time all lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ","It is now pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Don MacLeod to begin, please go ahead sir.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Maria, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I'd like to thank everybody for participating in M&T's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you Don, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As I noted in this morning\u2019s press release our third quarter performance was marked by relatively subdued revenue trends with modest growth in average loans and a slight decline in fee income coming off a strong second quarter.","That said, credit continued to trend positively. We\u2019re also pleased with our continued progress on our BSA\/AML compliance, risk management and capital planning initiatives, the progress we made during the quarter. And while maintaining that progress has meant a continuation of an elevated level of operating expenses we firmly believe that those investments will position us well for the future.","As we usually do, I\u2019ll start by reviewing a few of the highlights from M&T's third quarter results after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions. Going to the specific numbers, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.91 for the third quarter of 2014, compared with $1.98 in the second quarter and $2.11 in the third quarter of 2013. Net income for the recent period was $275 million, compared with $284 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $294 million in the year ago quarter. There were no noteworthy items impacting M&T's third quarter result.","Results for last year's third quarter were benefited by $34 million of after tax securities gains which amounted to $0.26 per share. Since 1998 M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $5 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $6 million and $0.04 per share in the prior quarter.","M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $280 million compared with $290 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.94 for the recent quarter compared with $2.02 in the linked quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible asset and average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity of 1.24% and 13.8% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.35% and 14.92% in the second quarter of 2014. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $675 million for the third quarter of 2014, unchanged from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.23% during the quarter, down 17 basis points, compared with 3.40% in the second quarter. The margin compression was driven by the following components.","We continue to build out our liquid asset buffer earlier in the quarter prior to the adoption of the final LCR rule and the delay of its implementation for banks like M&T until 2016. We purchased $1.7 billion of securities during the quarter funded by $1.7 billion of bank notes issued in late July. We estimate the impact from those actions combined with the full quarter effect from our actions in the second quarter reduce the margin by about 6 basis points.","During the quarter we had a further increase in deposits from our institutional trust business and which we held at the Federal Reserve. On an average basis interest bearing deposits with banks including the Fed was some $1 billion higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter and we estimate that this further elevation of excess funds diluted the margin by 3 basis points as compared to the last quarter.","The end of period balance for interest bearing deposits with banks was higher than the average for the quarter indicating further negative impact on the margin in the fourth quarter, but a slight positive impact on net interest income. The additional accrual day in the quarter contributed to 1 basis point to the compression. The remainder of the margin compression is attributable to the impact of new loans coming on at rates lower than those maturing as well as the lower impact from ancillary items such as interest from the repayment of non-accrual loans and recapture of deferred loan fees which in aggregate were somewhat lower than we would typically expect.","Our outlook for future core margin compression is about 4 basis points per quarter. ","Average loans increased by $420 million or 3% annualized compared with the prior quarter. On that same basis average commercial and industrial loans were down on an annualized 2% reflecting the usual seasonal contraction of loans to auto dealers to finance the inventories. Average commercial real estate loans increased by about 5% annualized reflecting an improvement from the sluggish growth in the first half of the year. The improvement was driven by both a higher level of originations as well as lower pay downs on existing loans.","Our residential mortgage loan volumes declined an annualized 5% reflecting the natural pace of principal amortization of the portfolio that the held for sale pipeline was flat. And average consumer loans grew an annualized 10% reflecting growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans. Overall end of period loans grew 5% annualized as softness in July and August was overcome by stronger results in September. We will expect the seasonal recovery in floor plan activity to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter. ","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased an annualized 7% from the second quarter, reflecting the elevated level of trust deposits I referenced earlier.","Turning to non interest income, non interest income totaled $451 million in the third quarter compared with $456 million in the prior quarter. There were no securities gains or losses in either period. Mortgage banking revenues were $94 million in the third quarter compared with $96 million in the prior quarter, lower revenues associated with loans sales activities were partially offset by $4 million increase in servicing income. Commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale declined by about 3% while the gain on sale margins was effectively unchanged. The pipeline for mortgage loan applications was down at the end of the quarter.","Fee income from deposit service charges provided were $110 million during the third quarter compared with $107 million in the linked quarter reflecting higher levels of customer activity. Trust and investment revenues which include fees from wealth management and institutional trust services were $129 million compared with $130 million in the prior quarter; a $4 million decline in seasonal tax preparation fees from the second quarter was mostly offset by new business.","Credit related fees which are included in other revenues from operations were impacted by the soft lending environment early in the quarter and were down by $5 million from what was a comparatively strong second quarter. ","Turing to expenses, operating expenses for the third quarter which excluded expenses from the amortization of intangible assets were $672 million unchanged from the prior quarter. Salary and benefits were $349 million up $9 million from $340 million in the second quarter, about $5 million of the increase came from one additional compensation day in the quarter. The remainder of the increase related to higher BSA\/AML staffing as well as higher incentive compensation.","Other cost of operation declined by $7 million from the previous quarter. Legal expenses decline from the second quarter which included $12 million addition to the litigation reserve, professional services including outside consultants were flat quarter-over-quarter. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization 59.7% for the third quarter compared with 59.4% in the prior quarter.","The next list, turn to credit. Credit quality remained strong and in line with our expectations. Nonaccrual loans declined further from the end of the second quarter, that ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined by 7 basis points to 1.29% as of the end of the third quarter. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $28 million, $1 million lower than in the second quarter and annualized net charge-offs, as a percent of total loans, were 17 basis points for the third quarter improved slightly from 18 basis points in the previous quarter. The revision for credit losses was $29 million for the recent quarter, and the allowance for credit losses was $919 million amounting to 1.40% of the total loans as of end of September.","The loan loss allowance as of September 30 was 7.7 times year-to-date annualized net charge-offs. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continued to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at the acquisition, were $313 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $265 million or 85% are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital, M&T's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 9.77% at the end of September, up 14 basis points from 9.64% at the end of the June. Our estimated common Tier 1 ratio under the recently adopted Basel III capital rules is approximately 9.52%. Turning to the outlook, as is our usual practice we will update you on our outlook for 2015 on the January call. However we have a limited number of observations regarding the reminder of 2014 while our view of loan growth is largely unchanged, lending environment remains very difficult particularly on the commercial side. Where we primarily had been seeing pressure on rates and spreads, we are also now beginning to see further relaxation of structures including longer loan tenures, lower cap rates, and a limited or non- recourse and personal guarantees all of which tends to keep us on the side line.","We were pleased with our progress for the plans during the quarter with the rules for implementation of liquidity coverage ratio now finalized we will be opportunistic in completing any remaining build out of our liquid asset buffer before the end of 2015. We expect continued core margin pressure of about 4 basis points as we enter into the fourth quarter and addition to full quarter impact of the actions we took in the third quarter towards the LCR compliance combined with higher end of period trust deposits held at the Fed will further reduce the margin but not net interest income.","We remain focused closely on investing in our infrastructure with an eye toward improving our efficiency ratio in the longer term once the pace of those investments begin to trend downward. Since early in 2013, M&T has been working due diligently to address the concern identified by the Federal Reserve with regard to a M&T BSA\/AML and other compliance initiatives and we are very much on track with the expenditure trajectory that we outlined for you back in January of this year and that elevated spending has produced good results.","We have made significant progress in-lined with the plans and milestones that we set for ourselves. Of course as you are aware of our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national, regional economic, growth changes in interest rates, political events, another micro economic factors which made different materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open the call to question before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Good morning Don. Ren\u00e9 I guess, can you let us know I guess what are the milestones that you\u2019ve hit so far with BSA and AML and what are sort of the next big milestones that you have on the checklist?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, I think the way I think about it in terms of the BSA\/AML I mean there is a number of things that we have been able to achieve and as I said I think we are sort of on track with the commitments we have made. But to run through them you know first on the list was improving M&T's risk governance, our infrastructure, and then all of the training associated with our frontline employees.","Second was that we build a comprehensive risk rating model to better identify potential money laundering risk and that's been up and running since this spring and so there has been several months to kind of work the kinks out of there and show how that's working for all the new customers that we have on-boarded since those dates.","Third we have sort of begun a bank wide effort to update our customer information to better understand our customers and how they plan to use the product and services and we have made substantial progress there. Of course that has been going on for almost a year now, maybe just over a year. We have made some substantial progress there.","Fourth was we improved our process for monitoring and reporting suspicious activity reporting and then finally we have sort of implemented a review by a third party to sort of determine whether certain transactions undertaken in the past by our customers were properly identified and reported and of course that's ongoing.","So the way I would characterize it is that we really have made a lot of progress. We feel that we are on track with all the requirements that were outlined in the written agreement that and the plans that we conveyed to our regulators but having said that of course as is typical for these types of things, they take a long time and there is a fair amount of work that obviously would go on beyond the end of 2014 and 2015 to meet the full requirements but at the same time, we believe our progress to date has been substantial.","Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that and I guess thinking about what you need to do going forward and what's been done I think it mean in order to sort of talk with the Fed and say here we have made substantial compliance and for the Fed to say we can approve this Hudson City merger or not even other written agreement maybe something that required some more test work, maybe the third-party review something that they would need to see in order to do that or what are the other things that would \u2013 the Fed would need to see and I guess in your opinion to move things along with the Hudson City merger?","Donald J. MacLeod","So, Hudson city. So let me start out Brian, I know it's not your question but I have to start out by saying that how saddened we were by Ron's passing. He was very, very close to us. He was a good friend with lot of roots in Western New York and lot in common with us as is true of the existing management team at Hudson city. So I think that we are going to miss him greatly as well others I think.","But I mentioned that because as we think about what we did back last January, M&T and Hudson City mutually agreed to extend that period in which either party could sort of walk away from the transaction without a penalty and we did that extension all the way out to December 31 of this year and in doing that, what we were attempting to do by providing that sort of 12 month window in the discussions that we had between M&T and Hudson City was to ensure that we could provide enough time to show that we could make this substantial progress that we are talking about, that we\u2019ve talked about today. And we also wanted to in addition to be able to show our commitment and we also though included in that thought process was that we needed to provide enough time for the various regulators to come in and take a look at what was being done and to also at that point in time, consider whether M&T was in the right condition to be able to proceed with any sort of transaction.","So all we can really say is that there is nothing sort of in the timeline that we kind of that has surprised us. We think we\u2019ve met all our milestones in that process and at the point where we are sitting here today I guess we sort of always envisioned that we were going to be \u2013 there was very \u2013 we still wouldn't be able on the October call to be able to provide any clarity other than the fact that whether or not we have done what we tried to do and we have done that. And so I think what has to happen is you just have to let that process take its course and give the regulators time to make their assessments and do what they feel is appropriate thing to do. But we feel good about the work we have done. That's sort of the best I can share with you.","Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. That\u2019s is very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Thank you. Rene you talked about mortgage banking revenues and some of the items that flow through again this quarter. If you would just help clarify I mean you look at the sequential comparison certainly I think you have talked about the $4 million in servicing income I think that was incremental compared to last quarter, but I thought last quarter\u2019s mortgage banking revenues were elevated because you had gains on the sale of three portfolios of performing loan and still when we look at Q2 to Q3, level of mortgage banking revenue is relatively flat and it looks like the servicing only contributed an incremental $4 million. So were there any other items that also kept the level of mortgage banking revenues elevated, you mentioned a few of them if you could just help clarify that would be great?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think \u2013 I am just looking for the numbers. I don\u2019t have that on my finger tips but I mean off the top of my head, one of the things I would say is that commercial held up very nicely in the quarter. Let me see if I can just grab a number on the commercial gain on sales. Yes, the commercial business which Fannie and Freddie business was up $2 million, but other than that no I think what was interesting is that the volume was probably little stronger than I thought it would be and that sort of offset the decline that I was also probably expecting on a linked quarter basis.","And having said that\u2019s sort of why I mentioned the applications, applications were down a bit about 9% in our pipeline which is really consisting of applications that haven\u2019t made all the way through the processes, was down about 18%. So I do think there is still little bit of downward pressure that we would be logical to see as we move into the fourth quarter but no it held up pretty well and it was real core business.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That is helpful insight. And the other question was I know you talked about this again in your prepared comments but if could just help me understand the flow of funds in terms of the interest bearing deposits, it sounds like you had some institutional trust money that came through and so your deposits grew sequentially and that money was deposited with the Federal Reserve and can you just help me understand how that tends to work again is that drawn short notice and then you again have to withdraw those funds out from where you deposited them I mean just the flow of the funds would be helpful and how that particularly works?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So the larger size deposits that we have been taking as I mentioned relate to our institutional trust business and then in many cases we are serving as escrow agents and then \u2013 in the case of this quarter, a number of folks who were doing M&A transactions have deposited money with us that we hold until those transactions go through approval in some cases that's the various regulators, the justice department and so forth. At times we have those types of transactions due to our trust duties which tend to be relatively short term. In this case they were little longer as much as six months because of the nature of those transactions.","And so given where we are now where we have got more deposits because of the \u2013 quite frankly us but also the industry has just flushed with the excess liquidity that exists nationally there is no really use for that. We put it aside and it goes into the Fed and we earn interest income but it tends to dampen a bit of our tangible ratio and it of course dampens the printed net interest margin. So it's just service that we provide for our good, strong trust customers.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That's very helpful and just my last question was touching, going to touch on the floor plan commentary and lending dealer floor plan lending and I think you had suggested that seasonally balance tend to be lower in Q3 and you see seasonal increase again in Q4. And what I was wondering is when you look at this business, what do you see when you hear about lot of optimism that dealers tend to have and it certainly seems like floor plan lenders aren\u2019t concerned and I was curious because you tend to underwrite conservatively if you had any changes to your underwriting standards or lending criteria as far as floor plan lending goes, especially like some of the concerns about auto lending really across the board. So if you could address that that would be helpful? Thank you.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Sure. Sure. I will start with the little bit of history. So we entered the auto was in 1950 and if I can remember, Don you might have to help me out but the first time we lost the dollars through charge outs was in maybe 2005, it was before the down turn in the economy and at that point in time, what I think was changing was structural thing in the industry where for the previous 50 years what would happen is floor plan there was a lot of support by the manufacturers. So somebody got into trouble, they would take them out. And they stopped taking them out as course of the manufacturers got into their own problems of course and frankly before the crisis started but we went through a pretty exhausted process at that time and the thing that we sort of concluded throughout our footprint was that there was a lot of difficulty with anybody who had a single flag and so if you were unable to have multiple brands it was going to be much more difficult to do.","So we went through a pretty exhausted process in 2005 and 2006 which positioned us relatively well. Then during the crisis, what you saw was a massive amount of consolidation in that process. So you are actually dealing I believe with a significantly lower volume of dealerships who are much, much stronger than they ever were in the past. And that's how you are entering the process. So then today they are benefiting because car sales are going up nationally and my sense although I haven\u2019t looked at it recently, but I would suggest those guys are probably stronger than they ever have been in the past because they are not really depended upon sort of this big brother backing that existed for the sort of \u2013 for the early years, early goal, so as I have talked to customers during that space and the RMs that deal with them, things look pretty good. The underwriting damage have not diminished significantly there. It's competitive like any other place. But quite frankly, in that space for us our relationships are really long. It's not like we are picking up a lot of new dealerships. I don't know that there are a lot of new dealerships. These are people we have done business with for quite some time. That's what I can tell you.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. That's very helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","Hi! Good morning everyone. I wanted to touch this a little bit more on Hudson city and sort of how we think about the milestones from here. I know you said you have sort of done what you expected to do in terms of hitting milestones and targets. Does that mean you all still hope to be able to close the deal by year end and were you all announced when the Fed sort of restarts the application review process?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well I think, I think, \u2013 I guess the way I think about it is I will stuck them at high level, I mean I talked to Don every week and other parties, talk to each other quite frequently. So we are both very, very committed to the transaction, all the economics are still there and it's an interesting thing that when you have this longer period to watch the portfolio that you are going to merge with, it gives you a significant amount of comfort above and beyond what typically, typically this takes in a lot faster pace.","But having said that, I mean all we are doing is working really hard. We are providing external folks like the regulators and everything they need to access our position. And we are just letting it play out. I don't think quite frankly enough time is passed for us to be able to answer your question on that. Having said that I mean as soon as we are to hear something in any direction it would be our responsibility to talk to you guys about it and to mention it.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","Okay. No that\u2019s helpful. And I mean it sounds like maybe the deadline is more formality than anything else and did all party seem committed and you guys continue move forward and do everything and it \u2013 I mean it doesn't sound like it's hard to stop. Is that fair?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Define hard to stop. ","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","As if December 31, has come and the deal has not been approved as if it would online somehow. ","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, it's been a long dance and we all still like each other. And quite frankly I have to say I mean what I feel bad about it, it's not difficult M&T to put somebody through a process like that. So I think our relationship is strong and we will have to see what happens.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","Fair enough. Fair enough. Shifting topics a little bit I know you pointed 4 basis points of margin compression sort of expectation heading into the fourth quarter, given where rates are today as you all look forward is that a good pace on sort of go forward basis through the foreseeable future until rates move higher or do you think that the pace of compression diminishes as we head through 2015?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. It's funny because this is the first quarter we look basis points by basis points of what\u2019s going on in the margin. This is the first quarter where we seem to be above our 2% to 3% about 4% compression. So, my sense is that's not going to go away. There is too much competitive pressure and too much pricing pressure out there for that to happen. When I look back, I mean I am pretty excited about the fact that our net interest margin this quarter versus \u2013 I am sorry, net interest income this quarter versus last year declined by $4 million bucks. So it's almost \u2013 just basically flat. And so I think that's been our trade off of trying to figure out how in terms of getting the right volume and serve our customer base, but do so in a way that doesn't result in too much margin compression. So I feel like I did almost the decade ago where we were saying look if you are going to see large growth in volume, you are going to see margin compression. And so my sense is that we didn\u2019t change our outlook because that sort of mid single digit 5% growth is probably what's reasonable and if we stay there I think margin compression probably stays where it is. I don't see it getting less.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","Fair. And would the thought process be there that you can continue to sort of hold the net interest income I mean if margin goes down or any asset go up and flattish on the net interest income line?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I don't know I mean it's not like when I look at my volume that we are not getting decent spreads and we are \u2013 we are getting decent spreads, we are getting decent returns, we measure economic problems. So, all the volume that we did which was about $2.2 billion of new commitments that went through our senior loan committee was done at very strong economic profits. So that's kind of the way I think about it. I guess the other thing I would say Bob is that I don't think you see a change in the competitive environment until some of the liquidity is taken out of the system. It's just too much money, everybody is available, everybody is healthy. In some cases, probably some of the regions where have seen most competition, one of the most interesting observations that was made in preparing for the call by one of some of our relationship managers involved in was that we had a number of credits actually that were in our catalog that were taken out. And that always kind of gives you some interesting sense of how competitive it is but it's not as if the revenue go trends or devoid from what's happening on the credit side. And my sense is that this will be one of those times where things will be slower and revenue goes tight as they always are and my job is sort of maintain our discipline so that we do well in the next cycle.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","Great. And then last question around the margin hop out, but did I understand you correctly that it's sort of 4 basis points sort of core compression and then the liquidity which doesn't have the same impact on the interest rate as the liquidity could actually drive a little more compression on top of that or was the 4 all end including the liquidity expectation?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No, the four was on its own and then the liquidity impact would be further compression and the reason I have been talking about it that way is because at least today in this year that liquidity has added a little bit to net interest income as we look to 2015 I have got to re assess whether the remainder of what we do on liquidity coverage ratio is neutral or negative or at where it is and I think I might change the way I talk about. Right now that's the best way for you to understand sort of what\u2019s going to happen with the dollars of revenue.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you Rene.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Hey Rene. How are you doing? Rene can I ask you a couple of questions on the expense side you mentioned all the progress you have been making with the compliance side, pieces we are still obviously seeing an increase on the salary side and but yet we start to see a little bit of decrease on the other expense side. Can you walk us through where you are in that hiring and consulting spend, we are still escalating from here, have we peeked or we actually turned the corner?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I kind of feel like we are at the top end as it relates to hiring for BSA\/AML as I look at the projection I mean we were I think last call I said we had done \u2013 we had like 571 or 572 individuals. That number this quarter is 613, but as I look at the projection I think we are fully staffed in my mind and on the professional services as you saw that didn\u2019t change. I mean that was you know it was exactly the same numbers it was last quarter and I think that's going to \u2013 I know that that\u2019s going to stay around for a little while longer because we have got work and volume to get through particularly on the fact that we got to get through the customer information and we use the term remediation, but really getting customer information on all of our customers. So not just the high risk ones we then we got to get on the medium risk and the lower risk customers. So I have all got to go through sort of refresh of information. So I think that will be around for a little bit before we begin to see a taper off.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","So, are we on that point about the professional services, I\u2019m not sure where exactly we see that the other line was down about $7 million from $240 million to $233 million but in that you are saying that those kind of consulting cost have been stable within that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes it's in there. I am going to, Don tell me if I\u2019m not, I think we spent around $102 million on professional services and it\u2019s in that same line but then what you are seeing is you are seeing that the litigation reserve, you need another one so and really the expenses that we are placing that we are on the salary side with the extra day and then some hires.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Okay. So you are kind of saying on net and then do you have an understanding of just when that would start to roll like as we \u2013 I hear your point about we will kind of see it hang around for a while but as you get into some point next year, do you have a line of sight in terms of when we can finally actually see that trend down or do you anticipate these type of level carrying through all the 2015?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, as we hit each of the milestones which we have done lot of them, you are not going to need the level of external services and labor that we are doing today and I kind of talked about the idea that we are going to see this happen sort of through this year and that would sort of position us well as we get in 2015. So my sense is that as we are now sort of fully staffed with full time internal people, and as the work starts to get to completion, various completion stages, you will need less and less of external labor. We just have to tie in to ramp up the internal people and get fully qualified internal people. It was going to take too long for us to have made the significant progress that we wanted to make in the past 12 months. So we used the lot of external people to supplement in the internal.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Co.","Okay. I got it. Thanks Rene.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard S. Cassidy of RBC Capital Market.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning. I\u2019ve technical question regarding the Hudson city deal, do you officially have to reapply to the Federal Reserve to get that deal done?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean we had our same application that has been outstanding for the period and obviously this thing that you would need to do as balance sheet change and circumstances change. You got to make sure that constantly you always have the right up-to-date current information available to the Fed. That's I mean pretty straight forward.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","How about again just on a technical basis here, what pace that application that's sitting at the Fed to the meeting that they will have at some day in the future to vote to approve or disapprove? What's the catalyst that puts it in front of them on the agenda to vote?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","All I can say is from my years of experience on \u2013 you basically when you have an application and there are number of steps, some of the most important steps are making sure that each institution from a supervisory perspective there is a very strong understanding of where those institutions are from a supervisory perspective and that's sort of the standard protocol that goes on in I think almost written in is BSA\/AML and that's why we are sort of in this situation. So the supervisory teams have to do a full assessment and make sure they understand where you are and then everything else is relatively standard in an application process. So we are really focused on particularly making sure that we all get a clear picture of where both firms are from a supervisory perspective.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. I know this has probably putting the carpet for the horse but from the sounds of what you have done for BSA\/AML the amount of money you have invested, the people and so on, you are probably going to be defined as best in class by the regulators after this process is completed. If you agree with that does that give you an advantage in a year or two should acquisition activity pick up again of sizable banks that you may be able to convince the potential seller that you can get the deal done to spend all \u2013 invest all the money into BSA\/AML?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. No. look I think actually \u2013 couple of things are \u2013 I will restate a couple of things. We know what happens this fall we are not done with the work that we need to do. We are under a written agreement. It will take a long time to get out from that written agreement and what we are dealing with today in terms of the topic you are talking about is this really a unique and special circumstance. Our focus is really on continuing to build up that infrastructure and I can't \u2013 I mean, I think you can get this from other institutions as well but I can't express to you the amount of change that has gone on in the regulatory environment in particular as I look forward around information, information management structure of the data, and that is stuff that we will continue to make investments on to make sure that we sort of have this \u2013 sort of renewed focus on our restructure and our capabilities to manage risk.","And my sense is that when we are done, we will look a lot different than we looked five years ago and we looked three years ago. And so I don't think that anywhere in our discussion is M&A and all that kind of stuff. We are very focused on the topic on hand and I think what we are dealing with right now is unique. We have got lot of work to do to demonstrate that we can sort of maintain our restructure.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Turning back to more on a day-to-day business side, you talked about some of the underwriting standards now are being stretched. Two part question. Could you compare this period of underwriting to a prior period when you looked back over the last ten years what would be the similar time period would you say and second is there any geographies that you are finding it more intense as you mentioned New York versus Baltimore versus Upstate New York tougher?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So okay. So what's similar now to say 2004 would be the amount of liquidity in the system enhanced by the Fed that there is no capital in the system as well. And that's similar. I mean if you remember when we were talking about then we are talking about the fact that it was really easy to raise money for hedge fund because everybody had all this excess cash that they couldn't find anywhere to invest because rights were low. That feels identical. I think what\u2019s a little different though is sort of when I look at the underlying economies that we serve I don't think it's clear that those economies are as strong. So when I flip through the largest credits in our non-performing book I do not see one area. I see cuts across whether it would be people that are in the refining business, manufacturing business, baked goods, where you can run \u2013 I just did this yesterday, you run down its cuts across the economy so I don't think that there is as much underlying economic strength as we probably felt when we were back at that time. The good news is that what we are hearing is that sort of several of our regions are suggesting that the actual \u2013 there is a slowly improving underlying economic condition and we are hearing that almost across each of the footprint.","The down side is for us is that people are stretching on terms, they are stretching on particular stuff deal structures and the one of that strikes me the most is that when we are stretching out going past ten years, or going out to ten years in terms of term structure. And particularly if you think about the idea that there is huge amounts of liquidity in the system, indirectly that means that asset prices are very, very high. And if that liquidity were to not be around, you start to wonder about looking at deals with the ten year structure and really whether they can sustain those higher rates and so forth. Upstate New York has been a wonderful place to be back then when they used to ask me well all your growth must be coming out of Baltimore because there is nothing going on in Buffalo, that is not true. That's a more stronger growth.","We saw like 6% growth linked quarter annualized linked quarter there and in the New York city metropolitan area we saw 9% growth but as you get down to Baltimore that was very competitive. And so was Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is talking about the economy improving in the lot of different places but that the lending available is pretty in terms of place that\u2019s sort of outside of our capabilities. To give you a sense we had one transaction which we lost which is an existing customer. It was priced at LIBOR plus 70 basis points and it was 15 year commitment which will be so far under water even before you consider the expenses in the efforts of the RM this doesn't make sense. So some days are similar, I think but that's the best I think I can tell you. We are watching it very closely though.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Just final question regarding your comment about reviewing your non-performing credit shift across the broad swap of the economy, would you say that those credits have been on the list for a fair amount of time or is that you are seeing this broad swap of new non-performers that maybe changing from what you just said from the guys in the field same thing seem to be getting better. Are these credits have just been sitting there and you\u2019ve been working on for 12 or 18 months to try to get them into performing standards?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Last year I would have said we have seen a lot of term new stuff going in, old stuff going out. This year I think we are seeing improvements. So the credits are they are \u2013 and quite frankly, the majority of them are actually paying. So we are receiving interests payments under the terms, it's just that they weren\u2019t in the original terms. And then a small subset but it's always sort of helpful to kind of look at where they sit. And again a couple of years back, obviously they would have been for us in residential development and that stuff from \u2013 in those portfolios but now it's more evenly spread across the various economy.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Thank you. I appreciate all the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Jeffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","On the liquidity coverage ratio, what you sound on that now?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, we made a lot of progress essentially what's difficult about the talking about the ratio is that if you were looking at balance sheet for the rules and get through all that, I mean we are pretty much there but we tend to take maybe a little bit more of a conservative view. We throw out the cash, large cash balances and those things and I think we are sort of what I would characterize is as we do that more conservative view we are in striking distance. I think we are doing that with basically five more quarters to go. The only reason we haven\u2019t really closed that out is because we have some time to be opportunistic about the types of paper we are buying and to do that maybe over little longer period. But that's the best way I can characterize it.","Jeffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","When you say you are pretty much there on the phase in 90% throughout the \u2013","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes that's the way to think about it. The phase in 90% the estimate and the proposal was 80, that's now been moved out a year and moved to 90. So we are all in striking distance of all that where we intend to be and again that's we are taking a very conservative view. We are not counting large amounts, large amounts of the cash that we have sitting on for institutional type things and so forth.","Jeffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Good evening. So, you\u2019ve announced and discussed kind of the organic plants you got around business banking and commercial lending in New Jersey, would you say that you are kind of own track with what you would have been doing had Hudson city acquisition closed say six or 12 months ago or do you think that you are kind of ahead of pace or different pace for much little while have been doing on the commercial side in New Jersey?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I would say we are definitely on track, we are probably ahead and there is always in adversity right, one of the things that I think we learned we were really impressed at how much progress the team could make and how the circumstances sort of forced the team to work more closely together to provide a full service to the relationship so we did all the stuff without branches. So we think we have learned something there and all of that has been very positive, we are very, very pleased with what the team has done in New Jersey and I would say it's ahead of pace from the original schedule that we had planned.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then I guess can we talk about maybe this is premature, but I guess there is some anticipations to be remixing the Hudson city residential mortgages into your commercial loans from this perspective is there a time line change or your ability to scale up New Jersey markets do that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. No. It's ahead of the original plan despite the fact that we did \u2013 there has been delay. So that's gone really well. And quite frankly, if I were to think about how you do this I think I remember talking back then about how that works when you go into a market a lot of times as you try to build relationships you get a little bit more business on the CRE side but I don't think that's really the case. I think we have done nice job on both CRE middle market, business banking as well, and the business banking in particular is impressive when you don't have a branch network.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Don MacLeod of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Paula, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T Bank's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call both by telephone and through the webcast.","If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules, from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you, Don. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today.","As we noted in the press release, this year's second quarter financial results reflects strong performance across most of our business. I'll share the details on these in a moment, but let me begin by reviewing the highlights, after which, Don and I will take your questions.","Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.71 in the second quarter of 2012, up 14% from the $1.50 earned in this year's first quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $233 million, up 13% from $206 million in the linked quarter.","For the purpose of comparison, recall that last year's second quarter marked the acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation, and as such, those results included several items related to the merger. Looking back, those items included $67 million of after-tax security gains amounting to $0.54 per common share, which was a result repositioning our securities portfolio in connection with the merger in May 2011. Also, included in GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2011 was a $42 million net after-tax merger-related gain amounting to $0.33 per share. Finally, last year's second quarter included a net $9 million or $0.07 per common share after-tax impact related to our purchase of $370 million of TARP preferred stock that M&T had previously issued to the United States Department of the Treasury. That purchase resulted in the partial acceleration of the amortization of the discount on that preferred stock, which was reflected as a net after-tax $9-million decrease in our net income available to common shareholders.","Reflecting those items, diluted GAAP earnings per common share for last year's second quarter were $2.42 per share, and net income was $322 million.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangibles, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisition activity.","Included in GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were merger-related expenses attributable to the Wilmington Trust acquisition amounting to $4 million after-tax or $0.03 per common share. This compares with $2 million after-tax or $0.01 per common share in the first quarter. GAAP earnings in last year's second quarter included a $42-million after-tax net merger-related gain.","After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $10 million or $0.08 per common share in the recent quarter, unchanged from the first quarter. After-tax amortization expense was $9 million or $0.07 per common share in last year's second quarter.","M&T's net operating income for the second quarter of 2012, which as noted, excludes only the merger-related gains and expenses and the intangible amortization, was $247 million, up from $218 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $1.82 for the recent quarter compared with $1.59 in the linked quarter. Net operating income, expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity -- shareholders equity, was 1.30% and 18.54%, respectively, for the recent quarter, improved from 1.18% and 16.79% in the first quarter of 2012.","In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and the income statement. Tax equivalent net interest income was $655 million for the second quarter of 2012, up $28 million from $627 million in the prior quarter. As required by GAAP, we regularly revisit cash flow projections on which we base our valuations of acquired loans. In general, based on stabilizing economic conditions and our success at restructuring several large acquired loans, our estimated cash flows to be generated by acquired loans have increased about -- by about 1%. Those increases led us to recognize about $14 million of additional interest income last quarter on our $7 billion portfolio of acquired loans.","Certainly, as acquired loans repay and that portfolio reduces in size in future periods, the dollar amount of interest income earned on acquired loans will also reduce but we -- what we estimate that the incremental impact in each of the last 2 quarters of 2012 should remain at about $13 million to $14 million -- at the $13 million to $14 million level. Notably, lower than expected cash flows on loans must be reserved for immediately.","Reflecting those improved cash flows, the net interest margin expanded during the second quarter increasing to 3.74%, up from 3.69% in the first quarter. Major items impacting the comparison with the linked quarter as -- are as follows: The $14 million increase in net interest income on acquired loans that I just noted added 8 basis points to the margin this quarter. Cash basis interest received on loans previously classified as non-accruing, combined with the slightly higher level of prepayment fees, was $7 million higher in the recent quarter as compared with the prior quarter. More than half of the increase came as a result of one large non-accrual loan being fully repaid. This had a positive impact on the margin of approximately 4 basis points.","During the second quarter, we again experienced large inflows of temporary trust deposits, which arose from customer funds held in escrow in connection with a bond issuance and the merger transaction. Where possible, we used that cash to pay down discretionary borrowings, but the net impact was a $981-million increase in the average cash balances that we held at the Federal Reserve. The low yield on those higher deposits at the Federal -- Fed reduced the margin by an estimated 5 basis points during the quarter.","Cash held at the Fed returned to a more normal level by the end of the quarter. Core banking activities reflected slight compression in the margin with new loans coming on at yields lower than those already on the books, and this has largely been offset by lower deposit rates and a higher portion of non-interest-bearing deposits. The net impact for the quarter was approximately -- was an approximate 2-basis-point reduction. I'll discuss our outlook for the margin in a few moments.","As for the balance sheet, average loan growth in the second quarter was strong, increasing by approximately $1.3 billion or an annualized 9% to $61.8 billion. On that same basis, compared with 2012's first quarter, changes in average loans by category were as follows: Commercial and industrial loans grew by $372 million or an annualized 10%. Commercial real estate loans grew by $178 million or an annualized 3%. Residential real estate loans were up by $930 million, reflecting our program of retaining the bulk of our conforming mortgage loan originations to hold on our balance sheet. Consumer loans declined an annualized 5%, driven by lower-end direct auto loans and modestly lower home equity loans and lines of credit. This was partially offset by a 7% annualized growth in all other consumer loans, primarily recreation finance.","On an end-of-period basis, loans grew $1.9 billion or an annualized 13% compared with the linked quarter. Included in this figure was 12% annualized growth for C&I loans and 7% annualized growth for the CRE loans, which sets us up nicely as we enter the third quarter. Average investment securities continue to decline as our appetite for purchasing securities remained low in the second quarter based on the low yields available. Instead, we continued with our program to retain residential mortgage loan production.","Looking to deposits on the deposit side, average core customer deposits, which exclude foreign deposits and CDs greater than $250,000 were up an annualized 18%, reflecting the large inflows of temporary trust deposits that I mentioned previously. As a result, as noted, M&T's average interest-bearing deposits at the Fed increased by approximately $1 billion compared with the first quarter. The majority of the increase was paid out by the end of the quarter. Thus, on an end-of-period basis, core deposits increased an annualized 14%.","We continued to benefit from the disruptions to consumers and businesses impacted by the HSBC branch divestiture in Upstate New York. Average loans in Upstate in Western New York -- in the Western New York region were up an annualized 8% compared to the linked quarter. That includes 18% annualized growth in commercial and industrial loans. Average core deposits in Upstate and Western New York region were up by an annualized 15% compared with the linked quarter, and up 12% compared with last year's second quarter.","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $392 million in the second quarter compared with $377 million in the prior quarter. The recent quarter results included $16 million of other than temporary impairment charges related to our investment securities portfolio compared with $11 million in the linked quarter. Excluding those charges from both periods, non-interest income was $408 million for the recent quarter, up 5% from $388 million in the first quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues rose to $70 million in the recent quarter compared with $56 million in the prior quarter. We saw increased levels of activity on both the commercial and the residential sides of our business. On the residential side so-called HARP 2 loans bolstered gains on -- gain on sale revenues from both a volume and a margin perspective.","Fee income from the deposit services provided, which include debit card interchange, were $111 million during the recent quarter compared with $109 million in the linked quarter. Trust revenues rose to $122 million in the recent quarter compared with $117 million in the prior quarter. Contributing to the increase were seasonal tax-preparation-related-revenues and merger-related synergies as well as new business wins.","Turning to expenses. On operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $604 million for the second quarter. This compares to the $620 million in the first quarter, which includes $26 million of seasonally high -- the $620 million in the first quarter, which included $26 million of seasonally high compensation-related items. The seasonal factors returned to more normal levels in the second quarter.","The conversion of our trust systems to a single operating platform has been substantially completed. We expect no additional merger-related expenses related to Wilmington -- to the Wilmington Trust acquisition. We do expect continued realization of merger savings in the second half of 2012. The efficiency ratio, which excludes security gains and losses, as well as tangible amortization and merger-related gains and expenses, was 56.9% for the second quarter compared with 61.1% in the first quarter of 2012.","Next, let's turn to credit. Credit trends continued to show improvements. For example, non-accrual loans decreased to 1.54% of total loans at the end of the second quarter, down from 1.75% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter. Other nonperforming assets consisting of assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $116 million as of June 30, also down from $140 million as of March 31. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $52 million, up slightly from $48 million in the first quarter of 2012. And annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 34 basis points compared with 32 basis points in the linked quarter. The provision for credit losses was $60 million in the second quarter compared with $49 million in the linked quarter. The provision exceeded net charge-offs, and as a result, the allowance for credit losses increased to $917 million at the end of the second quarter. The increase in part reflects the $1.9 billion of loan growth that we saw during the quarter.","While the dollar amount of loan loss allowance increased, the ratio of allowance to credit losses to total loans declined slightly to 1.46% compared with 1.49% at the end of the linked quarter. The loan loss allowance as of June 30, 2012, was 4.5x annualized net charge-offs for the quarter.","We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well secured in the process of collection, which is to say, there is low risk of principal loss. Loans 90 days past due were $275 million at the end of the recent quarter, of those, 255 or 93% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Loans 90 days past due were $273 million at the end of the -- this year's first quarter, of which, a similar 93% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","Lastly, while we don't report criticized loan levels until our 10-Q is filed, we do expect another meaningful decrease in the second quarter.","M&T's estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio was 7.15% at the end of June, up from 7.04% at the end of March, and this reflects higher capital from retained earnings partially offset by a larger end-of-quarter balance sheet.","Lastly, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our general outlook. We expect the net interest margin to be fairly stable over the second half of 2012, with some slight downward pressure from lower yields on new loans, offset by lower costs on deposits and on other borrowings.","Overall, as we noted on both the January and April earnings conference calls, we continued to expect the full year net interest margin of 2012 to be modestly lower than the 3.73 reported for the full year of 2011.","Combined with the continued growth -- continued loan growth, we also continue to expect growth in net interest income throughout 2012. As a result of the stronger-than-expected mortgage banking activity over the past year, we are thinking about our internal targets for the retention of conforming residential mortgage loans. And we've already begun retaining a lower proportion of our 30-year fixed rate originations beginning in this year's third quarter. We would not expect our overall retention of mortgage loans to remain at current -- at the current elevated levels much beyond the end of 2012.","While pleased to see our efficiency ratio decline to 56.9% in the recent quarter, we do expect that expenses will continue to be well controlled through the remainder of the year. The conversion of Wilmington Trust systems is complete, and realizing the remaining merger synergies will serve to offset the continued pressure from new regulatory mandates. As we mentioned, we do not expect any additional merger-related expenses.","Credit continues to strengthen. We expect continued improvement in the non-accrual and criticized loan ratios, with charge-offs remaining stable. Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","I appreciate your patience. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which, Paula will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question from comes the line of Todd Hagerman of Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, Ren\u00e9, just in terms of the Wilmington Trust acquisition. First, you mentioned a couple of things on the trust revenue benefit this quarter. Could you give us a better sense just with some of the components, as I think about the legacy Wilmington, the private client business and in particular, like their corporate services business, how that may have contributive for some of the strength in the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I think that, for the most part, most of the businesses held up very, very well on a linked-quarter basis, and as I talked about, the largest portion of the increase then came from some tax services that we provide, tax-related services that we provide to our customers, and that tends to be seasonal fees. We also had a bit of a lift because as you bring together the 2 entities, particular things like the funds, as you merge the funds, you begin to get synergies on net revenues. So net of fees, you're paying to service providers. So those things helped. If you look into the business, we saw a little bit of an uptick in the retirement services space. We saw that the capital markets group was a little weaker, continued weakness is probably what I would say because there hasn't been much issuance. Having said that, I guess as I think about corporate America and I think about what's out there, there's a lot of pent-up demand for refinancings, and so I think down the road, that probably bodes pretty well for us. But that was slightly weaker than maybe where it typically would run given the capital markets. And then also, we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown in where the agent brought in on syndicated loans because, obviously, credit is working out better. So we have the engagements we have, but in terms of new business, I mean, that's slowing, which is probably a good sign for the rest of the business. But overall, we're on track. We're sort of above where we expected to be and that's nice, and I think things are going pretty well there.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then perhaps, if you could just give us a sense now with the integration complete and particularly, as I think about like the wealth management business and trust overall, could you give us just kind of the mix now, how that may have changed or how that, again, just generally breaks down as I think about private client, traditional trust, that sort of thing?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I guess at some point -- I'll break that up for you. I don't have it with me right now. In part because we don't really think about it in exactly that same way, right? So at some point, if we break out CCS, which is the largest portion of the revenues from wealth, when I think about the wealth, right, again, I think about what's going to happen on the wealth side as an addition to the existing customer base. Much of that growth is going to be coming from M&T's preexisting clients, right? So as we offer them services whether they be cash management, wealth transfer or helping them exit their business, we kind of think of them in that way. So in part, I tend to look at some of that as how we're doing on our commercial bank side, right, and how is that working with our private bank. So we don't really break it out separately that way. But things are pretty stable. I'd say that if you think that a year has passed, I think our marks are probably good for keeping the portfolio relatively stable, but we still have a lot of work to do in order to go out there and penetrate the M&T customer base.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. The only reason I asked is just to get it from a modeling standpoint with some of the seasonality in some of the businesses, just to get a better sense of the mix and how to think about it.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. At some point, I guess, we'll lay that out maybe in our Q or not, but I haven't done that yet, so...","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on the mortgage and the benefit this quarter, could -- was there any uptick at all in terms of the reps and warranties, some of what we're hearing from some of the other companies this quarter in terms...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","in terms of repurchase request?","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In terms of the number of requests, yes.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So the number of requests was relatively stable. If you remember, we had talked throughout last year and that we were somewhere around 25 to 35 requests. Last quarter, this quarter maybe we were somewhere around 36, 37 requests sort of at the higher end of that. But they still remain in check. Having said that, we're also concerned about the same sort of things that you saw, which is sort of changing behavior. We do our best, in fact, to be surprised, to reach out to the other parties to make sure we understand their pipelines, the things that are coming to us. But even with that, I would say, when you look at our Q, you'll see that we continued to set aside amounts either for make whole prices on loans, repurchase requests or reserves for future ones. So we're very cautiously looking at that stuff, and just because no one's called us, doesn't mean that we take the position that they won't.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. Can you disclose where that reserve position ended at the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","What we do is we keep disclosing how much we've charged in the quarter. I think, this quarter that was $10 million. Last quarter, it was $4 million. A year ago, it was about $10 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at the commercial real estate growth, which is really the opposite of what some of your peers are seeing. Can you talk about which geographies and industries are supplying this and maybe why your growth is stronger than peers?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","In commercial real estate?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes.,right.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I can talk a little bit about it. I mean, I think the growth is also kind of split between Philly, New York, Hudson Valley at about annualized growth of 5%. All of our Pennsylvania market saw about 2% annualized growth. And then in Baltimore, Washington, which includes Delaware, which is important, we're seeing about 4% growth. I mentioned this is important because you got to remember we've got he acquired portfolios underneath that are probably still running off, right? So one of the things that you saw in the addition of our move of stuff from non-accretable to accretable yield is simply the fact that in Delaware, we have higher prepayment fees than we probably initially thought. So that kind of gives you a sense that at least in the quarter that it's not really concentrated in one area. I would guess maybe part of the issue is that we probably still have less run-off in real estate because our book is pretty good, pretty clean.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then when you think about pricing, terms, LTVs, can you talk about how they trended over the last 6 months here and especially on LTVs. I know it's tough because it's a wide range, maybe several [ph] average -- the average LTVs have been trending?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Average LTVs have been trending. Well, we -- let me start by saying, we haven't seen a significant pressure. First of all, last quarter, I said that there wasn't much change in terms of pricing pressure over the last 6 months. This quarter, that continued and quite frankly, even though we had higher volume, our pricing and our ROEs held up very nicely. So I thought that was very impressive. As you know, we track every deal we do both in terms of margin but also in terms of a full P&L. What it tells me is that a lot of the business we're getting is not just loan business but it's probably the operating business as well, which is the only way that you can really get in this environment pretty strong internal ROEs on the business. So if that helps, my sense is that we're doing a nice job of capturing full relationships. The LTVs, I don't think have changed. And I would guess, if you think of our total book, it sits in the 60s in terms of loan to value on commercial real estate. That hasn't changed at all.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And how about terms, are terms extending at all in terms of duration?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We -- how do I say this? We could have increased volume by moving in that direction, but we chose not to do that. So not for us.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. But the industry has?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","You -- I don't know if it's a change, but there's a pocket of business out there that you can get if you wanted to change your standards. It doesn't make any sense for us to change our standards. So I don't know if that's a change, but when I look overall, I didn't see a big change this quarter from talking to everybody in terms of competitive pricing and competitive structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, I was just wondering, I guess, with the NIM guidance that you give of, again, still sticking to the modestly lower than the 3.73 in 2011. Obviously, the second quarter included the $14-million impact from the accelerated accretable yield. Now are you expecting -- maybe you can just remind me what you just said earlier about. You expect that same level of accelerated accretable yield to be in the numbers, so therefore, in your guidance for the margin for the second half of the year.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So let me think about it this way. So the way I would think about it is we said $14 million was in this quarter. I don't expect that to change significantly next quarter or the quarter after because that's real cash, right? And what you should know is that as you think about it over time, the number will come down because the loan book prepays, right? So you won't keep at that pace. But as I sort of look out just a last couple of quarters, we feel pretty confident that those cash projections will continue for that period of time, and then we'll have to give you better estimates as we move out.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just to make sure I understand it then, so in the first quarter 10-Q, you said you had about $81 million of accretable yield that went through NII, right? So total on all the acquired portfolios?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So that mean, there was $95 million in the second quarter if we use that $14 million of the increased cash flow impact?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think it was more -- I mean, I'm going to -- it might change to something more like $90 million, somewhere in that range, but you're pretty close.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question on the NIM guidance, thinking about opportunities in the second half of the year to maybe refinance some higher costs, CDs and then you've also got quite a bit of high-cost capital trust preferreds out there. So do you think about -- you have the $3-billion shelf you filed earlier in the second quarter. Is there a possibility of looking at trying to use that shelf to refinance some of those high-cost capital trust preferred as well?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I mean, the shelf is there because you got to have a shelf. In particular, we actually have to have a shelf technically because we have the TARP. So you got to have that. We did, for example, finance -- I should say, pay off about a $400 million borrowing of sub debt that was past disqualification, so it ran out of capital treatments so we prepaid it. And we have the opportunity to do things like that from some time so we did that, I think, beginning, I think it was July 1. So you have benefits from that. And then, ultimately, I think you've got it on the hybrids and all that. There's a lot room there, but I can't figure out the timing, all right, because it all has to go in sequence with whatever we end up doing with TARP and all the hybrids and the whole thing together. So I'm just not quite sure on timing, but as I look into the future, I have some benefit. That is not counted in my fact or those hybrids and those things are not counted when I think -- when I say I think our margin should be relatively stable for the second half of the year from where we are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little more color on the loan growth that you saw in the quarter, for example, how much of that consumer real estate growth was actual retention of the one for family originations? And then separately just a little more color on the commercial growth that you saw.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, so I'll have someone check that. I don't think our -- I think almost all of that growth was the -- was what we held for the portfolio as opposed to increases in the pipeline. But I can get that for you. And then, really, again, if you think about it, I mean, if I look overall, on the C&I side, we had really strong growth in Upstate New York, 18% compounded -- annualized growth, but it's kind of across the board, New York, Philadelphia, Tarrytown -- or Hudson Valley, we saw the same. Pennsylvania, we saw growth. We saw a slight decline in C&I in Baltimore, Washington, Delaware. I think part of that is the prepay on Delaware, but it's also we had the payout of a large non-performer that would have been in the Baltimore area, so those -- the declines are coming from a positive thing. And then I talked about commercial real estate. There is nothing concentrated about it. It's not in one segment. It's not just in auto. When you kind of listen to everybody across the regions, it comes from a multiple different types of businesses. I don't think it's a big change. It's actually up slightly from where we've been running. But I think year-over-year, we probably have very similar growth. So for example, we had almost 10% annualized growth in C&I, but on a year-over-year basis, we had 10% growth in C&I. So I think things are holding steady, but they're going pretty well.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then secondly, how much was your unamortized premium on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Unamortized premium.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. In your MBS portfolio, sorry.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I don't think -- I think I understand what you're saying. I don't think that concept applies. So let me say this, that if you were -- give me a second. Let me -- if you look at our loan yield, most of our loans prior to this quarter, our acquired loans were recorded at a premium as opposed to a discount. And just said another way, we had acquired loan yields were lower than our legacy coupon. So after making the change, it's changed slightly. So give me a second. I think what I'd say is that you saw that our loan yields were 4.42 for the quarter. I would say we're about 40 basis points or so higher than that. Oh, I'm sorry, are you asking about our MBS?","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, actually, I indicate on the MBS portfolio. I was interested in getting a gauge for your premium amortization expense.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Most of what we do or putting on the books is 101.3, right? So there's not a lot of prepayment risks in the sense that if it prepays, we end up just replacing them at very similar yields. I kind of didn't quite get what you were asking. The other thing to think about when you stay with that topic is that as you think about what's happening out there, we don't have some of the same risks as everybody else when you move to our securities book, which is MBS, because last year, we sold a couple of billion dollars of our securities book, and we sold most of the higher-yielding securities, right? So we have less concern about seeing high prepays that we couldn't replace.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, can you just give a little bit of color on the impact of the new Basel III NPR on your Tier 1 common ratio? What -- how much of a basis point impact that would bring about?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I got to tell you, we were looking at it -- we're looking at what all you guys are calculating. I think at some point beginning in next year, we'll probably have to publish it and put it on our Q as to what we think the impact is. But we really haven't finalized what our calculations are. I think at the end of the day, we'd rather be more certain than to do a speculative number there, but with the new NPR, we're beginning to do that. And I think by the beginning of or end of this year, beginning of next year, we'll be publishing something. Whatever we publish though, I think, will -- doesn't really reflect the fact that of anything that we'd be able to do to mitigate the impact, right? So whether it'd be MSRs, whether it be the deferred tax position that we have or the types of loans that we have on our books, I mean, there's -- or securities, there's probably a lot that we can over time to mitigate whatever the impact will be. But we'll -- in about 6 months, we'll be disclosing that -- those numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So just coming back to the margin outlook, I think we're all clear now that the step-up from the accretion benefit, that kind of run rates. But what I want to try to understand is over time, obviously, that benefit will decline. Can you help us understand from the current run rate of all things acquired loans of this $90 million or so, what the pace of runoff would be over the next couple of years? Is it fairly ratable? Or is there a really long duration of these assets that will kind of keep it in somewhat extended out? Any color just on the kind of role and the duration would be helpful.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Let me give you a couple of things. So I'll try to make it as simple as possible, but I'll start with a caveat, which is we have to look at these things every quarter, and we look at all the cash flows. So barring any changes, generally, we talked about where we thought it would be for the next couple of quarters. It's a rough rule of thumb. I would say that the amount of change that would be in our numbers next year for 4 quarters would be equivalent to what we saw in the 3 quarters this year, give or take a few million dollars. And then it starts to run down further from there.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, Ren\u00e9, that the amount of change? Can you just -- that's...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, so we talked about a $14 million change, right? So -- and then we said that, that amount that we're adding is probably fairly similar in the next couple of quarters, right? So you take those 3 quarters and you get an amount. I would guess in the next year, 2013, our fourth quarter amount will be very similar to that amount, right? So it's coming down, but we've got 4 quarters instead of 3. And then from there, it continues and it's paced out, I mean, predicting it out many more years than 2013, I think, just probably doesn't make much sense.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So you're saying that -- so I'm sorry, that's still a little confusing. So you get 3x $14 million and stays, but then next year, you're basically saying that $42 million would be the whole year?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's probably -- I mean, I'm not giving you the $42 million, because I -- I mean, these are rough numbers, but generally yes, you've got the right concept, right?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it starts to drip down, and then it's fair to look at it as if that kind of drips down sort of by that proportion as we go forward?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, as loans pay off. So why I'm so cautious is the prepayments fees pick up the changes, right? If they slow down, it changes, and -- but that's generally what we have modeled to date as we sit here today.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. So it's not an incremental positive. It stays at this level for the next few quarters and then has a gradual roll over the next few years presuming that the book is prepaying as you kind of expect it. If in fact, it prepays faster, you can always redo the cash flows like you did this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, exactly, and it's because -- you got it exactly, Ken. And the reason that, that's the case is because we're talking about cash, right? So as those loans prepay, then the next question as we through analysis is did it pay on loans -- did we get paid on loans that we thought were impaired, is a good thing. Obviously, we get paid on loans that we thought were clean, right? So there's a lot of moving parts that come into it, but you've got the concept for it.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is if we just -- I heard your comments again about being able to hold up loan yields versus -- or the decline in loan yields would kind of track the ongoing decline and funding costs, again, for the next couple of quarters. I guess the question is how competitive is it on the loan side and then also how much room do you think you can continue to reduce deposit costs, again, in the out year in the next year couple -- next year or so.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","You know we tried to be very diligent in saying that we've got a couple of basis points of compression almost every quarter, right? So I think that there that exists in my sense is, is that as we ran out on the liability side of repricing, which we know we're getting pretty close, so beyond the 2 quarters, I think that's the number that I would throw out there that we're going to see a couple of basis points of slowly [ph] margin compression. You've heard the earlier question Brian Klock raised is -- well then the question is can you refinance anything else in terms of hybrids and those types of things. We haven't thought about that. It's too far away to think of it.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So when I bring it all together, we'll have a natural decline in accretable, in the accretion benefit over time, and then there's this -- and unfortunately, with the rate environment, there'll just be a little bit of a drip on the core as well?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I think that's right. And the thing I keep in mind as you think about revisiting acquired loans, I mean, I was about to say earlier when I was on the wrong topic that if you look at our loan yield today 4.42, I think, they were, we're about 30, 40 basis points higher now on the acquired book. But I think the biggest book is Wilmington, and on the Wilmington-acquired loans, I think our yield is roughly 4.44. So again, we don't have a lot of replacement risk there, right, which is a real positive thing. And quite frankly, if there's any change in the rate environment, right, we probably can replace those at higher margins, higher yield end margin, right? For where you take in the funding cost side. So with no change, I think, you've described the state of affairs, which is basically no change in the rate environment, no change in anything, but we're always trying to position ourselves to make sure that we're okay in all rate environments, right?","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I'll start -- is the C&I loan growth the sign that the loan pie increased in the second quarter? Or is the market share gains particularly given a relatively large transaction in your backyard?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","The latter is true. We picked up a few more clients, but I think we've got -- the activity we see is a lot from our existing clients. I think the Upstate New York is a whole different thing, and that's where a lot of the growth came from. But in other markets, I'd say it's just a little more quiet out there. So again, it's not a big change. I mean, it feels a little stronger this quarter, but I would guess if you took away the Western New York parts of things that it wouldn't be. Don is pointing out to me that the usage in outstanding is up a little bit as well, right? So it seems like outside of Western New York is coming from more usage.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So despite even the macro backdrop, you're not seeing any signs yet of corporate borrowers getting more cautious?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","They're still cautious as far as I'm concerned. Cash balances are really high, and they just haven't changed, right?","Donald J. MacLeod","Yes, the reflection of caution yield, the deposit inflows, I think probably are a reflection of that.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And maybe, Ren\u00e9, where are we on the cost saves now with Wilmington? I know we have talked about $90 million to $100 million. Can you give us a sense what percentage is now in the run rate?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I'm going to guess and all -- everybody in the room is going to get queasy. I think it's around 16%. I think, we'll be around 20%. And I think you'll see in the second half, I can't -- really I think -- I think we'll see some benefit next quarter, but I'm sure we'll see benefit in the next 2 quarters from the conversions and things that we've done and actions we've taken and then maybe a little bit after that. But if I were to guess, I'd say, we're at 16% now, and by the end of the year, we'll be maybe not quite at 20% but pretty getting close or 18%, something like that. But turned out pretty well.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And I just want to clarify, in your comments about retaining mortgages, did you say you plan to still retain in the second half but to a lower degree and then go back to selling fixed rate production in 2013?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So what we did is we, starting in the month of June, maybe even in the second half of the month, we decided to discontinue retaining a number of the 30-year programs. So we might have -- in the second quarter, I think the number's probably like -- about 63% of our production in the second quarter that we put on the books was above 20-year. And now we're on pace for that number of 30-year to be -- to go below 50. 20 -- 20 plus to go below 50 because we're discontinuing programs. I think we'll continue to do that. So the longer stuff will slow down by the time we get to near the end of the year, beginning of next year. I -- my guess is that what we'll be doing is using more 15-year-type paper and maybe 20-year paper to sort of replace runoff, right? But we had -- we started the program, I don't know, a year ago or so. It's -- we've had more volume than we thought we would get, right? And as I said all along, we only have so much appetite there. We really don't want to totally change the profile of our book, and we really only did this in part because we weren't taking on investment securities. So that's what I think will taper it off a little bit as we go, moving -- focusing on duration first and then volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask Steve's expense question another way. So I feel like because mortgage banking revenues are so strong. There are some distortion in terms of the dollar number. I guess, could you give us a sense of what you expect the efficiency ratio on your mortgage banking unit to run for the rest of the year? And separately, your expectation for the efficiency ratio for the rest of the Bank x mortgage banking?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","First of all, it's a great question. I don't know that I can answer the question because I would say whatever the efficiency ratio is of our book , which -- do we have it in the segment? I don't know if we have it in the segment either. It's just abnormally high today, right, because we've got a lot of volume coming on high margins, and you don't have the ability to ramp up your production enough, so it's abnormally high. So I think if you remove that or put it this way, what's happened really is we've got a nice benefit from mortgage banking, which will be somewhat short term. I don't know how long. But in the interim, we're going to have to really continue to focus on the expense side because of the core bank hasn't seen the full improvement yet that we need -- we probably need to see to sort of sustain a low to mid-50s efficiency ratio when the mortgage banking kind of subsides. But as you think about the Wilmington side, we're in pretty good position because we've got more expense savings that it will kind of flow in and the work is done. And the other thing, Erika, that I'd tell you is that in our expense space today is a fair amount of expense. I don't know how to characterize it. I don't want to say it's nonrecurring, but it's expenses related to gearing up for the new regulatory environment, whether it be consultants on -- that we use on capital policy or whether it be other expenses that we're using to sort of build out our new compliance structure and so forth, that over time, we'll settle down a bit. So even though you can kind of see when you look year-over-year -- and I think next quarter, you'll see year-over-year -- when you look, you'll be able to see the impact of Wilmington Trust. I think that there's still probably some room to at least to be able to sort of contain expense growth because our regulatory costs are high. One of the areas that's very high these days is professional services, right? And I think that's primarily because of all of the change that we're going through.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one last question. I know you've been asked the accretable question many ways in this call and I appreciate the color that you gave Ken. I'm just wondering did what happen in the quarter -- was that a reclassification from non-accretable to accretable, so the credit experience over the lifetime is better and that's why it's not a clipped [ph] vest? And if so, I guess clearly, the prepayment levels are going to be a big swing factor in terms of how much it drops off, but potentially if credit expectations continue to be better relative to the mark, you could just be refilling that accretable tank so to speak.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think everything you said the way you said it was true. So let me go back through. So first of all, yes, it was. After looking at the cash flows, we reclassified -- and this will be in our Q -- about $140 million from non-accretable, i.e. cash flows that were owed to us that we didn't expect to collect, we now expect to collect and were moved to accretable yields, right? And then -- and that comes from 3 factors. One, we worked out some deals in a more favorable way than we thought. The environment seems a little bit better but also because prepays are faster. Those aren't -- usually, those are pretty consistent in a sense, right? And so I think the last part is you never know. It depends on what happens to the economic environment, and if we see the current trends continue or continue to be more favorable than we've projected from now, yes, we could have more. And I think the way to think about it, again, is I point to the yields. I think, we've been doing that since we did the Provident acquisition, That's the way to look at this. That yield on the Wilmington Trust is almost spot on our -- what we're originating loans at today, basically, our legacy loans book. So that tells you that unlike most acquisitions you've seen in the past, those yields have been at a -- the loans have been booked at a significant discount. In our case, to the extent that we continue to see improved results even beyond what we see today, yes, there could be more, but it's hard to tell, right? The other thing I would point out is that to the extent that we look at any particular loan in our book and it goes the other way where the cash flows are worse, then we take that charge immediately into the provision. And we've done that over time. We had some of that this quarter as well, right? So it kind of goes both ways. But the accounting forces you to be conservative on the positive side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, a couple of quick ones I guess. How long -- you mentioned some benefit from the disruption in the Western New York market. I guess I'm curious as to how long you think that, that might provide an upside benefit to your loan growth. Is it a one quarter issue? Is it a 4 quarter issue? Is it -- how should we think about that?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I -- one, I really don't know. I only could assume that what's really happening is people are trying to settle in to the change that's happened in the marketplace, and that change is not just driven by the HSBC sale. It's driven by the physical conversions. You know that recently the names on the branches on -- another set of branches changed to KeyBank. And then if you go further to other places in Upstate New York, that's continuing to happen. So the best I could say is just through this year is people kind of settle in and try to figure out where they want to keep their lasting banking relationship.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on the provision. Given that you saw a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline in the NPA balances, it certainly sounds from the -- from your earlier comments that you're expecting credit quality to continue to get a little bit better, how should we think about the potential for reducing reserves over the next 2 to 3 quarters? Isn't that just driven by lower losses,  lower delinquencies? Or is there something else that you're adding to your analysis that makes you a bit more cautious?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think the first thing to look at is our -- the allowance to loans is coming down, right? So you see it there. So the inputs to the allowance are, yes, there's improving credit. I think in part that's somewhat offset by the loan -- what we need to add for the loan growth, so if loan growth subsided, that would be -- you might see something there. And the other piece is that as we look at the acquired loan book, while we have $140 million of cash flows that as Erica said, we moved from non-accretable to accretable, from time to time, we'll see credits that go the other way, right? That we'll have to add to the provision immediately. So those are the components. But if you look at it last year, this time, our allowance to loans was 155, we're down to 146, so it's a fairly -- I consider that a meaningful decline.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just one final quick question. You mentioned HARP 2.0 was a bit of a benefit to the mortgage business this quarter. What amount of your total originations this quarter were related to HARP 2.0?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Let me look for that number. I don't know the number. 57, and just to make sure, I think, I believe that number. so it -- well, let me give you the numbers. I mean, that's probably easier. So we originated new locks, which were a total of $1.7 billion, okay? Only $864 million went to Treasury, okay? So take those out. So if you think about the gain on sale, you just take the $1.7 billion. Take out the $864 million, and you're left with the total. $492 million of that was HARP, and I think that gets you to a 57% of what we're selling, okay? We sell all the HARP.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. But in terms of total -- but in terms of HARP relative to the total originations, it would be the roughly $500 million divided by the roughly $1.7 billion, correct?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to -- want to follow up on that reserve question. So you've indicated obviously that's a fairly meaningful drop to date. But I guess I'm looking at it maybe a little bit differently. And I heard you on the moving parts in terms of the non-accretable component and swings in that. But I guess if I look at it -- I mean, at the peak of the crisis, you guys saw losses. I mean, your losses peaked at 1%, so in my mind, it seems as if your reserve could go quite a bit lower especially given where we are in the overall cycle, economic cycle than where you stand now. I mean or are you suggesting that kind of keeping in this 145 level is where you're going to be?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","You always ask great questions. So first of all, I would characterize it differently. In a single year, we had 1% losses, right? And our job is to look at the losses inherent in our book that we can identify over time. And then to some extent, there's a portion that we might not be able to identify, right? So you can't use the 1-year loss estimate against the -- that process. I don't know, I guess if we continue to see the loan growth -- and I think there's going to be downward pressure on the allowance to loan levels. As we've seen, I don't see anything that's going to change it. I feel pretty good about the integrity of our process because the way I look at it, Collyn, is that the depth of the crisis, we had coverage of about 1.2% or something like -- actually, 1.5% of our charge-offs, 1.5x I should say, right? And so the idea that after the depths of a crisis, you're sitting there with a year's worth or a 1.5 years' worth of coverage, tells us that we did a pretty good job in our allowance methodology of identifying the risks that were inherent in the portfolio. I don't know how to think about it any different but...","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just on the resi Mortgage strategy, so when we think about kind of the funding of the growth at least for the back half of this year, is that going to come out of kind of your cash balances or your interest-bearing deposit balances? And then how should we think about the relationship between -- if we're not going to see growth in resi mortgages next year, does that mean we see -- start to see some growth on the MBS side? Or how are you thinking about it in totality?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Well, I think the way I look at it is -- first of all, straight answer, I think, we've been funding everything with deposits because deposit balances have been very high. As we look forward, I think that the underlying loan growth is not bad, right? I mean, look at the stats we gave you today. And then I think really we kind of hit our -- we're getting close to what we think is a natural limit on the amount of resi mortgages we have on hold. So I'm not sure that even if rates stay low, that we'll be able to sort of go -- jump in and start buying securities again. We'll have to look at that. I think to date, it's been a nice substitute, but I think we're just very cautious. We don't tend to put a lot of long duration on. I don't know, we're kind of nearing about $10 billion. We're getting closer to $10 billion in the resi books. And I just think the best way to think about it is we probably, for at least for now, maybe hitting our tolerance level. I don't know how to -- I think that's the best I could tell you.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. That's helpful. Okay. And then just 2 quick items. The -- did you say or do you have the number what the seasonal tax items were in that trust line?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, no, but it was about $3 million.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the $14 million in accretable yield that you saw, how did that break up between C&I and CRE?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think it's mostly CRE and because a lot of it's coming from Wilmington and actually Provident, right? I don't know the exact number but most of it is CRE.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the final question, did you say on the temporary trust deposits, was that - what was the dollar amount of those 2 that kind of inflowed in the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Absolute dollar amount was really high. The average was about just under $1 billion. But at one point, I think we peaked at like $4 billion during the quarter. Right. So you just got the -- but they were there for 30 days or something like that or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You just mentioned that you guys are getting close to the natural limit on the amount of resi mortgages you want on your balance sheet. How do you think about that limit? I mean, is there a percent of assets, a percent of earning assets? Kind of what factors into that decision? And then what is the yield at the margin on mortgage production today versus MBS that you might purchase?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yield on the margin -- well, I think I'll get that number for you, but somewhere in here, something like 380 was what we put on. Just give me a second. Let me find that. We put on -- well, I have to ask someone to find it for you, but I think it's somewhere in the high 3s in terms of -- yes, I'm looking at 360, somewhere around there. It's not too much change from where we were last quarter, so that's that. And then just give me the first part of your question again.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Well, in that 360, I guess, is on originated loans, how does that compare to mortgage-backed securities that you would be buying in the market?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We're not buying them. I don't know. We're not buying them, so they would -- I would guess, they'd be 50 basis points lower, but that's a guess. And to your other question on how we think about the natural limits, I mean, we look at a lot of things. We look at our asset sensitivity. We look at our duration and our exposure to any one class. We also think that about the profitability of those loans over long periods of time. And I don't know how to say it but I'd say that we're not reached any internal technical limit but we sort of [indiscernible] appetite today before putting it on pause, because remember for 20 or 30 years, we never retained mortgages, right? So we've moved the  position of debt. I think we're going to probably sit on it after a while and sort of see how it feels and watch the risk metrics and then go from there.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio, what is the CPR that you all are seeing on the portfolio you have today?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I don't know if someone has it, but I think we've -- it's been creeping up a bit. But the last quarter, maybe it was around 10%, not very high. And I think it might be in the low teens, maybe 12%, somewhere in that range. It's even at an annualized basis.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, that's slow [ph]. That's good.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","The new -- just so you know, the new 30-year MBS yields would be 250.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then in the mortgage backed, what were the gain on sale margins this quarter? And do you think, looking at it next quarter, they'll be more or less stable? And sort of how does the pipeline today look versus last quarter? Obviously, as you said, you'll all be selling more of whatever production there is.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, the gain on sale margins were relatively stable. We -- they move a little bit depending on the percentage that you have of HARP and the -- so in a sense, the actual number was higher because more of what we are actually selling is HARP, right? I don't know if I have the exact number. In total, the gain on sale, new losses, around 3%, right? And so that's definitely elevated because of HARP. I think, typically, we'd be lower 2s, maybe 2% if we were just talking about normal production.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then HARP presumably is going to still be a big piece next quarter as well, so would you expect it to be comparable?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Sure. I think it continues for the rest of this year. I mean, our pipeline was strong. So when I look at like applications, I don't see a big change in that mix. And then I look and say to myself -- I'll give you a couple of numbers. We had application volume -- this is sort of the front end of the process. It was up 23%, linked quarter. And then we track another thing which we call our mortgage pipeline, which is apps minus things that are denied, withdrawn or closed loans, so it's the purest sort of indicator of what's going on into next quarter, and that was up 26%. So there is really no pace, a slowing of pace, right, as we kind of go from second to third in my mind.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So it sounds like volumes should be stronger, the percent that you sell should be stronger and the margin should be stable. Is that fair?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, my guess it's a lot of moving parts in that business, but yes, I mean, I don't see a lot of things changing.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Great. Last question for you, the FDIC assessment expense was down pretty meaningfully this quarter. Any thoughts there? Is this quarter a good run rate? Or what drove the improvement?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It can be -- let me just say, asset mix and then we continue to try to think about ways in which we can change our behavior to make sure that we're optimizing that, and so our goal will be to focus on that number over time, whether it'd be on sort of looking at the amount of construction lending we've done or looking at how we -- making sure we're properly classifying loans and a whole host of other things. We look at it pretty closely. Again, I say it every time. We're the 90th percentile. That's not a good thing for us, so we're going to focus on that line.","Operator","Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question for you is in terms of the improvement in credit quality that you've seen and what you expect to hopefully see in the next 6 to 12 months, is there any particular asset class that's improving better than expected or faster than expected? And geographically, are there any parts of the footprint that are performing better?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I mean, we saw improvements -- most of the improvement I would say is in the commercial real estate space. So a slight improvement in C&I, but one of the things you're seeing, Gerard, is that I think it has a lot to do with the low rate environment. I think it's also very much akin to what we talked about on the acquired book, which is that we're finding that we're able to either restructure or work out transactions more favorably than we might have thought. And part of that is because other lenders or the markets are actually willing to sort of step in at the prices that we've got, sort of the non-performing loans on our books at this point. And so we're seeing a lot of these things work out. I'm not sure if there's a real change in the inherent risk as much as there's a change in the market and appetite for actually taking on these assets that now have been written down at pretty heavy discounts, right, which on the flip side with the low rate environment, one of the places you can go to find yields is on these projects that were stalled and failed in the past that have been written down. So a lot of it is in the commercial real estate space. Also, prepayments being higher, when you look at our net interest income, when you look at the prepayments being higher, it's very consistent with that same theme.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And speaking of credit quality, can you give us an update on the Bayview impairment? Where is it now? And how is it looking at this point?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think a basis on our balance sheet in Bayview is about 104, somewhere around 104, I guess. And then there's been no change. We don't -- we're not -- we don't have any great concern. I think that the Bayview Asset Management seems to be doing fairly well in this environment. And it's an environment where they have access to servicing portfolios, maybe without some of the burdens that some of the banks have. And they also have the ability to purchase assets and higher yields than you're getting out here in the low rate environment. So they seem to be doing very well and fine, no real change to anything there.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Final question on the funding side of the balance sheet, you may have touched on this and I apologize. In your CD book that you have, how does that reprice over the next 12 months? I think there's about $5.5 billion in that CD book that I think you just pointed out. It's about 90 basis points. That's what it's costing you. How does that reprice going forward over the next 12 to 18 months?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I look at the yields as I looked at them some time ago, but they seem to be down a couple of basis points in a very consistent flip [ph] every quarter. Let me just take a quick look at that again but...","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","There's no high rate -- so as you're looking for it, there's no real high rate falling down near that 3% or something that might reprice in the third [ph] quarter or anything?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. No, there's not -- oh, go ahead, Don.","Donald J. MacLeod","There are still some brokered CDs on the books from Wilmington, and there wasn't a lot of runoff this quarter, but there'll be a little more in the next 2 quarters.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Don, were they fairly -- are they priced fairly highly compared to the rest of the book?","Donald J. MacLeod","Yes, but not outrageous.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Think about it this way, Gerard. You say Provident, right?","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wilmington.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Wilmington, Provident, so you mark those, right? So a year ago for one, I think some of them are Provident, so that's 3 years ago. So you can look maybe to the Provident to see there's something. But as someone just pointed out to me, I mean most of -- the majority of our time deposits are within inside a year, so I think you're going to continue to see the same sort of steady trend that you've seen over the last several quarters.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one final question on this, on the funding cost, what environment -- considering that the Fed has pointed -- has stressed that this rate environment's going to stay this way through the end of '14 with the low end of the -- the short end of the curve close to 0 or at 0, and the long end of the curve currently is about 1.49%. Deposits for you and your peers are coming in quite strongly. What kind of environment do you need to see where the deposit costs actually go down to 5 or 10 basis points considering money market mutual funds today are paying one and 2 basis points? Do you guys -- can you envision an environment where the deposit costs for now accounts and savings accounts can fall to 2 or 3 basis points?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Never say never, but I hadn't really thought about it. I mean, even so, think about it this way. It doesn't give us that much boost. I think on now accounts we're at 7 basis points. In savings, we're at 18 basis points at the end of quarter. So I guess my answer is it seems like we're almost there now.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A session for today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations, please go ahead.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Maria and good morning. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website www.mtb.com and by clicking on the investor relations link.","Also before we start I\u2019d like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. As I\u2019m sure you noticed in this morning\u2019s press release, earnings were a bit soft relative to this year\u2019s second quarter as origination activity slowed in both our residential and commercial mortgage banking operations. In addition, credit costs were slightly higher coming off unusually low second quarter levels. That said, growth in net interest income and certain other revenue categories combined with well-controlled operating expenses which enabled us to maintain solid efficiency ratio, slightly improved from both last quarter and last year\u2019s third quarter.","As I\u2019m sure all of you are aware, our application to acquire Hudson City Bancorp was approved by the Federal Reserve on September 30th and by -- and subsequently by other regulators, and is set to close on November 1st.","We\u2019ll start out this morning by reviewing a few of the highlights from the recent quarter\u2019s results, after which we\u2019ll give you an update on our outlook for the merger and its benefits to M&T; then Don and I will be happy to take your questions.","Turning to the results, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.93 for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $1.98 in the second quarter and up from $1.91 in the third quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $280 million compared with $287 million in the linked quarter and $275 million in the year ago quarter.","Recall that in this year\u2019s second quarter in connection with the divestiture of Wilmington Trust\u2019s trade processing business we recorded a pretax gain of $45 million while operating expenses included $40 million in contributions to the M&T charitable foundation. Taken together, the two items reduced net income by about $1 million or $0.01 per common share.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $3 million or $0.02 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $4 million and $0.03 per common share in the second quarter. M&T\u2019s net operating income for the third quarter which excludes intangible amortization was $283 million compared with $290 million in the linked quarter and $280 million in last year\u2019s third quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.95 for the recent quarter compared with $2.01 in the previous quarter and up one penny from the year ago quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity of 1.18% and 12.98% for the recent quarter, the comparable returns were 1.24% and 13.76% in the second quarter of 2015. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning\u2019s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Looking to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $699 million for the third quarter of 2015, representing a 4% increase from last year\u2019s third quarter and up $10 million or an annualized 6% from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.14% during the quarter, down three basis points from 3.17% in the second quarter. Drivers of the change in margin were as follows: Higher levels of trust deposits placed with the Fed diluted the margin by about 2 basis points but had an immaterial impact on the dollar amount of net interest income. Offsetting that were higher levels of prepayment fees and cash interest received on non-accrual loans which boosted the margin by about 2 basis points. And that implies the majority of the 3 basis-point overall margin decline was attributable to core factors such as loan and deposit pricing.","Average loans increased by $179 million or about 1% annualized compared with the second quarter. The quarter\u2019s results were characterized by high levels of prepayment in addition to the usual slowdown in loans to auto dealers to finance their floor plan inventory.","Looking at each of the portfolio categories on n average basis compared to the link quarter, commercial and industrial loans decreased in annualized 1%; excluding floor plan loans, C&I loans actually grew at a 3% annualized base.","Commercial real estate loans increased by about 1% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined $98 million on annualized 5%. We have chosen not to replace runoff in this portfolio in advance of the Hudson City merger as its portfolio is almost entirely comprised of residential mortgages.","Consumer loans grew an annualized 8%, reflecting good growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans. We were pleased to see that the mid-Atlantic was our strongest region for loan growth during the past quarter, averaging about 6% annualized growth while our Metro region which includes New Jersey, averaged 3% growth. Average core consumer deposits which excludes deposits received at M&T\u2019s Cayman Island office and CDs over 250,000, increased an annualized 4% from the second quarter, primarily due to the higher levels of trust deposits I referenced earlier.","Average investment securities increased $246 million or 1.7% compared with the second quarter. We are currently in compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio requirement that comes into effect in early -- at the beginning of 2016.","Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income or fee income totaled $440 million in the third quarter. The comparable figure in the linked quarter was $497 million which included the $45 million gain on the trade processing sale, I mentioned earlier. Mortgage banking revenues were $84 million in the third quarter compared with $103 million in the prior quarter.","Residential mortgage banking revenues declined by $8 million; about half relating to lower gains on sale which came as a result of a 13% decline in mortgage loans originated for sale while the other half came from softer residential servicing revenues.","Commercial mortgage banking revenues were down $10 million from the prior quarter as purchases of multifamily commercial mortgages by the GSEs slowed from the first half of the year as they managed to the annual caps imposed by their regulator.","Service charges on deposit accounts increased to $107 million, up from $105 million in the second quarter. The increase was balanced between consumer and commercial. Trust income was $114 million in the recent quarter compared with $119 million in the previous quarter. The second quarter figure included $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees; the remainder of the decline is largely attributable to lower market values of managed assets due to the recent stock market decline.","We note that after adjusting for the impact of the trade processing sale, both the gain and the divested revenues total non-interest revenue was up 2% through the first three quarters of 2015 compared with the same period last year.","Turning to expenses, expenses continue to be well-controlled. Operating expenses for the third quarter which exclude expenses from the amortization of tangible assets were $650 million, down from $691 million in the linked quarter which of course included the $40 million donation to the M&T Charitable Foundation. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses declined $8 million or 1%. Sharply lower professional service costs were partially offset by higher employee benefit expenses. As a result, the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization was 57.1% for the third quarter, improved from 58.2% in the second quarter and 58.4% in the year ago quarter.","Next, let\u2019s turn to credit. Non-accrual loans were $787 million or 1.15% of total loans at the end of the third quarter, a $10 million or 2 basis-point decline from the end of the second quarter. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $40 million compared with $21 million in the second quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 24 basis points for the period compared with an unusually low 13 basis points in the previous quarter.","Looking back over the past two years, our trend in credit losses has been fairly consistent. Annualized net charge-offs were 19 basis points of total loans for the first three quarters of 2015, unchanged from the first three quarters of 2014. The provision for credit losses was $44 million in the second quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $4 million. That excess provision brought the allowance for credit losses to $934 million at the end of September and reflects our assessment of a loss content in the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance to loans was 1.36%, unchanged from the prior quarter. The loan loss allowance as September 30th was seven times 2015\u2019s annualized year-to-date net charge-offs.","Finally, loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at acquisition were $231 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $194 million or 84% are guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the transitional Basel III capital rule currently in effect, was an estimated 10.08% at the end of the recent quarter, up from 9.91% at the end of June.","Now turning to the outlook, this past quarter was important as it represents our last quarter before the combination of M&T and Hudson City. We thought it would be helpful to revisit where M&T has been on a standalone basis before we offer our thoughts on the impact from Hudson City.","Through the first three quarters, our average loan growth is 4.8%, still running slightly ahead of the 4% projection we gave on the January earnings call, despite a very competitive lending environment.","Our outlook on net interest margin remains unchanged consistent with past comments. The pressure on the core margin from loan and deposit pricing remains in the area of about 3 basis points per quarter. Net interest income is up 2% through the first three quarters of \u201815 compared with the same period last year. While an increase in short-term rates would more than offset those margin pressures, should that occur; we\u2019ve learned not to hold our breath waiting for such an event.","It\u2019s worth noting that the elevated levels of prepayment fees and interest on non-accrual loans in the past quarter could well return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. The softness in the mortgage markets especially non-interest income, as noted earlier, adjusting for the trade processing divestures, non-interest revenues were also up 2% over the first three quarters compared to last year\u2019s -- the same period last year. Taken together, 2% growth in both spread revenues and fee revenues illustrates the slow revenue growth environment in which we\u2019re operating.","Regarding expenses, we are pleased with our progress towards improving our efficiency ratio over the course of this year. We remain focused on optimizing areas of our expense base as a way of funding the additional investments we want to make toward enhancing our technology infrastructure. It remains our goal to demonstrate continued improvement in the efficiency ratio over time.","Credit trends have shown little change. Although the net charge-offs increased this quarter from what was an unsustainably low level in the second quarter, the 19 basis-point charge-off ratio for the year-to-date period has been consistent for some time now and other credit measures are still trending in a positive direction.","In all, the slow revenue growth environment has been challenging for banks, although we\u2019ve tracked relatively well versus our peer group. It\u2019s has been our historical practice in this type of environment to focus on managing expenses to produce modest positive operating leverage, such that the growth in the bottom line is a little bit better than the top line.","So, let\u2019s turn to Hudson City and the impact from the merger. After a long waiting period, we are pleased that based on our estimates, the economics of the transaction are intact. Our current expectation is that the merger will contribute mid-single-digit accretion to net operating earnings in 2016, slightly lower than our previous estimate. This excludes revenue synergies or changes in business mix that should occur over time. At the same time, we estimate higher accretion to tangible book value per share and higher accretion to regulatory capital than our previous estimates. Those higher upfront economic benefits reflect the impact of changes in market conditions on the value of Hudson City\u2019s assets and liabilities. As such a greater portion of the economics of the transaction will be realized upfront in the opening balance sheet in the form of tangible capital. To the extent this capital can be deployed effectively or returned to shareholders, there could be additional positive impact on future earnings per share.","In summary, our key estimates for the transaction are as follows: Mid-single digit accretion in net operating earnings in 2016; immediately accretive to tangible book value per share; immediate accretion to the regulatory capital ratios in the range of 50 to 70 basis points. Our estimated internal rate of return from the transaction is unchanged from our due diligence estimates of approximately 18%.","Underlying those estimates are the following assumptions: We expect to close the transaction on November 1st, but don\u2019t anticipate fully converting Hudson City to M&T systems and back-office until sometime near the end of the first quarter of 2016. We still expect to de-lever the Hudson City balance sheet, but the implementation of the liquidity coverage ratio may require us to retain a modest portion of the securities and borrowings as compared with our original projections.","When that de-leveraging is completed and inclusive of acquisition accounting, we expect Hudson City to add about $19 billion of loans and $24 billion of assets to M&T\u2019s premerger balance sheet.","The retention of securities and borrowings in order to neutralize the impact from Hudson City\u2019s balance sheet on our liquidity coverage ratio position will modestly reduce the net interest margin for the consolidated balance sheet below premerger M&T, but will have little impact on net interest income.","Our estimate of merger-related expenses is substantially unchanged from our original projections. When the deal was announced we estimated that we would be able to rationalize approximately 24% of Hudson City\u2019s premerger expense base, net of additions to staff required to build out a commercial banking capabilities within the Hudson City footprint. Given that we\u2019ve added to our existing presence in New Jersey, we believe we can likely exceed our original estimate.","Of course as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties in various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in the interest rates and credit spread, political events, and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now, let\u2019s open up the call to questions before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Maybe starting out kind of what you\u2019ve touched on last about the progress on hiring the commercial lenders in New Jersey in the Hudson City footprint. Can you remind us how -- whether you are kind of already there and basically how quickly you think you can ramp up the loan growth in the Hudson City footprint?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So, in total, we have on the ground 122 I believe this last count of folks focused on interfacing with customers. And we have -- our loan book has now grown in the interim time here to about 1.5 billion and is pretty much on track with sort of what our expectation was when we sort of set out to do this. And the teams are working very well together. So, it\u2019s not just commercial bankers, we\u2019ve got very strong team of wealth professionals from Wilmington Trust. We have basically mortgage folks; we have the full complement. What will be added to that is our presence in the branches which tends -- obviously is a benefit to commercial but it will be a real benefit to business banking lending. And so my sense is we\u2019ve got a nice pace of growth there from commercial and commercial real estate -- in the commercial real estate space. It will be nice to get a boost from the business banking side as well. So, I don\u2019t anticipate any difficulty in building out an M&T bank in New Jersey.","David Eads","And then how should we think about the trajectory for the mortgages on the balance sheet? You guys obviously ran it down decently this quarter and Hudson City has been running theirs down; it seems like 3% to 4% a quarter. Should we kind of expect those kind of trends to continue or is there anything else we should think about from the mortgage on the balance sheet side?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think the model that Hudson City ran, particularly with the volume and the volume includes use of brokerages is for us will be discontinued, so that will reduce in that balance sheet streaking over time. And I don\u2019t -- I mean it\u2019s sort of a random walk. So, look at current prepayments fees, look at how the portfolio has been paying down over the last six months and that\u2019s where I would focus my attention.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","My first question is just a little bit of more detail on the standalone guidance that you gave, Ren\u00e9. You made a significant amount of -- continued to make significant amount of progress on the expense front for standalone M&T. And I am wondering as we think about the $200 million in other costs of operations, is that a sustainable number going forward or how much more savings do we think can come out of that line?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So, I think at this point in time what we are doing in terms of looking at efficiencies is we\u2019re examining our whole operations and not any one particular line item on the balance sheet. So that could come all the way through the categories from salaries and benefits, all the way through that the other operating expenses that you mentioned.","We maybe a little bit high today in professional services which still amount of -- some measure of work going on in the compliance and responses that we need to complete; little bit around CCAR that we need to complete. But as that goes away, you\u2019ll see that we report into IT. So as an example, our total IT expense I think from second to the third quarter was up $8 million. You see that total expenses are flat. That\u2019s essentially what\u2019s been happening. So other expenses have come down but we\u2019ve redeployed that into investment in IT. That\u2019s the type of thing that I would expect to keep happening. But I think -- I don\u2019t know that I would be solely focused on other operating expenses; I\u2019d be focused on the whole picture.","Erika Najarian","So in that case, is $654 million a good level set of a base that we should think about as we think about standalone M&T from here?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don\u2019t know. In a very-very-very short-term, sure; but in terms of what we\u2019re really trying to do is we\u2019re trying to get a positive spread between revenue growth and expenses. So, it could go higher depending on what our opportunities are. I think it\u2019s worth, we\u2019ve been looking a little bit back at where we\u2019ve been to kind of come up with our thoughts there. And Don and Andy and I looked at every quarter going back three years and we looked at our performance on each category relative to our peer group which is 12 institutions. We basically came out on top in terms of revenue growth over that period. And we came out in terms of PP&R, so revenue minus expense; we came out top quartile. One of the things that\u2019s been noticeably different is we have been continually -- we\u2019ve not taken our down our allowance and you\u2019ve seen that we provided more in our allowance. And that\u2019s a bit of a different trend than we\u2019ve seen in the performance of peers that they sort of have taken their \u2013 right-sized their allowance to some degree.","So when we look at it, we kind of think to ourselves, okay, boy, we wish our overall performance over that period was a little bit better in terms of EPS. But at the end of the day, in terms of the strength of the franchise, we\u2019re doing pretty well on the revenue growth front in a tough environment.","So, our goal would be able to keep -- to try to keep doing that and which would mean that maybe we would grow expenses slightly but as long as we grow them slower, it will keep us on our mission.","Erika Najarian","And just one last one on Hudson City, as you mentioned, the accretion to tangible book value and regulatory capital is going to be greater than expected. And you plan to return or thinking about returning that excess back to shareholders. In your understanding of the CCAR process, is the capital that you are going to accrete from that deal outside of the regular course of M&T business going to be looked at separately by the regulators in CCAR as they think about how much of your earnings that you could payout in 2016?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, I think the way you need to think about it is prior to an acquisition, your job is to on a pro forma basis bring the two organizations together and try to understand if it still fits the risk profile that you\u2019re comfortable in running an institution. And one of the biggest measures of that is that how does it fare under stressful conditions. And so we\u2019ve done that formally two times, maybe three or four. So, our sense today is as we look at that, we look at the combined institution. Having said that, we generate a lot of capital on our own and we\u2019re now sitting with more capital than we had anticipated when we were running those stress tests and were doing that on a portfolio that will continue to run down and be right-sized to the size of the franchise. So said another way, we\u2019re going to generate a lot of excess capital as we move forward. And I think we just have to present that the right way. And like always we may find opportunities to deploy it; if we don\u2019t, we got to figure out ways to make sure we get that back to the shareholders. But I think based on our previous tests and kind of how we feel where we\u2019ve been running recently, we think when we complete the deal, we\u2019ll have quite a bit of excess capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I want to follow up on the comment that including Hudson City there\u2019d be a modest pressure to the NIM but little impact of it on net interest income dollars. I just want to clarify that because obviously you\u2019re adding $24 billion of assets and I would net of NIM pressure, there\u2019s still actual accretion to net and interest income dollars. So, maybe I heard that wrong.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thanks Matt for that question; let me clarify. So, when we originally started out, we had said that we bring the two institutions together. It didn\u2019t really have an effect on our printed net interest margin percentage. And at that time we were de-levering all of the securities. It seems like the most economical thing to do is to keep in the neighborhood of $2 billion of those securities and hang on to some of the borrowings. And that\u2019s almost like what we\u2019ve been doing over the past two years of adding in those securities to corporate ratios. So, if you just look at that slightly higher than $2 billion trade, we think that is kind of -- that is neutral to net interest income. And then -- so therefore instead of being neutral when we bring the two institutions together, we\u2019ll be slightly lower in our net interest margin as a combined entity. That more clear?","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, got it. So including all $24 billion of assets, the NIM will be a little bit lower; obviously you pick up a lot of dollars of the interest income then.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, exactly.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then just coming back to the actual accretion, what\u2019s the tangible book value accretion that you estimate now and is that before after marks?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Everything we said is after marks; it\u2019s the end result; haven\u2019t really said the number -- think about in the range of 3%. Remember that when we first did the transaction, when you use percentages, the bank was a lot smaller and the capital was smaller, so those dollar numbers are actually larger than what 3% or 4% would have produced three years ago.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then just lastly, as we think about the earnings accretion and what that gets us in terms of call it combined earnings power of company, show we just take this quarter\u2019s earnings; annualize it; maybe assume some modest growth of that and then mid-single digit accretion; and that\u2019s good the starting point, obviously without any benefit of higher rates or anything like that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I can\u2019t pick for you the quarter to start with but I think you\u2019re thinking about it the right way and that sort of why we talked about where we\u2019ve been trending as a standalone organization. And if we didn\u2019t have Hudson City, we try to tell you the things that we would be doing. And I mean the operating leverage concept is that you can produce more on the bottom line then you get on you get on your top line but you can\u2019t change the fact that we\u2019re in a low revenue growth environment, all the banks are in that same space.","So, I can\u2019t pick your starting point, but just step back a bit, I think that\u2019s how you should -- that\u2019s how I would go about it; that\u2019s how we\u2019re going about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","So, maybe just following up on the M&T standalone guidance discussion, you talked earlier about just the challenging revenue and in that sort of neighborhood so far you\u2019ve seen about 2% revenue growth I guess from NII and from the fee income lines. I guess what\u2019s -- when you think about your projections for standalone M&T into the next 12 months, what kind of operating leverage are you trying to target? Are you trying target 1% to 2% positive operating leverage or what -- I guess what\u2019s the sort of thought process around if it\u2019s going to be a 2% revenue growth environment, does that you mean you are going be trying to keep expenses flat or how should we think about that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I like the idea that we were able to -- I think we got 1% to 1.5% improvement in efficiency ratio year-over-year and I think that -- let\u2019s think about this way, if you did that every other year, you defiantly have the lowest cost structure in the industry. And that was probably 2% or so. So, if you can get 1% spread over a long period of time, it gives you a tremendous advantage that might be we shoot for that but as long as we get positive operating leverage -- any positive operating leverage is a good thing.","Brian Klock","I think you\u2019re looking at to how challenging it\u2019s been and obviously the expense you guys have put in BSA\/AML is still pretty impressive when I think about the returns you have generated versus your peers. So, I am looking forward to having you guys focus on what you do well and getting those costs down and integrating the deal.","I guess on a follow-up side of this on the Hudson City impact, you mentioned mid-single-digit accretion of \u201816, but it sounds like from the timing of layering in the integration and obviously in some of the LCR stuff that seems to be early in the year, do you think that by the time we get to the back half of \u201816 that we might be maybe upper single digits to accretion as your run rate into \u201817 or how should we think about that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think there are two things to think about. I think the first one you\u2019ve got which is that we can\u2019t get expense savings until we get through the integration. So, you\u2019ve got that which I wouldn\u2019t expect to see -- really benefits of that really until the second quarter.","And then on the other side of it, this is the real banking work; we\u2019ve got to change the mix. So, balance sheet there was ballooned with more mortgages than we would have practically carried which means that you\u2019re relatively aggressive in your deposit pricing. And you\u2019re only using time. But for us as over time we convert that to sort of the full-service commercial type bank, we should be able to get some synergies from bringing on more non-interest bearing deposits and those more sort of core business and consumer deposits. That will take some time but that\u2019s what our job is.","Brian Klock","And then last question, it has been pretty challenging from a commercial growth perspective for the industry this quarter; it\u2019s been seasonally soft. Obviously you\u2019ve pointed out the dealer floor plan which is seasonally soft. Obviously the fourth quarter for dealer floor plan comes back, I guess what you think about your core sort of middle-market C&I customer and maybe can talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the pipeline and for the fourth quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It\u2019s interesting. We gather all the commentary from every single region every quarter we sit down and we chat. And the as I look at it this quarter, it\u2019s been the quietest ever since. And what I mean by that is it\u2019s not like the competition is abated but when you look spreads particularly in what we call middle-market which is mostly C&I, most of the regions had decent originations and from a roll-on margin perspective, it was not different from the previous quarter; so there wasn\u2019t continued pressure there or increasing pressure. My sense is that our sales force has done a very, very nice job. And it doesn\u2019t change the competitive environment. But I can\u2019t imagine that we would see it slowing in any way, shape or form. I mentioned it in the comments that we\u2019re really pleased to see the mid-Atlantic kind of have another quarter growth which seems like those guys on the ground there have really sort of turned it around from where we were a couple of years ago.","So things look pretty good. The one trend that we saw that we\u2019ve been sort of internally talking about which is the long-term trend is we saw a number of payoffs in Western New York and the largest of those were companies being taken out by private equity firms and financed outside of our bank. So that\u2019s a trend that you step way back in non-bank lending private equity in those spaces had an impact on the industry. And I think that might continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey","Thinking about loan growth, I know you talked about sort of continued attrition on the resi book. If I look at M&T standalone, you\u2019ve grown loans about $3 billion over the last year. Hudson City has seen just north of that in loan attrition. Is it fair to think that, on a combined basis, you guys are more or less flat over the next 12 months?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don\u2019t know -- I mean I don\u2019t think you\u2019re thinking about it wrong, but I just think look at the prepayments fees there. I think you\u2019re right; our outlook for the loan growth is not any different than we\u2019ve been running. And we\u2019ve been running at about 5% loan growth annually. Don and I talked about it before but we\u2019ve been slightly ahead of that. And I think what\u2019s important is we\u2019ve been doing that with very limited margin compression. So, not just the loan growth, it\u2019s can you do it with rationale rates. So,. I would guess we are able to stay there.","Bob Ramsey","Shifting gears back to kind of the capital question, you guys really emphasize you\u2019re going to generate a lot of capital going forward and you are starting off in a stronger place in terms of equity accretion than when the deal was announced. How are you thinking now about the potential to use the share repurchase authorization in your 2015 CCAR test now that you\u2019ve got the approval and Hudson City will close pretty quickly here?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Process-wise, what it makes us think about Bob is, it\u2019s obviously worth it to continue to invest and focus on our CCAR process because while we\u2019re all used to historically just looking at it from a quantitative perspective, the gate-keeping is all around the qualitative. So, we\u2019ll continue to put heavy emphasis in that area, making sure that we continue to make good progress there and keep up with what the best standards are in the industry. And then I think we\u2019re well below the payout ratios even with what we submitted and got approved last time. We\u2019re sort of at the low-end ratio with total payout of our peers. So my sense is that has to get normalized. But even after that, I think given the circumstances that we\u2019ve just talked about, if didn\u2019t think about some other opportunities, capital would continue to grow. So, we\u2019ve got to think about that strategically. But I would expect that we\u2019ll try to normalize our payout ratios with the rest of the industry.","Bob Ramsey","I guess what I\u2019m saying is given that position, it sounds like you all are inclined to use the $200 million of authorization you\u2019ve got this year?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","The way you asked that question, we don\u2019t have any different -- we don\u2019t have any different thoughts than when we submitted our plan.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. I guess -- and maybe I don\u2019t remember right, I thought originally when you all had submitted the plan the thought was you want to get Hudson City done first but you did want to have this out there and sort of see how the year progressed and would sort of assess\u2026","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I see what you\u2019re asking; yes, that\u2019s absolutely true; that\u2019s exactly the same. Getting the integration behind us is sort of a watershed event for us. So, we\u2019ll get that behind us and then think about how we move forward there. But it\u2019s not different from what I was saying earlier.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Any thoughts on other bank M&A, now that this deal has finally got an approval?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","The only thought I have is number one, we\u2019re going to focus on the integration of this deal. We think we\u2019ve got it well under control and that it\u2019s not likely -- it\u2019s likely to go pretty smoothly. And then on that basis, I guess the thing I would just sort of reiterate is that despite how much capital you have sitting around we don\u2019t do transactions unless they make a lot of economic sense. And so doing them for the sake of doing them doesn\u2019t have much appetite for us. So, we\u2019ll just have to see what comes up. But our first priority is to sort of finish our risk work and integrate this transaction and a lot of work on the ground in New Jersey. So we\u2019re happy about that. I guess I would say from what I know today, we\u2019re relatively content with the work we have in front of us.","Bob Ramsey","Last question and I\u2019ll hop out. But just on the FDIC assessment line, can you remind us what the expectation is for the FDIC insurance expense with Hudson City in there both I guess in the fourth quarter and then I think that that rate sort of gets reevaluated; I just can\u2019t remember exactly how it works.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I\u2019ve got a lot of blank stares around the table.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. We can circle back up on that offline I guess.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Can you talk about how far Hudson City is currently from where you think you\u2019ll need to get it, so that you have the kind of branch density that you\u2019ve historically had in your core markets where I guess convenience has been one of the factors that has enabled you to enjoy below market funding costs?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It\u2019s a great question. I mean let me start off by saying if you\u2019ve got a publish an investor presentation somewhere in the next 30 days, but when you look at the branch presence that we get with 130 branches which are not all in New Jersey, some complement -- there\u2019s some complement -- we\u2019re in Connecticut for the first time. We have very-very nice complement on Long Island. So, when you look at what happens on Long Island from the Hudson City branches combined with the M&T branches, I think you get a meaningful change there. And I\u2019m starting on a smaller end. And then if you actually think about Philadelphia, we were in Philadelphia; then we did Wilmington which gotten more of a presence and we get a few branches in Philadelphia again which helps the density over time. If I go back 15 years ago, everybody would ask what are you doing in Philadelphia. Over time that changes and that density matters a lot.","New Jersey, I think we\u2019re in a good starting position, I forget it was fourth or fifth deposit share, we like to be in the top two or three. And we think that if you\u2019re in the top two or three, you get meaningful -- make a meaningful difference. So my sense is we have work to do there over time but just think about it today I think we have in the neighborhood of -- I\u2019m going to get this wrong, 700 branches to 800 branches -- 700, somewhere in that neighborhood. So, adding a 130 is significant. And so I think it gets us off to a pretty good start. It\u2019ll take some time but we\u2019ll start -- it\u2019ll make a difference especially relative to last year.","Bill Carcache","Switching over to some of the accretion impacts that you ran through earlier, if we set that aside, those immediate impacts and just kind of look forward a little bit longer term, can you talk about what are you most excited about and where you see the greatest opportunity from a P&L perspective?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, I don\u2019t know if I can do it from a P&L perspective but what I\u2019m most excited about is the significance -- significantly outsized level of opportunity for small businesses, middle-market companies in New Jersey in terms of density versus our existing footprint. And we\u2019re not coming in sort of thinking about we\u2019ve just bought some branches and we\u2019re going to work out, we\u2019re coming in with a full-service bank. So, we have the ability to meet the needs of those. And we think we\u2019re differentiated in our approach relative to the existing institutions that serve those markets today.","So it\u2019s not one line item. I think that the way in which we\u2019re going to be able to come in with our product set which is now much broader than it was 15 years ago, my sense is that I\u2019m really, really looking forward to becoming a really a well-known productive member of those communities. The other thing I\u2019m excited about is we add a lot of employees on the ground in New Jersey. And adding significant amounts of people is really what makes us notable in a community. It\u2019s not just the guys that are out there making loans, it\u2019s that we begin to have the ability to have people in all kinds of the sort of organizations that improve the quality of life in New Jersey and we try to become part of the fabric. So it\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s going to be across the board but that\u2019s what I\u2019m most excited about, it should be a lot of fun.","Bill Carcache","And switching gears to the fee income line, I wanted to follow up on some of the comments that you made about the softness that was on mortgage banking revenues this quarter. Can you frame for us what kind of run rate for standalone M&T we should be thinking about going forward in -- broadly in the fee income line?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes. So, I gave you the impacts of the decline, little less than half in retail; half in commercial. On the retail side, we\u2019ve been moving along -- part of that decline was in our mortgage servicing book; and then short-term you could see that stay at those levels. But we do have, as I mentioned, the appetite and the capacity at some point, should the opportunity arise to do more in that space. So, when you think longer term, my sense is as long as we remain a strong servicer through with strong policies and performance that we have today that could be a bigger space for us and provide some upside to where we\u2019re running.","If you go to the commercial side, a lot of the decline was really caused by the cap. So, the business is running along, I would suspect that in that business across the industry you saw probably the similar decline. In our case, maybe it was a little bit more and I think we\u2019re at the lower levels that we\u2019ve seen in the long time. So even despite the cap, my sense is that we could still a little bit of a rebound there as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Sameer Gokhale","I just want to go back your commentary about the 24% in cost saves that you are anticipating. I just wanted to clarify because I think going back to your comments a while back when the deal was announced it looks like a lot of those costs were associated with technology related and similar type costs. So, should I expect that you realize those in Q4, and then Q1 2016 onwards you have that cost reduction all baked in; is that the way to think about it? Because I think those were related to data processing and service agreements and the like. So I just want to clarify that.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","The sort of base elements of what you\u2019re saying are correct, but remember, unlike what we have done in our history, we couldn\u2019t this time do a simultaneous merger conversion. So, we need all that technology. The bank will run on its existing technology through conversion which doesn\u2019t take place until the first quarter. So post that, when we\u2019re not using those services, those services, post the first quarter will be performed by M&T.","Sameer Gokhale","And then just thinking about the timeframe, obviously it\u2019s been two years now and you\u2019ve finally got the approval to close on the deal. But relative to your initial expectations, I would\u2019ve thought between then and now that there might have been additional areas where you could have maybe realized or thought about more operating efficiencies and the like, so that when you close the deal, you\u2019d probably get more of the benefit in that regard than you might have initially expected. So, was it just a function of the deal kind of dragging on and the fact that maybe Hudson City couldn\u2019t make the changes it needed to in anticipation of the deal that might result in less cost savings or the same cost savings relative to what you\u2019d have estimated? I was just wondering why there couldn\u2019t be more in savings just given the fact that you\u2019ve had more time to work through operational issues and the like.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So, it\u2019s really, really -- it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s really, really important to understand that in today\u2019s environment until you have approval, you really can\u2019t go anywhere near that other institution, you run totally separately and you don\u2019t have any influence over the management whatsoever. And that\u2019s not a gray area at all. So, we have not been engaged in any of that type of activity.","I think the other thing is that really where a lot of the -- all of our areas are fantastic, but there are very few places where you get the full force of an M&T like banking experience where you don\u2019t have a lot of branches. So, the idea that we now are bringing on the branches, all those branch employees, I think that actually will give us a lot more opportunities in time to be thinking about that. And they\u2019re not -- don\u2019t think about it all as in this particular case, as expense reduction; think of it as opportunities to sort of apply broader services to that same set of customers who today are using really basic time accountings. They all have banking account relationships. They\u2019re not just doing their full-service banking with Hudson.","Sameer Gokhale","And then just a question again just going back to the yields on your C&I loans and I think you referenced also growth in indirect auto. And indirect auto in particular has been an area where people have talked a lot in the prime side about margin compression, yield compression; and on the C&I side, of course you saw some yield compression. And I would say that that has been a little bit mixed. And I think you\u2019ve been seeing yields coming down, but were you surprised by the magnitude of your decline in the yield sequentially because there seem to be some banks talking about now finally some stabilization in yields on the commercial side. So, if you can just talk about your C&I yield ex where you ended up relative to expectations, and then on the indirect auto, why pursue growth here when that\u2019s one of the most competitive areas out there? So, just to get your thoughts would be helpful.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It didn\u2019t feel to me like we had significant compression. Obviously when we look at C&I yields, we look -- we net out the prepayment fees and things like that, the first fees. And as I look at not the balance sheet, but we\u2019ve spent a lot of time, I\u2019ve got a deck of looking at all the new loans that are coming onto the system. As I said earlier, they came on at spreads that were pretty consistent with the last two quarters. So, I didn\u2019t see a big change there. I would agree, I would agree that -- let me say it this way, it won\u2019t take much of a rate increase at all for all that margin compression to go away. And I kind of feel like even with where there is speculation about rates increasing, the actual market rates increase, and I think it benefits us. So, my sense is that a lot of what we had seen a year or more ago has slowed down. But I think the pricing on loans I don\u2019t expect the margins to be able to go up. But I think the overall movement in the balance sheet stays sort of where it is now, unless we get a little increase in rates.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I just want to congratulate you again on getting the approval for Hudson City after a long time, finally good to see that. So, thanks for your comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Just a couple of follow-ups, first on credit losses. I realized your point that year-to-date losses are pretty -- in terms of the ratio are basically right on top of where they were last year. But just looking at this quarter versus the last quarter, was there any clean up in the portfolio that you were looking at ahead of the Hudson City transaction or is that -- was that basically a one-off or two-off this quarter that you don\u2019t expect to continue, given what appears to be guidance for pretty stable credit performance going forward on a M&T standalone basis?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, there is no such thing as cleanup at M&T. As we see things, we record them. But I what I would say is that just think about it this way. If you take the second and third quarter and merge them together, I think you come out with a charge-off rate of 18.5 basis points. So, the message has been incredibly stable in terms of any way you look at it, we seem to be running about 19 basis points. So my sense is unless we see some change in the economy or that over a long periods of -- over a while, will be there. Now having said that I think our lowest charge-off rate in my time is 16 basis points. So, it doesn\u2019t get much lower than this and our average is 37. So, these are the points in time when you typically would see that we\u2019re at a place where each quarter we\u2019ve added a little bit to the allowance because you\u2019re kind of as good as it gets. And you got to start making sure that is as things are frothy out there particularly with the other bank, with other lenders and particularly with non-bank lenders, the competitiveness tends to cyclically turn around and produce issues on credit. And so we\u2019re sort of looking forward there and you\u2019ve seen us add a little bit to our allowance over time. That would be pretty typical because we\u2019re sort of at lows in charge-off experience and eventually that has to turn around.","Don MacLeod","The other thing I\u2019d mention maybe it\u2019s -- Matt, you\u2019re seeing a sort of statistically stable level of charge-offs coming out of the consumer portfolios but commercial charge-offs come when they come. And there was a very low level of commercial charge-offs in 2Q and just a couple of loans that the charged off in 3Q.","Matt Burnell","Understood, that\u2019s helpful. And then Ren\u00e9, you mentioned your focus is in -- is really turning to tech investments with sort of the incremental investment dollar that you\u2019re creating with some savings elsewhere. Can you give us a little more color as to what areas those tech investment are going to focus on? I think you\u2019ve mentioned CCAR as being an area where you still want to make sure that your processes are continuing to improve, but are there other investments maybe in the retail product side or other areas that you are also targeting?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes. So, there are four to five general themes that make up our technology plan. Just sort of generally speaking, one theme is integrated risk and regulatory compliance reporting of platforms, making sure all of our regulatory activities are sitting on the same platform; rethinking of our integrated sales and service capabilities not by line of business but across the board. We\u2019re looking at a lot around origination, account opening on onboarding frameworks for the institution. We\u2019re looking at a whole another category which is employee experience, reducing the work and time -- administrative time that our employees have to spend. And then finally, another line of category is sort of things that allow us to have a 360 degree view of the customer.","So, to give you some more specifics, I mean couple of things that we\u2019ve been -- in the works for a little while now is one of the things we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re developing a framework for centralized management and linking of customer data to create an enterprise customer hub. So, we\u2019ve never really had a full-service enterprise customer hub. It will take a long time to get there but we\u2019ve been spending money moving in that direction and think of a platform that all of each individual business could use regardless of where the customer comes in.","On the regulatory front and more, we\u2019re doing a lot around enterprise data management. We\u2019ve got a large data quality initiative going on. And really what we\u2019re trying to do there is to position the bank\u2019s data sources for scalability and usability. And initially we think that helps us you know strengthen our reporting and our regulatory front but ultimately we think that helps us have higher integrity around our customer data. And we think as we move forward, that will be a big-big benefit.","Many of these things are -- you mentioned the customer side, we\u2019re doing a lot around the expansion of our online banking platform to include things like mobile banking alerts, analytics and the like, and also technology that could be used in the branch network as well to supplement the branch network like remote check deposits and so forth.","So the way I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve got a very large framework, it\u2019s not in one area but we just think that given where we are, these types of efforts are going to be key for us to be much more efficient over time. The banking industry as a whole has not been at the forefront of technology investment but we think in the future, you really need to sort of -- that will be one of the biggest competitive advantages.","Matt Burnell","Sounds like no opportunity to sit still. The final question I have is you mentioned you\u2019re growing presence in Long Island in Connecticut partly helped by the HCBK transaction. And also your ideal market share is usually top two or three in most markets. It doesn\u2019t appear that you\u2019re very close to that in either Connecticut or Long Island. Is that an area over time that you would like to grow into a number two or number three or is that -- does that target really not apply to those markets?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, I think that economics of banking, they don\u2019t change. It matters that you\u2019ve got a very strong market position to be an outperformer there. But having said that, I think if you\u2019d asked Bob Wilmers when is the first time you thought about the idea that you could have a bank in New Jersey, it would have been a long, long time ago and not -- but the opportunities -- the right opportunities with the right people don\u2019t just come around every day. So, you really can\u2019t predict that. So, those are all markets that we like a lot that are very attractive. And at some point in time, it\u2019s the right opportunity were to present itself, so we go there. But it\u2019s not a predictable thing. I think we wanted to be in New Jersey for decades.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Ren\u00e9, you mentioned that the tangible book value accretion, call it 3% or so, if I heard right, I just wanted to square that up with the $2 billion of borrowings that you guys plan on keeping. Normally, I would assume that if you refinance the $2 billion from Hudson that would\u2019ve incurred a fairly large charge, given the long duration nature of the liabilities. How much is not refinancing those securities adds to tangible book value if that makes sense?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. So, the way you think about it is the step one, you mark everything to market, so that gets -- that charge that you\u2019re talking about we will take it is the same charge. But now when you\u2019re sitting on your balance sheet, you have those same liabilities or should be exactly what you could go out and fund in the market, so they\u2019re substitutable. So, we will take the charges; that won\u2019t change. So almost, you could almost think about it as getting new funding. Market prices shouldn\u2019t be any different.","The one thing I would tell you Ken is that relative to when we started, Hudson City had a lot of MBS and those types of things. That\u2019s kind of been mostly replaced with cash and treasuries. So, a lot of the execution risk that you had way back then is now gone and should be pretty executable.","Ken Zerbe","And then in terms of the timing of selling the -- the security, say you will be selling; is that something you can actually get done by year-end or are you going to be holding some of those in the first quarter.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We think we can probably get the majority of it done by year-end. We will be doing most of it as you said in the first quarter and we will watch to make sure that we don\u2019t have any disruption in the markets there. But I think that\u2019s our expectation that we\u2019ll have the majority if it done by year-end.","Ken Zerbe","So, first quarter should have more of a normalized NIM? Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I Think so.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, one clarification also on the accretion. So, you mentioned that mid-single-digit to operating earnings, I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s also some amortization that will come with the Hudson City deal that\u2019s not included in that number. And since it\u2019s been such a long time since we\u2019ve gotten that update, I know we got that February 8-K that talked about it being I think about $19 million for year one; does that still ring true now that you\u2019ve kind of gotten to the end point here?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, I mean -- I\u2019m not sure I fully understand your question but I think\u2026","Ken Usdin","I\u2019m basically just saying your comments about operating EPS accretion; the way you usually do operating is ex-amortization. And I\u2019m assuming that with the Hudson City acquisition, you will have some intangible amortization. I\u2019m just wondering if you can quantify that for us.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, I can\u2019t quantify. So, I\u2019ll take a look at that and see if I can get that in our deck in November. But I think it\u2019d probably be better to mention that after we finally finalize all the marks which will be in November 1st NIM.","Ken Usdin","And then this then might run to that also because I was just wondering then originally the cost saves were going to be you\u2019d said originally three years ago, $55 million of absolute saves. And just wondering again, can you just refresh us please? That number was ex the FDIC expense declines that were expected and then just relative to that $55 million are you bigger, smaller, different? Because you talked about in percentage terms and I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about it in dollar terms.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to talk about it that way. I guess the way I think about it is we separated that out. I would think that you are going to see Hudson City\u2019s FDIC expense normalized to ours and those rates should be about the same. And so that\u2019s how I would do that. And then what we kept separate is we talked about being about 24% of the expense base but that was net of the adds that we had. So, I think we can do -- I think our number will be slightly better than that because it is already higher than most of the folks that we need.","Ken Usdin","And then just two things on the quarter, first of all, anything notable and just the other fees, other income in fees was decently above trend; were there any one timers in there this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think that the way I think about it is, we were up a little bit in gains from our commercial leasing business but we were also down in participations and down in syndications. So from one category to the next, different -- one time in the sense of the type of transaction but they\u2019re all coming from our commercial base and my sense is that that\u2019s a little lumpy from time to time.","Ken Usdin","And then last one just on the trust part of business, you mentioned that sequential was mostly impacted by market levels and in the absence from the second quarter tax; that business ex the trade processing business sale, still having a tough time growing. And I\u2019m just wondering anything strategic new or different to think about as far as you\u2019re trying to level set on that business or is it really just a question of the market levels that are going drive growth from here?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. I think we -- first of all, I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work there. I think our plans are to continue to do a tremendous amount of work. And it\u2019s never going to be a high revenue growth business; it\u2019s going to be more of a steady progression because you\u2019re building these trusted relationships with individuals. So, it\u2019s not something that happens over night; it\u2019s capabilities that you continue to build. And I think if you look at what\u2019s happened over time and you factor in the fact that we had the market being down, we were not immune to that. To give you an example, I think that in the periods -- between the pricing periods from the second quarter to where we price in the third quarter, the S&P was down more than 8%, our customer portfolios saw a 3% decline in their market values.","So, as long as we continue to perform like that, we\u2019ll build long-term relationships but you can\u2019t get immune from the fact that the market goes down from time to time and that\u2019s how you get paid into your fees. So we feel very good.","Ken Usdin","I was just going to ask then like core growth ex the markets. Can you give us a sense of how that\u2019s been building? Is there -- relationship adds or core asset adds if you isolate the impact from markets?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I mean we measure new sales volume and lost business and our retention rates are very, very, very high, 98%, 99%. And every year since we\u2019ve had Wilmington Trust, our new sales have far outstripped any lost business. So, we continue to grow there. And we\u2019ve divested a couple of lines of business. I think we\u2019re really close to being done with those things that we don\u2019t think are core. But the core business is doing very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","I have three questions I wanted to ask you which are a little bit different. One is the deposit costs at Hudson City are relatively high, 75 basis points as of last quarter related to your deposit costs of 13 basis points. I was just curious how you kind of plan going forward; you could either kind of let the interest rates go higher and keep their rates the same and therefore neutralize that way, or you assuming rates are going to stay lower, so you have to kind of migrate their rates lower to be more equivalent to your current market offering?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Marty, the way I think about it is, we\u2019ve got this wonderful opportunity in front of us. We have all of these customers who have come to Hudson City for what it offered and we have an opportunity to go introduce ourselves to them. And we are going to spend some time introducing ourselves to them and our other capabilities before we start dealing with rates. That is always been the opportunity whether we were up in Syracuse in OnBank which was a thrift. You\u2019ve got to really use those capabilities, so you can\u2019t think too much financial early in the game.","Marty Mosby","And so over time, maybe not the first year in your accretion estimates but over time, you would have some ability to migrate to get a benefit from that but not immediately.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, exactly, exactly.","Marty Mosby","The other question was when you looked at Hudson City\u2019s loan portfolio being a very legacy mortgage portfolio, it was really a defensive mechanism three years ago when you were thinking about rates not going up very rapidly. We are actually still in kind of the same quagmire that we were three years ago. Do you still look at it as that real defensive for the lower for longer scenario that we seem to be caught in right now?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think I understand what you\u2019re saying. I mean it still has the same impact on our asset liability position. We\u2019re really heavily asset sensitive; I think we go up 5 plus for 100 basis-point increase; we bring the two balance sheets together that takes two points off of that, down to about three. So, it\u2019s sort of we need long fixed assets and it marries up pretty well with our current position.","Marty Mosby","And then lastly, you talked about as you built out your customer data warehouse for the AML\/BSA, that you would also be able to leverage that for your cross-sell within your own organization. And also I was thinking even more when you went down into New Jersey you\u2019d would have that tool behind you; I just didn\u2019t know how you were thinking about leveraging that as you go and turn to the next page.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think that\u2019s right. I think it\u2019s a long-term effort. Because I think you\u2019ve got a focus on the most foundational things. So, it includes customer data, the customer data for regulatory reporting purposes and credit purposes. And once you get through those stages of coming up with the language and governance around those things, that\u2019s what will make the data more flexible and usable for the customers. So, I think that might be a second stage impact.","I think what\u2019s probably -- what a more immediate term is the idea that regardless of where -- let\u2019s say a commercial customer were to come into the institution, if our current commercial RMs were to know about that, if they were able to get access to their private banking capabilities in addition to their business stuff, if they were able to get access to the retail accounts or access to their relationship with what relationship that customer has with Wilmington Trust, that actually to me as much more immediate benefits around the cost shelves. To feel integrated, think about integrated statement. So to me, that\u2019s a more -- that\u2019s a near-term benefit than is the data and the information for us.","Marty Mosby","And any anecdotal kind of messaging? I know you haven\u2019t been able to work with Hudson City\u2019s management, but like you\u2019re saying, any feelings from their part how their customers now waiting three years to have access to MTB\u2019s products; how positive are the feelings or the process as you move in there now?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I knew there would be a lot of excitement on the ground when we were able to announce the approval. I was blown away by the expressions of interest first from our employees and their -- and the Hudson City employees. And I\u2019ve had a number of folks come up to me and say well, I finally now will have an M&T account because they were customers of Hudson City. So, I think the energy is very high. I think we got to carry that to the field. And my guess is, we\u2019ll get off to a good start.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst","Ren\u00e9, once you discontinue the broker mortgage business in New Jersey and across -- and that\u2019s part of the New Jersey for them, what\u2019s left in New Jersey from a mortgage origination capability and is there an opportunity to more quickly replace some of that with your type of business and have some fee income?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We\u2019ll talk about that as -- we have on the -- and I forget the number but we have a fair number of mortgage folks on the ground already that have been doing that work, so we haven\u2019t had started there. And then when you add those 130 branches, we tend to be a big originator of mortgages are the branches, I think you\u2019ll begin to be able to introduce all of the services -- products and services that we typically do. And looking here, we have -- in all of the footprint that represents Hudson City, we already have 29 mortgage bankers on the ground. So, we will continue to build that out. We\u2019ll be able to do maybe a little bit more as we complement that with our services to the branches.","And the way to think about it is, we\u2019re much more in the government space, we\u2019re in the -- think about us being much more heavily in the affordable mortgage space. So in essence, I think we\u2019ll be doing a lot more on that front, we will be a little -- will be very close to the community. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been very, very well known for. So it will look different, the customers that we\u2019re providing mortgages to will be I think of much broader array of customers. ","David Darst","And then just as far as the conversion occurs and late in the first quarter, is it really going to be in the second quarter when you actually have the opportunity to improve the product set or can you do that prior to the conversion?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, on the ground, you\u2019re doing that already because we can do that through our M&T employees. So, on a commercial bank, we\u2019re doing all those services, cash management, we\u2019ve got a whole team of wealth managers there. As I said, we\u2019ve got 29 mortgage bankers on the ground. I just think those capabilities get enhanced. So, think about it this way. We can do everything today but those branches -- we can\u2019t do it through branches because they\u2019re not equipped and staffed and trained with the ability to do that. So, it\u2019ll be a boost is the way to think about it.","David Darst","Correct, beginning in the second quarter of \u201816 you\u2019ll train everyone and launch it then. Okay, got it.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes. And then we have this which I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re doing this time which is fun time thing which we call the branch buddy system. So, we send down whole bunches of M&T bankers who are very familiar with the integration and acquisitions and they spend a lot of time with the existing branch folks that are there. So, it\u2019s sort of hands-on training and hands-on introduction to the customers. It\u2019s worked really well. And we think that sort of speeds up the ability to offer our products and services without a lot of disruption.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","A couple of questions for you, Ren\u00e9. First, you made a comment in talking about Hudson City that you\u2019re planning not to use the broker channel for mortgage originations as they do. Can you give us some color behind the strategic thinking of why you guys don\u2019t use that channel?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, I mean I think for us, it\u2019s a little -- it\u2019s going to sound funny, but it\u2019s a little bit more of a commodity type space where you\u2019re not necessarily controlling the customer experience. So, it\u2019s not like we could have done -- we could have added brokerage in New Jersey all along. I think the way in which we approach our mortgage banking unit is the idea that more branch originated type, M&T originated type business. We still have a better risk profile, we can control the upfront -- who the customer is in the upfront underwriting and so forth. There are some cases where on the risk side where we dabbled very lightly in the past on home equities and things like that with brokerage business and the risk profile wasn\u2019t the same for us. Now having said that Hudson City has done just a tremendous job in that space but we\u2019re just not sure it fits our model. Will we do jumbo mortgages? Yes. We didn\u2019t do very many of them in the past. I think here we\u2019ll continue to do those but we would prefer not to do them necessarily through brokers. And quite frankly if you changed your mind, you could do that at anytime, it\u2019s so commodity like.","Gerard Cassidy","Second is with the recent news of your neighborhood competitor hiring an investment bank to maybe look at different alternatives. Is there been any change in the business environment for you in Western New York?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. I mean we haven\u2019t spent much time on that. We\u2019re -- all of us are spending time on what\u2019s going on in the Buffalo and Western New York community. And Gerard, it\u2019s a funny time. I mean economically -- if you look at economic measures, Buffalo is probably one of our fastest-growing footprints with all that\u2019s going on there. There\u2019s a lot to keep us all busy, a lot of new jobs being created here. And so, we are not really focused on those rumors and things like that. I don\u2019t think it benefits us to do so.","Gerard Cassidy","And then as a follow-up, I think you may have touched on this in the Q&A. In the original slide deck for doing this deal with Hudson City, you identified pretax $223 million in merger-related charges. Is that still a good number to use today?","Don MacLeod","That was -- that number included some things will go through acquisition accounting, Gerard.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Not a change.","Don MacLeod","Right. So, the amount that\u2019ll go through income statement is roughly unchanged.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, that\u2019s both. That\u2019s part of things that would get market and things that would be one-time expenses but I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see any material change when we look at the numbers. Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","And then another question on this time period that you\u2019ve had to wait. Mobile banking has grown very rapidly over this last three-year time period and the adoption of it is moving up quickly as you know from your own numbers. Can you share with us -- has that changed any of your thinkings on how you\u2019re going to implement Hudson City into M&T and are there any potential benefits that now will be here that weren\u2019t here three years ago because mobile banking wasn\u2019t as successful?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s a -- those and capabilities like those have become very fundamental. And so, I don\u2019t think of New Jersey as being different than Buffalo in that respect. I think you just have to have those capabilities; your clients expect them. But one thing is I think is maybe more relevant to the case of adding those technologies is probably the whole issue around cyber security and security trends. I mean you really, really have to be buttoned down as all these new technologies come out; I mean the bad guys keep up with things. And so why do I mention that? New Jersey has a bit of a higher natural incidence of fraud and those types of things. So, we watch that very closely relative to other footprints and make sure that the products that we offered are adapted for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr of CLSA.","Chris Spahr","I kind of have derivative questions off of Marty. The deposit trends or interest bearing deposits have been trending lower the last four quarters. Is there any strategic reason behind that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, it\u2019s matching the decline in sort of the natural rightsizing of the mortgage book, so that will continue right. And that sort of as you get that to more sustainable size, think about no more originations and things like that, that\u2019s also a factor that will play into the deposit pricing.","Chris Spahr","And with the pending, or the soon to close Hudson City deal, should we expect a pickup in interest bearing deposits, just given what Hudson City has been doing in the past?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Pickup in the interest bearing deposits? I mean their balance sheet will come over. Their trends probably from what you\u2019re seeing on them standalone trend wise will probably stay the same. And then we\u2019ll introduce our product. Now, in different rate environments, typically in a rising rate environment, we\u2019re much more dependent upon -- and our customers who are seeking yields are much more dependent on time accounts. So will rates go up and the rate environment would change, yes. I mean you might turn that specific engine that right back on. And that might actually give us from a substitute to wholesale a nice benefit because those markets are more vibrant, so you can quickly raise dollars in a market like that versus some of our other markets. We\u2019ve long done in New York City.","Chris Spahr","And then one final question, regulatory capital, the comments for the benefit of the deal, those are both in regards to CET1 and total capital, or are they different?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It was regulatory, we said CET1.","Operator","At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. MacLeod for any additional or closing remarks.","Don MacLeod","Again, thank you all for participating today. And as always, if clarification of any of the items on the call or news release if necessary, please contact our Investor Relations department at area code (716) 842-5138. Good bye.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s M&T Bank\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings call. You may now disconnect."],"14390":["M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Darren King - EVP and CFO","Don MacLeod - VP and Director of IR","Analysts","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Frank Schiraldi - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Operator","Welcome to the M&T Bank Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Maria and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the investor relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages but participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found in forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the third quarter reflect the initiatives we have underway to position the Bank for future success. The merger with Hudson City Bancorp was completed almost a year ago and the ongoing process of converting a thrift to a commercial bank continues. During the quarter we continued to build out the New Jersey consumer bank, both by growing new households as well as taking steps to reprice the acquired deposit base. For the New Jersey commercial bank, loan balances for the year to date have grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, led by loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises. ","We're pleased to see that our community-focused approach to banking is starting to take root in the New Jersey marketplace. Customer migration arising from the multiple mergers and acquisitions that have occurred within our footprint also continues. We have been advertising and offering incentives to bring in new customers impacted by some of those changes in our markets. Customer growth in the third quarter was the highest we've seen in the past 8 quarters. We've also continued our program of investments in operational infrastructure and technology. As we previously signaled, the enhanced mtb.com website went live during the quarter. Other highlights for the quarter include an upgrade to our ATM network to handle EMV chip-equipped cards and adding a feature to our payment services capability that enables our customers to send and receive same-day ACH transactions.","The upgrade to our consumer mobile app is in final testing and we expect it to go live later this quarter. And finally, we took some actions to get ahead of the pending implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule contained within the Dodd-Frank Act by divesting some securities disallowed by the rule. I'll share some more details on each of these actions and how they impacted us in a few minutes. However, before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Richard King, a member of M&T's Board of Directors. Mr. King joined M&T's Board in 2000, following our acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Keystone Financial. We valued his extensive experience in business and his deep ties to the communities in Pennsylvania. We'll miss his counsel and his friendship. ","Now let's turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.10 for the third quarter of 2016, improved from $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.93 in last year's third quarter. Net income for the quarter was $350 million, up 4% from $336 million in the linked quarter and up 25% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $7 million and $0.04 per common share in the second quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the third quarter results. However, results for the second quarter included merger-related expenses amounting to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share.","Consistent with our long term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. M&T's net operating income for the third quarter which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $356 million compared with $351 million in the linked quarter and $283 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.13 in the recent quarter, improved from $2.07 in this year's second quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.","On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.12% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.68%. This compares to 1.09% and 8.38%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.18% and 12.77% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.68% in the second quarter of 2016. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Included in both GAAP and net operating results were $28 million of net pretax securities gains. This equates to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. The gains pertain to a variety of TruPS CEOs that M&T obtained during our acquisition of other banks over the past number of years, primarily through the merger with Provident Bankshares in 2009. All were marked to fair value through acquisition accounting and under section 619 of the Dodd-Frank act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, divestiture of most of these securities would otherwise have been required prior to July 21, 2017. ","Turning to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $865 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.05%, down 8 basis points from 3.13% in the linked quarter. During the quarter, we had another increase in average trust deposits which we placed at the Fed. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were $9.7 billion during the past quarter compared to $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Those deposits are modestly additive to net interest income, but we estimate a diluted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during the quarter.","Also, with the acquisition of the Hudson City mortgage loans, we have a higher proportion of assets with the 30 over 360 day pricing basis on our balance sheet than we had previously. That has the impact of diminishing the reported margin in a 92-day quarter, such as the one that just ended. We estimate the impact on the margin was about 2 basis points. Several other items included in net interest income, including prepayment fees and interest on nonaccrual loans which individually aren't large, in the aggregate reduced the margin by approximately 1 basis point. What we would consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline. As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, we began to take action to reprice the Hudson City deposit base to be more in line with the market and we began those efforts in mid-August. This benefits the margin immediately but will take another few quarters for the full impact to be realized as time deposits reach their stated maturity.","Average loans increased by about 3% on an annualized basis or $577 million compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat, with the usual seasonal decline in auto floorplan loans offset by about 4% annualized growth in other C&I loans. Commercial real estate loans increased by about $1.1 billion or 15% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 13% annualized rate. And consumer loans grew at an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect loans, including indirect auto loans, being offset by a decline in homes equity lines of credit.","Regionally, we've seen the highest growth rate in commercial loans in New Jersey, coming off what is admittedly a low base. Growth in the adjacent New York City\/Tarrytown\/Philadelphia markets continues to be strong as well. Only Pennsylvania stood out as having a below-average growth this quarter. Average core consumer deposits which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased at an annualized rate of 8% from the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of trust and savings deposits, partially offset by lower levels of time deposits.","Turning to noninterest income, noninterest income totaled $491 million in the third quarter, up from $448 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, noninterest revenues grew 3% from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $104 million in the recent quarter, $14 million higher than in the linked quarter. Total residential banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $67 million compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $836 million in the quarter, down about 3% compared to the second quarter, but with a higher gain-on-sale margin.","Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $37 million compared with $24 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong origination activity. Trust income was $119 million in the recent quarter compared to $120 million in the previous quarter. Recall that in the second quarter's results, included were $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that did not recur in the third quarter. New business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business. Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, improved from $104 million in the second quarter, reflecting seasonal strength as well as the benefit from new customers.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the third quarter which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $743 million compared with $726 million in the prior quarter. The FDIC assessment increased by $6 million to $28 million as the assessment surcharge on banks over $10 billion in size came into effect. Other costs of operations increased by $10 million on an operating basis compared to the second quarter. That increase reflects higher advertising expenses to capitalize on the competitive changes occurring within our markets as well as higher professional services which include legal.","The efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.1% in the previous quarter. The comparable figure was 57.1% in last year's third quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remained stable, with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans declined by $11 million to $837 million at September 30 and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 93 basis points, improved from 96 basis points at the end of the second quarter. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $41 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter. Reflected in the recent quarter's charge-offs was $12 million associated with a commercial loan to a commercial maintenance services provider.","Recall that the second quarter's results included a sizable $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the third quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past two years. The provision for credit losses was $47 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $6 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. ","The allowance for credit losses was $976 million at the end of September. The ratio of this allowance to total loans was 1.09%, little changed from the 1.10% at the end of the second quarter. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $317 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $282 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.76% compared to 11.01% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects earnings retention less $350 million of share repurchases during the quarter, $110 million in dividends paid during the quarter, as well as the impact of net asset growth. Turning to the outlook, the trends in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we've seen over the course of 2016. At this point, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains little changed. We expect run-off of the mortgage loan portfolio to continue but be more than offset by growth in commercial and other consumer loans.","We expect a normal seasonal rebound in auto floorplan balances. The pipeline of customer activity in other parts of the C&I portfolio remains strong. We expect continued pressure in the core net interest margin in the area of 2 to 3 basis points. But as we saw this quarter, changes in the level of trust deposits, the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits and other items can result in some volatility in the printed margin. In any case, we expect growth in net interest income to continue to be challenged while we transition our New Jersey operations to a commercial banking profile amidst the ongoing difficult interest rate environment. On expenses, our outlook for spending in the second half of 2016 is that it will approximate spending in the first half.","Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing any significant pressures on credit, either in nonaccrual loans or in charge-offs. And we remain on track with our capital plan, with the pace of repurchases a little more weighted toward the second half of 2016 and a little less in the first half of 2017. ","As is our normal practice, we'll share our thoughts on the outlook for 2017 in the July earnings conference call. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. At this point, we'll open up the call to questions, before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Let's start off with the margin. I heard what you said, the 2, 3 basis points of core compression, but it sounded like there was also about 5 basis points in this quarter of other items that caused NIM compression. When you look at fourth quarter potential NIM, like, is there other items? I know you said it's going to be volatile, but does that 5 basis points negative that you had this quarter actually come back? Or is it basically just gone and it's going to remain at this lower level; and then those other items are sort of neutral, plus or minus, if that made sense?","Darren King","Yes, so good question. I know there's a lot going on in the margin. If we think about the basics and the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the run-off in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly we priced the CD book; as well as just as older loans that are at a higher-margin pay off and the newer ones that are at a slightly lower margin become a bigger part of the portfolio, you're seeing that compression.","If you look at the 2 basis points that happened because of the trust demand deposits, it's really literally that extra $1 billion that was being kept at the Fed. So those $1 billion carry a very low margin. You know, we're not receiving much on them, but we're not paying much on them. Those are just a different form of payment for our global capital markets business.","And then the other piece was obviously the mortgage portfolio being a bigger chunk of our balances and the pricing convention there being 30\/360 -- that when you have a quarter like we did, the interest paid by the customer doesn't change, but the basis over which you calculate the effective rate or the margin drops. So I guess we kind of look at that as what I would call noise. You know, how much cash at the Fed and trust demand deposits will be in the next quarter, I guess it's our anticipation that they will go down, but that's something that is subject to move quarter to quarter based on the activity we have in that business.","Ken Zerbe","All right. And then just the other question I had on the provision expense, I think in the release, you did talk about the normal seasoning of the non-purchase-impaired loans at Hudson City. If that deteriorates, just normal seasoning of the Hudson portfolio, does that have a meaningful impact on your allowance or the provision expense that you might take? Because it sounds like credit is still pretty good, but it was maybe a little bit higher than what we were looking for this quarter.","Darren King","I guess when I look at the total provision, if you look at charge-offs, charge-offs was just, you know, normal course of business. And when we look at what's in our allowance for doubtful accounts, as well as when we look at what's not performing, we don't see anything in there that gives us cause. In fact, it looks pretty good. The provision over and above charge-offs was the reflection of the loan growth we saw this quarter and just following our normal practices of providing for future losses, based on our historical charge-offs at rates by loan category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I was wondering if you could talk about expenses beyond the fourth quarter, either explicitly or just some of the puts and takes, as we think about investment spend. You know, maybe there was less investment spend on the technology side, but you're still ramping in New Jersey; kind of normal inflation; and then kind of some of the expense efforts that you have as well as partial offsets?","Darren King","Sure. So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year, in the course of the last year we've added some people; we've invested in some businesses. In growing global capital markets business, we've hired a couple of teams over the course of the year. And we're investing, as you noted, in New Jersey.","We think that we'll continue to make investments as appropriate, but probably the pace will slow down a little bit -- that we wouldn't maintain the pace that we were this year versus 2015 when you think about salary and benefits. When you look at some of the other costs of operations, I mean, occupancy obviously will go with people, but that should be pretty much contained. One of the places where we did spend more money this year was advertising and promotion. It was probably a little bit elevated compared to what would be a normal run rate for us, because we were making a splash in New Jersey as we went in there as well as we were taking advantage, as we've talked about, of some of the changes in the marketplaces that we operate in that have been happening.","So I guess absent other changes happening, our expectation would be that that would come back down. Probably not all the way to where it was in prior years, because we're now a bigger organization with New Jersey, but below the place where we're today. And when we look at the other professional services expenses that are out there, our pace of IT investment, I think, won't get higher from where we're right now. We're looking at the additions we have made to the technology team as well as to outside help -- that we think the run rate we're at is a good place. ","And we might actually slow it down a little bit so that we're able to manage the change that we're introducing into the Bank so that we can do things well. So I guess I don't see those dropping dramatically, but I don't see them going up from here. And then, obviously, the other wildcard is legal which is part of the professional services. And we will continue our work there as we get ready to go to trial which has been extended until October of next year.","Matt O'Connor","So not to put words in your mouth, but if you take what you just mentioned which all seem positive in terms of moderating expense growth -- if you take those positives, is that enough to offset kind of the normal inflation, so that you start looking at kind of flattish costs as we think about full-year 2017?","Darren King","It's a good question. I guess we're still doing our work on our 2017 plan and looking through what we were expecting. So I don't want to comment on what the 2017 numbers will look like. We'll give you more guidance in January. I think actually in my remarks before, I said July. I'm not going to keep you guys until July before we let you know. But we'll give you little better view on that in January.","But in general, our expectation is to try and make sure that we can manage our expenses in conjunction with revenue. Right? And our long term goal is always to try and produce positive operating leverage. There will be quarters and years where that might go negative or to zero, but over the long run that's really what our objective is. So we're trying to make sure that we align our expense growth to the revenue world that we're operating in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","First, I wanted to follow up on the comments on the buildup of the trust deposits. Short term liquidity looks like it's just around $11 billion. How much do you realistically need to run the Bank? And is there any plan to move at least some of that liquidity into the securities portfolio?","Darren King","Sure. You noted something that we've been paying attention to and had a lot of discussion on around here over the last little while. There's a bunch of components within that $12 billion. We certainly don't need $12 billion to run the Bank, that's for sure. When we look at what we need for HQLA and for the LCR, that number is maybe between $3 billion and $5 billion. And I think the question of whether it's $3 billion or whether it's $5 billion is really a function of what we think we can invest it in and the securities world.","And for us, when we look at investing it in two-year treasuries at 70 basis points or just keeping it at the Fed at 50, right now we're kind of more inclined to leave it in the Fed. Now, other components of that $12 billion include primarily two things. One is trust demand deposits. And when you look at those, either we or the customer that we're holding those on their behalf, we can either choose to put them in the Fed or we could put them in the money funds which is what would have happened historically. I think as rates start to come back there, trust demand deposits will sit as much or more in the money funds as it will sit in the Fed.","And either we'll do that on behalf of the customer or the customer will choose to do it themselves. And then we won't get those dollars as payment; we'll get paid in fees in our global capital markets business. And then the other part of what's at the Fed is some escrow balances that come with the relationship we have with Bayview and the servicing that we do. And those are monthly P&I payments.","So there's a floor that we see every month and that we'll look to put to work. But there's some part of those balances that grow throughout the month until the payments are made and then they drop back down. And we think the most prudent thing to do with those, certainly, right now is to just keep those at the Fed.","So really, when we look at those balances, we're thinking about those three categories. And we're looking to try and optimize what we have to make sure that we're not putting funds at risk, but we're getting as good a return as we can on those dollars.","Steven Alexopoulos","Regarding the high-cost CDs maturing from Hudson City, can you quantify the balance of these maturing in the fourth quarter and if you know at this point what 2017 looks like? And how will the rate that you're paying change on those?","Darren King","There's a couple of factors that are involved in the Hudson City deposits and I'll do my best to give you some guidance on how to think about it. So in the fourth quarter, there's, I think, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that will mature. And they are across a number of different term buckets. And what we've seen so far as we have started the repricing is that approximately 50% of the CDs are renewing and they are renewing typically at a lower rate.","And that could come in two forms. It could be at a lower rate within the existing term or what we're also seeing is people shifting to shorter term. Just because of the interest rate environment we're in, I think the book is generally short for us. I think it is for folks in the industry, because people are uncertain. So some of the dollars will reprice into CDs of light term or shorter term.","Some of those CDs will actually change categories and will go into money market accounts or even now accounts, again, while people wait out the interest rate environment. And then some of those are attriting. In total, we're retaining about 60% of the balances across all categories and about half are staying within time deposits of various maturities.","Steven Alexopoulos","That's helpful. Anything on 2017 at this point?","Darren King","Nothing at this point that I would comment on. I think we're kind of looking to see -- we're learning through this process. The good news is so far what we've seen is pretty much on track with what we expected to happen. But this is a big quarter, so I would like to see how that goes. And we'll continue to decide how we want to play things out in 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Just a follow-up on the Hudson City question in terms of deposits. Darren, if you are retaining 60% of those balances, what sort of percent are you seeing, I guess, the most favorable outcome -- where you'll get lower time deposit, maybe, but you'll get the primary checking account relationship to come over?","Darren King","Last numbers I looked at on that were we're getting about 20% to 25% of those customers adding a checking account. Now, when they add the checking account, that's great, as long as they are active. So one of the things that we spend a lot of time looking at is the activity rates of our customers and their accounts. And for us that means, do you have a debit card and do you use it regularly? Do you get direct deposit? And while the rate of people signing up for that account is off to a good start, the activity levels are a little bit lower than we'd like.","So as we work our way through this, our objective is to get what we would call primary households, where people view us as their primary bank. And those are the measures that we would tend to look to. So we do have a part of the 25% of the 50% that are opening checking accounts. And the results are decent, but we're going to keep watching that to see how things play out.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay, but that's 25% of the 60% you are retaining that are opening--?","Darren King","Correct.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. And then just secondly or lastly, just in terms of commercial loan growth, I don't know if you guys have quantified it for the year; I guess you'd require at least mid-single digits to offset the run-off in Hudson City. But is there a potential outperformance there? Can we read anything into this particular quarter -- the particular strength acceleration we saw in commercial this quarter versus the previous linked quarter?","Darren King","I guess we didn't realize going into the quarter, as we were going through it, that it was going to be as outperforming as it might look at this point. We've just kind of spent our time talking to our customers and helping them out. When we look at some of the commercial real estate growth this quarter, there was some construction which are projects that we had agreed to finance in prior quarters that were coming on stream and building which helped drive some of the growth.","And then obviously we're trying to grow in New Jersey which is a place where we did see some outsized growth -- although I'll remind you that the percentage looks good, but it's off of a small base. But overall, when we look at our pipeline, the pipeline is strong. It's slightly above what we had seen in prior quarters. So we feel good going into the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't want to characterize it as we're expecting to see outsized growth, at least vis-a-vis the industry.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. I guess it's mostly, I guess, with the smaller banks, but there's some regionals that also you see some concentration issues, certainly, with CRE. And just wondering if that maybe is a tailwind for M&T?","Darren King","Well, I think you're certainly hearing more people worry about the concentration limits. And I think that's certainly a concern. I read through some of the other comments from other calls and I recognize that's a concern. We obviously pay attention to that as well. And when we look at where we stand today, we feel pretty good about the headroom that we have there.","But I guess the important thing for us is that we try to do business, particularly in the commercial real estate space, with customers with whom we have a long history of doing business. The equity that's in the deals is still very strong and as strong as it was pre- the last recession or stronger than that.","And our credit appetite isn't changing. We're not lowering our standards, because we're seeing maybe a little bit more activity and we're not increasing it. We try to be very consistent with how we underwrite and what our expectations are in all parts of the cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","Just a housekeeping type of question around the loan growth. I noticed the EOP, the end-of-period, balances were higher than the average balances on a couple of fronts on most of the buckets. And just wanted to get your take on what is the better number to look at in terms of what it could mean for growth into next quarter?","Darren King","I guess my bias is always to look at the average rather than the end-of-period, just because when deals close can be lumpy throughout the quarter. You can get stuff that happens at quarter-end for various reasons. I would tend to look at the average; that normalizes out things that might show up. One month it might get participated out. So I think that's a better measure to use and the one that we would probably pay more attention to.","I guess the only thing to remind everyone of is -- the fourth quarter, there always tends to be a little bit of a spike, as our customers reach year-end and they are trying to get things done in a certain tax year. That's often a driver of activity to get deals done or loans closed. And we've historically seen a little bit of a spike at the end of the fourth quarter. So I would just pay attention to that.","But it's usually late in the quarter, so from an average perspective -- again, you know, it won't necessarily drive income in the quarter, but it will give you a nice pop at the end of the period. So a long-winded way of saying I would tend to focus on the averages.","John Pancari","No, that's helpful; it helps to account for it. I mean, it looks like it amounted to about $1 billion this quarter. And sorry if you already alluded to this, but just want to get your take on borrower demand within the pure C&I space. We have had several of your peers flagging some apprehension on the midmarket borrower side, given some uncertainty around the elections, but a little bit more by way of economic trends -- CapEx pulling back, industrial production weakening. So I wanted to get your thoughts there. Thanks.","Darren King","I guess from speaking with our commercial bankers across the region before coming on the call, they are feeling good about the demand that's out there. You know, as I mentioned before, our pipeline is very, very strong. It's in line with what we've seen in prior quarters. I think there is a little bit of a pause and I expect there will be a pause this quarter, as we go through the election cycle and people digest what that means and with the change in administration.","And the more global trend that we've seen this year and have for the last couple of years is companies of all sizes are sitting more on cash and they are holding that cash. And they are investing, but they are still reticent to invest beyond maintaining where they are. We're not seeing a ton of CapEx for growth and a bunch of the replacement cycle is gone. So I guess I would describe it and think about it as steady.","And the growth that we had in the quarter, I think, is fairly consistent in the ex-floorplan space, consistent with where we've been in the prior quarters. And we don't see a huge reason for that to change in the fourth quarter, either up or down.","John Pancari","One last question, it's a quick one, as well. But in terms of your expectation there on the margin for the 2 to 3 basis points of compression, this might be a stupid question, but is that for the quarter for 4Q? So that's a quarterly pace or are you expecting that to occur over a couple of quarters?","Darren King","That's been a quarterly pace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Can I ask just a bigger-picture question, a follow-up on the balance sheet? You mentioned it's been tough -- it looks tough to grow NII from here. But I was just wondering, when you think about the size of the balance sheet, you had good period-end loan growth. You had higher securities balances at period-end. You had the good deposit growth.","Do we see kind of the bottom in NII after a couple of quarters of decline? It would seem that you still have the balance sheet growth to overcome the NIM pressure. I just want to make sure I'm understanding the back-and-forth between balance sheet size and the output that is NIM.","Darren King","Right. So I guess as we look at what's been going on with net interest income, we think we're approaching the bottom and that it will start to turn. How quickly that turns will be obviously a function of whether we get a rate increase in December or not. But even absent that, we expect it to start to turn in the next couple of quarters. Part of the issue is -- and I think this is pretty straightforward for everyone -- as the mortgages run off, the reason they are prepaying is because they tend to be right around 4% and those are fixed yields; whereas the commercial loans that we're replacing them with in the short term with LIBOR, where they are being LIBOR-based, are at yields that are kind of 3.50% to 3.60%.","So that's part of what is driving that core compression. But as the mortgage balances become a little bit less of a factor in the balance sheet, that's why we see that bottoming out coming in in the coming quarters and expect to happen in 2017 and see things go the other way.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And as a follow-up to that point, this is the first quarter where we'll see the full-year effect of having Hudson City on. In the first quarter of last year, when we got the rate hike in December, it was tough to kind of understand the melding in of the benefit from rates versus the merging in of the Hudson City balance sheet.","So can you help us just understand the rate sensitivity? If we got a December hike, how does that carry forward? And would that also help -- how much do you think that would help the NIM on the new balance sheet?","Darren King","Sure. I guess a couple of things, I'll remind you that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had two months of Hudson City and in December was when we did the balance sheet restructuring. So it's a true statement that fourth quarter to fourth quarter, Hudson City will be in both; but it's not a full fourth quarter. And there was some balance sheet restructuring that we were doing in the fourth quarter of last year with Hudson City.","So I think the best comparison for you will be the first quarter 2016 to first quarter 2017. Now, that said, the impact of a rate hike on net interest margin, I think, will be pretty similar to what we saw last time. If it's 25 points, it won't be the whole thing that will show up in the margin. Obviously, deposit pricing, deposit price reactivity will impact that.","We're not sure that it will be that much this time as well. But I think a good guideline would be to look at what happened last time. And we would be right around that for the next hike. And we'll all keep our fingers crossed that it comes.","Ken Usdin","Yes, that's the tricky point, just because the balance sheet is different and we couldn't quite see that happened fourth to first. Do you have kind of what you think that would be in, like, a basis point helper?","Darren King","I guess I would be thinking in the 15 to 20 range.","Ken Usdin","15, 20 basis points on the quarter or on a full year?","Darren King","Well, you have to have it, obviously, for the full year. The full-year impact.","Ken Usdin","A full-year impact of one hike? Okay.","Darren King","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just had a follow-up to Steve's line of questioning. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give the rate at which the CDs are repricing -- or, rather, the rate that you're offering -- the new rate that you're offering the Hudson City CD holders?","Darren King","We didn't talk specifically about the rate. We talked about the rate at which they tend to be renewing which -- we're seeing approximately 50% of the CDs stay in the Bank. Those are staying across a number of term buckets. Not all customers are renewing in the same term. And so the rates vary, obviously depending on which term they're in.","In general, those are lower than what they were before. But the customer can get a different rate depending on the breadth of their relationship. So it's a little bit all over the board. There's not one rate, per se, that we're seeing those CDs go into.","Erika Najarian","So when I just looked at your website and I look at an Ally bank or a GS bank, there's a huge difference between what the rate is on the M&T website and the rate that others are offering that would attract CD holders. And I'm wondering, as we think about the renewal rate, is the mix of all of those buckets that you talked about sort of -- is somewhere in between? I think I'm getting 10 basis points just doing a quick search on your website across different terms. And for GS and Ally, I'm getting 1%.","Darren King","I think that's pretty accurate with where pricing is on some of the CDs. I think when we're dealing with customers who are single-service CD customers, oftentimes there's a better option for them. We're a relationship bank and our best pricing is for our best customers and those have more fulsome relationships with us. So we certainly have customers who earn much more than that on their CD balances.","We're obviously also sensitive to the market in which we're operating. We know it's broader than just the local market, that the Internet banks are part of it. But for certain customer segments that's not an option they choose to use. So we look at our pricing all the time and make sure that we feel good about where our pricing stands vis-a-vis the competition as well as doing the right thing for our customers and doing the right thing for our balance sheet.","So there's a bunch of things that we're always trading off when we're looking at pricing, but the rates that are there are certainly the posted rates that are in the market and, we think, comparable to other like institutions.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one last follow-up question. I wanted to make sure I understood -- you only need $3 billion to $5 billion of the $12 billion in cash to run the Bank. And as we think about the comments you made on the variability of escrow and trust deposit inflows, how much do you benchmark per quarter in terms of how much cash you have to hold to account for the volatility of those inflows and outflows?","Darren King","I guess I go back with the -- the main thing that we were running the Bank for and holding the cash is obviously for the LCR and LCR purposes. And it's our intention to manage that number so that we've got ourselves covered, but without giving away interest income that we could otherwise get if we were able to invest that in securities that paid better than holding cash at the Fed. When it comes to the escrow balances, there are minimums that we need to have to make sure that we don't ever have ourselves in a position where we can't make those payments on behalf of the people that we're covering from a servicing perspective. There obviously is a cost to the holding those and we're cognizant of what the cost is. But that's also part of the pricing that we have with the people that we're doing that business.","Trust demand would be the same thing. I guess I think it's a -- the trust demand balances I look at as primarily a function of the interest rate environment that we're in right now -- that if we were in a different part of the cycle, where rates were -- you know, we'll see what happens if there's a 25 basis point hike. But certainly another 50 and I think the level of trust demand deposits that we see us carrying will start to get real small real fast. And we'd be down into the range of the $5 billion-ish that we're holding for HQLA. And even that we might start to haircut a little bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Just wanted to get a little more color on the consumer loan demand. We've seen across the industry greater demand across a number of consumer loan types -- not just auto, growing demand for card, growing demand for other types of consumer lending. I'm curious as to how you're feeling about that growth heading into 2017 -- fourth quarter in 2017? And is there -- what is the opportunity set within the HCBK customer base, not only to reprice the CDs, but possibly to sell them consumer loans?","Darren King","Sure. I think when we look within Hudson City customer base, we do see upside to selling consumer loans. That would be primarily credit card and home equity lines of credit. What we're finding within the CD customer base, at least, is it tends to skew a little bit older. And therefore our ability to penetrate that with home equity loans and cards isn't the same as it would be if we were dealing with a slightly younger crowd. But obviously we have got those mortgages that we look at as well.","And if we have someone that has a mortgage, those would be good candidates for, certainly, home equity lines of credit. So we're cognizant of that and we're working on it. But is that going to drive double-digit growth? I don't think so. I think what you're seeing in our home-equity growth is not dissimilar to what you're seeing in the industry. And really, with 30-year rates and 15-year rates as low as they are, the average consumer is much more interested in doing a first than using a second. We would only start to see second balances and demand start to increase as rates increase, when people can't utilize the first lien market as their primary option. You know, when you talk about auto loans, for us and, I think, the industry, that tends to generally work through the dealerships.","We've been operating in New Jersey even prior to having Hudson City. And we have reps there that are working with dealers, dealerships and dealer groups, to try and be in their set of options. I don't think you would look at New Jersey -- I certainly wouldn't -- and say that's a big opportunity that will drive our indirect auto business growth beyond the rate that we've been seeing over the last few quarters.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And just to follow up on a comment you made earlier, I just want to make sure we're clear on the benefit of the one rate hike that you're talking about. You mentioned a 15 to 20 basis point benefit over the course of 12 months from the 25 basis point hike that we hope will occur in December, but we didn't see that last -- we haven't seen that over the course of the past 12 months.","I appreciate there's been a whole lot of moving parts over the last 12 months, but should we assume that the 25 basis points that we might get in December would add, all else being equal, 15 to 20 basis points to the margin by the fourth quarter of 2017? Or are there other moving parts that could diminish that?","Darren King","I'm glad you came back to that, because it was something that I wanted to come back to as I thought through the moving parts and the answer. So I think the 15 to 20 -- you start to see that work its way through the loan book, but sort of thinking about the whole part of the impact on the liability repricing as well. And I think when you net the two together and you look at what happened last time, you'll probably net more in the 6 to 10 range -- and that you see the pop early on and then it comes down.","Hopefully, it doesn't come down -- the reason for the range -- hopefully it doesn't come down quite as much as it has this time, because as the LIBOR rate moves up, what you're giving up from the mortgages going into commercial loans isn't as big a gap as what it is today, given where rates are. And so that will affect it. And then, obviously, the other thing that will be part of the margin that's important to think about is in total how we fund the balance sheet, right? So we have some bank notes that are coming due next year that we'll issue; and depending on where the print is there, that will also impact the margin.","So I guess originally, as I was thinking about the question and my response, I was thinking more on simply the asset side. I think 6 to 10 in total margin is probably a better space to be -- which, again, I always look at what happened this past year, recognizing there was some noise in there, but that's probably a good guide.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","You've spoken quite a lot about the repricing of Hudson City deposits. But I guess if I look at time deposit costs in the quarter, they increased 5 bps, from 85 to 90 bps. So I wonder if you could explain what's been going on there -- if there's some accounting related to the merger or something like that that's caused that tick-up and how it flows through over the future quarters?","Darren King","Yes, so I think you hit the nail on the head -- that when the accounting acquired certificates of deposit -- the math is that if it's a 12-month CD and there's two months left, you basically mark it as a two-month instrument and you think about the interest rate as that. So as those CDs that were in partial paydown, if you will -- you know, they were less than their full maturity, the rate that we would see would be the marked rate. And then as they renew, you would go to the actual rate. And that's partly why you are seeing that increase in those time deposit accounts over the course of the quarters this year. We have talked before that the bulk of the book is less than a year.","So we should be pretty close to the end of that accounting happening and start to see more pronounced the effect of the repricing that's happening. But I would also remind you that the repricing happens every month. So in the first month, you see 1\/12th of it and in the second month you see 2\/12ths of it. So it takes a while for that stuff to work its way through. And it's also a function of how big the balances are that are maturing in each of those twelfths. And we started the work in the middle of August.","So really, we've got 1\/12th in the books so far in September and that's why the numbers that you're quoting are accurate and why they are not that impressive. But you got to start sometime in making those changes and we're starting down that path. And we think it's an important next step in the conversion we have of this thrift into a commercial bank.","Geoffrey Elliott","And in terms of that cost of time deposit inflecting, when are you thinking that takes place?","Darren King","I'm thinking that is a 2017 event, just based on the fact that it's on average 12 months or less. So I think you start to pass through that inflection point sometime late second -- or late first quarter, sorry, early second quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question for today. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Don MacLeod","Again, thank you for all participating today. And as always, if there are any clarifications on the items on the call needed or if you have any further questions, please contact our investor relations department at 716-842-5138.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Laurie, and good morning. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T\u2019s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I\u2019d like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. As we noted in the earnings press release this morning, M&T\u2019s results for the first quarter were quite strong; the result of work done in the last 12 months positioning the bank to respond to the environment that emerged in the first quarter. The rate hike back in December and again in March, combined with limited pressure on deposit pricing, has improved net interest margins across the industry, and M&T Bank was no exception.","Those actions were a major factor in the 26 basis point expansion of our net interest margin, and in turn, the 4% growth in net interest income, both compared to the prior quarter. We experienced our usual seasonal uptick in compensation-related expenses during the first quarter relating to equity and comp \u2013 and incentive compensation and employee benefits costs. Aside from that, expenses continue to be well controlled.","Credit remained stable, and as we signaled on the January call, we resumed implementation of our CCAR 2016 capital plan by purchasing $532 million of M&T common stock during the quarter as well as increasing the common dividend by $0.05 to $0.75 per share per quarter.","Before we turn to the details, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of M&T\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer, Mark Czarnecki, who passed away during the first quarter. Mark was a leader in the truest sense of the word, a mentor to many within the bank, the industry, and the community. For me personally, I can\u2019t thank Mark enough for the guidance, advice, and impact he has had on my career at M&T. He was the kind of banker and, indeed, the kind of person we should all aspire to be. We will miss him but appreciate all that he did to enrich our lives.","Now let\u2019s turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $2.12 in the first quarter of 2017 compared with $1.98 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1.73 in the first quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter was $349 million compared with $331 million in the linked quarter and up 17% from $299 million in the year ago quarter.","Net income in the first quarter was impacted by new accounting guidance for certain types of equity based compensation. Tax benefits derived from deductions from employee equity compensation based on changes to the stock price and which were formally reflected in Other Comprehensive income are now included as an offset to income tax expense on a current-period basis. Thus, the first quarter\u2019s results included tax benefit of $18 million or approximately $0.12 per common share.","Also recall that the fourth quarter 2016 results included a $30 million contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation following a large securities gain in last year\u2019s third quarter and a smaller gain in the fourth quarter. That contribution amounted to $18 million after-tax effect or $0.12 per common share. There were no merger-related expenses in either the first quarter of 2017 or last year\u2019s fourth quarter. However, results for the first quarter of 2016 included merger-related charges amounting to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share.","Also included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $5 million or $0.03 per common share, compared with $6 million and $0.03 per common share in the prior quarter. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.","M&T\u2019s net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $354 million, compared with $336 million in the linked quarter and $320 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.15 for the recent quarter compared with $2.01 in 2016\u2019s fourth quarter and $1.87 for the first quarter of 2016.","On a GAAP basis, M&T\u2019s first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.15% and an annualized return on average common equity of 8.89%. That compares with rates of 1.05% and 8.13% respectively in the previous quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity of 1.21% and 13.05% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.1% and 11.93% in the fourth quarter of 2016. In accordance with SEC\u2019s guidelines, this morning\u2019s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $922 million in the first quarter of 2017, improved by $39 million from the linked quarter. Net interest margin improved to 3.34%, up 26 basis points from 3.08% in the linked quarter. The single biggest impact to the margin, an estimated 12 basis points came as a result of the Fed\u2019s late-December rate action reaching its full run rate during the quarter, and to a lesser extent, the Fed\u2019s late-March action. A major component of that benefit can be seen in the 16 basis points increase in loan yields compared with the prior quarter.","The average balance of funds placed on deposit with the Fed declined by approximately $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting the combination of cash deployed into investment securities and lower levels of deposits received from fiduciary clients engaged in capital markets transactions. We estimate that this decline produced a benefit to the margin of about 7 basis points. Compared with the fourth quarter, the shorter 90-day first quarter increased the reported margin by an estimated 3 basis points. A favorable mix of interest-bearing liabilities benefited the margin by an estimated 4 basis points. This includes the maturity of higher-cost, long-term borrowings including those acquired in the Hudson City transaction as well as the continued runoff of higher-cost time deposits also acquired with Hudson City. Those were replaced by higher balances of noninterest-bearing demand deposits.","Average loans declined by less than 1% compared with the linked quarter. A slower rate of growth for commercial loans, commercial real estate, and consumer loans was insufficient to offset continued pay-downs of our residential real estate portfolio. In particular, commercial real estate loans originated for sale decreased to $75 million at March 31 from an unusually high $643 million at last year\u2019s end.","Looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were up approximately 7% annualized, commercial real estate loans increased by about 4% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 16% annualized rate and consumer loans grew an annualized 1%, which marks a continuation of the trend we\u2019ve seen for several quarters, with growth in indirect loans including auto and recreation finance loans being offset by lower home equity lines and loans.","Impacting the end-of-period consumer loans was the windup and dissolution of the auto loan securitization we did in the third quarter of 2013. This brought some $130 million of auto loans back onto our balance sheet during the quarter. Regionally, we saw the strongest growth in C&I loans in New Jersey; our New York Metro region, which includes Philadelphia; and the Mid-Atlantic. Commercial real estate activity remained strong in New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic but slowed notably in the New York Metro region. Home equity lending remained pressured across the footprint.","On an end-of-period basis, C&I loans declined approximately 1.4%. As I mentioned, the 1.3% end-of-period decline in commercial real estate loans was entirely due to an elevated level of commercial mortgages held for sale by our commercial mortgage banking group at December 31, 2016. Loans held for sale declined by some $568 million at the recent quarter end compared with the end of December. Otherwise, end-of-period CRE loans would have grown by a little less than 0.5%.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T\u2019s Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 declined by some $599 million from the fourth quarter, with higher levels of demand deposits offset by lower levels of interest checking balances and continued runoff of time deposits acquired with Hudson City. Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $447 million in the first quarter compared with $465 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $85 million in the recent quarter compared with $99 million in the linked quarter.","Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $727 million in the quarter, down about 4% compared with the fourth quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $58 million compared with $63 million in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $27 million in the recent quarter, down some $9 million from the prior quarter. Recall that the loan volumes originated for sale and resulting revenues in last year\u2019s third and fourth quarter were near all-time highs, a pace that is difficult to sustain.","Trust income was $120 million in the recent quarter, little change from $122 million in the previous quarter. The decline is largely attributable to seasonal factors as new business generation remained strong. Service charges on deposit accounts were $104 million, down just $1 million compared with the fourth quarter also reflecting seasonal elements.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were $779 million, compared with $760 million in the previous quarter, which included the $30 million contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation that I previously mentioned. As is normally the case, the comparison of first quarter with the preceding quarter reflects our typical seasonal increase in salaries and benefits relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, the 401(k) match, the HSA contribution, and the annual reset in FICA payments and unemployment insurance.","Those items accounted for approximately a $50 million increase in salaries and benefits from the fourth quarter. As usual, those seasonal factors will not recur as we enter the second quarter. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator, was 56.9% in the recent quarter. The ratio was 56.4% in the previous quarter and 57.0% in 2016\u2019s first quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains relatively stable. Nonaccrual loans increased by just $7 million to $927 million at March 31 and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans increased by 3 basis points to 1.04% compared with the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to see modest inflows of new, nonaccrual mortgage loans in the acquired Hudson City portfolio, which under the accounting rules, were 0 as of the date of the acquisition.","Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $43 million compared with $49 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the first quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past three years.","The provision for credit losses was $55 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $12 million, reflecting the continued shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City residential mortgage portfolio pays down. The allowance for credit losses was $1 billion at the end of March. The ratio of the allowance to total loans increased slightly to 1.12%, reflecting that higher proportion of commercial loans.","Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value-discounted acquisition, were $280 million at the end of the first quarter. Of these loans, $253 million or 90% are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital. As we signaled on our January conference call, we resumed share repurchases during the past quarter, in line with our work CCAR 2016 capital plan. In total, we repurchased 3.2 million shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $532 million. Those repurchases, combined with the reduction of the balance sheet and risk-weighted assets during the quarter, brought M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules to an estimated 10.66% compared with 10.7% at the end of the fourth quarter. The actions we took in the fourth quarter to refinance one of our series of preferred stock reduced quarterly preferred dividends by $2.1 million to $18.2 million, which is indicative of the run rate going forward.","Now turning to the outlook. As we're now three months into 2017, there's still reason for optimism. The Fed's actions on interest rates came faster than we and the market were expecting back in January. The result was that margin expansion happened somewhat earlier than we expected, which in turn led to better growth in net interest income. Loan growth, despite the optimism for change in a more business-friendly administration, has yet to materialize in a meaningful way. And while the pace of loan growth in commercial and consumer categories has slowed somewhat as expected, the pace of pay-downs in residential real estate hasn\u2019t slowed as customers look to lock in current rates in advance of any further increases in rates.","The net result is that our outlook for loan growth for the full year of 2017 is a little lower than it was in January in the lower single-digits area, the lower end of our range. Absent any further rate actions by the Fed, there is modest upside to the net interest margin due to the fact that rates move late in the first quarter. However, the ultimate margin is impacted not just by the Fed, but by competitive pricing, the amount of cash on the balance sheet and the mix of funding.","The higher interest rate environment continues to challenge mortgage banking, specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations. Consistent with other mortgage originators, we relaxed margins in the past quarters to sustain volume, which impacted gain on sale revenue. As we've noted previously, we have the capacity and the appetite for additional servicing or subservicing business should any opportunities present themselves. This could offer a potential offset for slower originations.","The outlook for the remaining fee businesses is unchanged for growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Our expense outlook is also unchanged. We continue to expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2017 compared to last year. We don't expect to match any upside to revenues with any material increase in investment activity.","Our outlook for credit remains little changed. However, we must constantly remind ourselves that credit has been benign for several years and that we should view credit more as a downside risk than an upside opportunity. Despite some modest pressure on nonperforming and criticized loans, our outlook for credit losses remains relatively stable.","As for capital, given our strong operating performance and solid capital ratios, it is our intention to continue with the second quarter distributions that were approved as part of our 2016 CCAR submission. Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Laurie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Okay good morning. Maybe if we could get into obviously, a really good result on the interest margin. I think your comment in there was that we should expect modest improvement in 2Q. I guess, is that correct? And then more specifically, can you talk about what you guys actually saw in terms of deposit repricing? Was there anything specific that allowed you to increase the noninterest-bearing deposit so meaningful? I mean is that sustainable? And should we expect that the deposit costs can be kind of stable from here?","Darren King","Sure. So there's a bunch of questions in there. I apologize, I didn't write them all down. So if I missed one, well we can come back to it at the end.","David Eads","Well, I mean, I asked \u2013 I only asked one, so I was trying to get them all in there together. I apologize.","Darren King","One question with 12 parts. That's fine. So on margin for the second quarter, we are anticipating a little expansion in the second quarter, and that's largely the result of having a full quarter's worth of the increase that happened in March with the Fed. So we didn't get the full quarter impact in the first quarter and we expect some of that to bleed into the second quarter.","When we look at the components of the margin, obviously, we're very pleased with how the margin went in the first quarter and how things reacted. Obviously, between the day count and cash balances, that was 10 basis points of the increase, right? So I kind of look at this more as 16 versus 26. And then, when you break those two down between the impact of funding costs and the repricing of the assets, the asset repricing, in effect, was about 12 basis points, which isn't far from what we've been signaling in terms of six to ten for a 25 basis point increase from the Fed.","Your specific question about deposits, when we look at where deposit pricing was in the quarter, what was helpful for us, as you could see in the numbers, is we continue to work through the Hudson City time deposit book. And we started that, really, in August, September of 2016. And you can only reprice that as fast as those time deposits mature. And when we look at the pace of maturities of those deposits, it is roughly the same. It runs kind of about $100 million a week. There might be a couple of weeks where we have some big repricing. But what we've seen is the average rate at which things are repricing from has come down in the last six months. So the amount of decrease we can get, we're starting to get lower, or it could get smaller through time, but we still think there's a little bit of opportunity for repricing there.","In terms of noninterest-bearing, I think, as we see some of those time deposits choose not to renew as time deposits, they're going liquid, some of that ends up in money market, some of that ends up and now in DDA while customers are deciding what to do. And then the other part of the interest-bearing to keep in mind is commercial balances, right? And commercial balances, we haven't seen as much pressure on pricing yet as what we anticipated. There's more there than there is on the consumer side, but not what we anticipated. And time will tell whether that mix is able to stay where it is today. Our expectation is that it will start to shift and that those balances will start to move likely into the money funds.","But the money fund industry has changed since the crisis, and the rates that you can get on government funds, which is where that money would likely go, haven't moved enough yet for that to move. So that's an indicator that we keep an eye on to gauge what we think might happen to those noninterest-bearing deposits.","David Eads","Right, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Just a question on the tax change. Can you just talk about how recurring that is? I mean, is that something that only happens in the first quarter? Does that happen throughout the year? I mean, really, should we expect a permanently lower tax rate kind of over time? I'm trying to understand the go-forward implications.","Darren King","Yes. It's basically predominantly a first quarter event, because that's when most of our equity compensation is paid and invested. However, there are still some stock options that are outstanding, that are now in the money that will expire over the next 12 months. And as people exercise those options, there's the opportunity for there to be what's known as a disqualifying disposition, which can help lower the tax rate. But by and large, I would tend to think of it as predominantly a first quarter event with a little bit of noise in the other quarters, but shouldn't move the earnings as much as what happened this quarter.","Ken Zerbe","You mean in next year's first quarter? Or\u2026","Darren King","Next year's first quarter. It should happen every year in the first quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. So this first quarter wasn't unusually large given the initial tax change, it was just simply this is how it probably is going to be on a go-forward basis in first quarter?","Darren King","Yes. So the thing to keep in mind, Ken, as you think through this, is this quarter was large because of the material increase in the stock price at the end of the year. And the way it works is it's the difference between the share price when it is issued and the price when it vests. So when you have a big gain when the price at vesting is higher than the price at its issuance, that increases your expenses and reduces your tax liability. The reverse can also happen, right?","So if the stock happens to be lower at vesting date than what it was when it was issued, then your expense will go down and your tax liability will go up, right? So what the effect this is going to have \u2013 it\u2019s not really changing what\u2019s happening in actuality, it\u2019s just where on the financial statements it\u2019s happening. It used to go through OCI and hit the equity line, and now it\u2019s going through the income statement.","So it\u2019s going to create that volatility. It can move things positively or negatively, and it will tend to be disproportionately in the first quarter of the year for M&T.","Ken Zerbe","Great. All right, thank you.","Darren King","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Darren King","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Back to the loan growth topic. Thanks for the color around your updated expectations on loan growth. I just want to get a little bit more color on the granularity. In terms of the pace of the incremental runoff in the resi mortgage book, how should we expect that pace to play out? And then on the commercial side, the C&I growth outlook, if you could just talk a little bit about that, where you\u2019re seeing some weakening in demand, if you are. And then lastly, on CRE, where the pay-downs are and if you could quantify them at all. Thanks.","Darren King","Okay. Boy, this \u2013 you guys really learn from Don about asking one question with multiple parts. So on residential real estate, we\u2019ll start with that. If you look at the pace of decline in those balances, we do expect it to moderate somewhat as we go through the year, but that will be a function of where interest rates move and, in particular, the 30-year. The book is also getting smaller.","So the percentage pay-down as a percentage of a smaller balance will also come down. We had kind of run in the range of $900 million a quarter through 2016. I think we\u2019re a little under that this quarter, around $800 million. We do expect that to start to slow down as we go through 2017. To give an exact number, obviously, is a little difficult given where pay-downs are, but I would be thinking, I guess, in the kind of $600 million to $800 million a quarter range would probably be a good starting point. When we talk about C&I lending for the quarter, demand was strongest kind of along the eastern seaboard.","And if you look really from New York down through Philadelphia, Baltimore, Greater Washington, that tended to be where the bulk of the activity was. Certain sectors were particularly strong. Accommodation and food services were fairly strong, as was some health care and social assistance sectors. When we look at the pipeline that we have, the pipeline is actually reasonably strong.","It\u2019s within the range of where it was at the first quarter of last year, we\u2019re just not seeing people go to actually take out the loans. So we have approved loans on the books or in the pipeline, and we\u2019re waiting for customers to actually go through with those borrowings. When we talk about commercial real estate and what\u2019s going on there, probably the biggest thing that we\u2019re starting to see is within our construction book, that we had an increase in construction balances during 2016, the result of loans that were originated during 2015 as well as early 2016.","And as those projects reach completion, then they will become permanent mortgages, either with us or with someone else. And if we \u2013 if you see some slowdown in absolute commercial real estate growth, which we kind of expected this year, it\u2019s being driven substantially by a reduction in construction balances.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, thanks. Is your loan growth guide low single digits on average balances or EOB?","Darren King","On average balances, and that\u2019ll be across everything. So C&I, CRE, consumer and residential real estate.","John Pancari","Yes, okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Ricky Dodds","Hey, guys. This is Ricky Dodds from Matt\u2019s team. Congrats on the good quarter. Just a bigger picture question. I was wondering if you have any update on the AML issue and if there\u2019s any timetable for a resolution.","Darren King","Well, we are now substantially complete in our work on the AML\/BSA in the written agreement, and we are having our work reviewed by a regulator and hope that they will agree that we\u2019ve done everything we said we would in the time frame, and that we\u2019ll be hopeful for a positive outcome sometime this year.","Ricky Dodds","Okay, great. And then another bigger picture question, if that\u2019s okay. A number of your peers have talked about a lot of migration towards the digital and sort of enhancing the customer\u2019s digital experience. Can you just remind us again what you\u2019re doing on that front and maybe provide a breakdown of what sort of transactional activity you\u2019re seeing at branches versus maybe a digital or online platform?","Darren King","Sure. So if you look at what\u2019s been going on, just to kind of step back and talk about what\u2019s happening with customer behavior and transaction patterns at branches, we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in teller-assisted transactions primarily for consumers over the course of the last four years. And that migration started actually four years ago, five years ago when we started to deploy image enabled ATMs.","And the pace of decline for consumer transactions has averaged kind of 8% to 10% per year decrease for consumer teller-assisted transactions. When we look at small business, it was also a very important part of our customer segment and active users of the branch, their transaction patterns have also decreased but at a much slower pace. It\u2019s kind of running 2% per year.","So the weighted average decrease is in the 6% to 8% range. If we look at how we continue to invest in alternative channels for our customers, obviously, last year, we updated the website and online access through any device, be it your PC, your tablet or your mobile phone. The foundation for those interactions was from that upgrade that we made to the website. We also, in the last quarter of last year, introduced our updated mobile app that also included mobile check deposit, and we\u2019ve seen strong adoption of the app and strong ratings online.","I think the average review is between 4 and 5 of that app and transaction activity there continues to increase. When we look at where early movement is happening on the mobile app, it is shifting as much or more from the ATM and ATM deposits to the mobile device as opposed to from the teller line to the mobile device.","Ricky Dodds","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning.","Frank Schiraldi","Just on the \u2013 just going back to the margin. Darren, I think you\u2019d talked recently about a 25 basis point increase, and I think you were specifically talking about March being worth anywhere from $70 million to $85 million, I guess, in NII for the full year. So I\u2019m just wondering, does that assume that the deposit betas pick up and so, at the very least, might be a little front-loaded in a world where deposit betas aren\u2019t necessarily picking up in the short term?","Darren King","Right. That\u2019s the right way to think about it. We \u2013 each 25 basis point increase from the Fed should be in that range that you quoted on an annual basis. And when we run our estimates, we do include some deposit pricing reactivity. And the more reactivity there is, you get closer to the lower end of that range and the less there is, obviously, you get to the higher end of that range. But it does tend to be front-loaded as you pointed out, because the assets reprice instantly off the index and the deposits take a little longer to reprice.","Frank Schiraldi","Great. And would you say you get most of that just from the short end moving and don\u2019t necessarily need the shift across maturities across the yield curve?","Darren King","Yes. For us, in particular, we\u2019re much more sensitive on the asset side to the short end of the curve.","Frank Schiraldi","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning Darren and Don. Thanks for taking my question.","Darren King","How are you Brian?","Brian Klock","Not too bad, not too bad, thanks. So thinking about the margin and the securities portfolio, you saw a nice 15 basis point pop in yield on the securities portfolio. I guess I wasn\u2019t expecting that sort of a pop this quarter. Can you talk about a little bit what you did there? Is there anything as far as extending duration or anything that you guys may have done within the securities portfolio to see that good pop in the yield?","Darren King","I guess the biggest factor was just the reinvestment activity and what was rolling off and the rates we were able to get with what we were reinvesting in. If you look at where we had been historically, it was largely a mix of 2-year treasuries and 15-year mortgage-backed securities. And if you look in the quarter, I think we did a little bit more MBS than we had previously, and we did a little bit more of 30-year MBS in proportion to what we had done in the past. But in general, when we look at the duration, the duration is relatively stable. It might be up a couple of months, but we haven\u2019t been looking to extend duration. That\u2019s not typically how we think about the securities book.","Brian Klock","And then so thinking about sort of new purchase yield versus roll-off, I guess, going forward, would that 6 to 10 basis points of NIM extension from the Fed, I guess, given where the tenures kind of come back here a little bit, is the expectation that, that 243 [ph] is somewhat flat here? Or does that still benefit going forward any new purchases?","Darren King","When I look at where we\u2019ve been, when I talk about that 6 to 10 in relation to the increase from the Fed, that\u2019s more on the asset side of the book and looking at our lending side and how \u2013 with the mix of assets that reprice off of LIBOR in relation to the deposit base, the impact of securities yields can move that around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but not more than 1 to 2 basis points. So I \u2013 no, I wouldn\u2019t look at the reinvestment risk and\/or the potential pricing we get from reinvesting the securities as having a material impact on that 6 to 10.","Brian Klock","Got it. And last question, sorry Don, and I think that\u2019s 2.5 I asked. But the $16 billion average securities balances, and there\u2019s a lot of excess liquidity back on the books at the end of the period, do you keep it at $16 billion? Or where would you like the securities portfolio?","Darren King","I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in that range. That number dropped down probably to its lowest levels, for us in the last 12 months last summer, post Brexit. But generally, right around $16 billion, I think, is where we would look to maintain it. Obviously, we\u2019ll adjust that depending on where we need to be for the LCR, but that\u2019s probably pretty good range as our target area as you roll forward.","Brian Klock","All right. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell","Good morning Darren and Don. Just, I guess, a single question in two parts, if I can, both on the margin. First of all, just in terms of the 6 to 8 basis points you would assume \u2013 or, sorry, 6 to 10 basis points that you would assume for a 25 basis point hike and your comments that a 25 basis point hike would be a little bit front end-loaded. If we think about that relative to the second quarter margin, it sounds like there\u2019s only a couple of basis points maybe that we should be thinking about in terms of margin benefit from the March Fed hike.","And then on the longer-term basis, you\u2019ve got about, by my calculation, a little over a couple of billion dollars of debt that needs to be refinanced by the \u2013 by \u2013 just after the first quarter of next year, and I guess I\u2019m curious what your thinking is in terms of how you might be able to refinance that at a lower cost and, therefore, further support the margin in late 2017 and into 2018.","Darren King","Sure. So when we look at the 6 to 10 guideline that we\u2019ve given for 25 basis points, we definitely saw some of the March hike in the margin in the first quarter. But again, because it kind of came so late in the quarter, we didn\u2019t see the full impact of that 6 to 10 in the quarter, so that\u2019s why we think there\u2019s some modest expansion still out there for the second quarter of 2017. When we look at the funding mix, you\u2019ll note when we went through the discussion of the margin earlier on in the call and we talked about 4 basis points of the 26 being on the funding mix, we had some long-term funding that rolled off in the first quarter that, because of where the balance sheet was, we didn\u2019t need to replace at that time.","But as we go through the second quarter, we have some other maturities that we\u2019ll be needing to fund in all likelihood during the second quarter. And depending on whether we go 5-year or 3-year, fixed or floating obviously will impact where the margin ends up in the second quarter. But it shouldn\u2019t be a material impact given where it looks like spreads are right now compared to what we think is rolling off.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. In the context of your remarks about credit being more of a downside risk at this point of \u2013 in the cycle, how does all the negative news flow we\u2019re seeing on the retail sector stack up in that? Where would you kind of place that in terms of your ranking of potential risks on the credit side? And then related to that, I think you\u2019ve got about $4 billion of CRE, which, in the 10-K, you note is retail and services-related. And I wondered if you could just give us a bit more granularity on what sort of exposures bleed into that and how it breaks down.","Darren King","Sure. So just on vehicle resale values, when we look at where the prices are coming in so far this year, they\u2019re down a little bit, but when we look at our loan-to-value when we originate loans, particularly in the auto space, we tend to be fairly conservative as well as the customer base that we have in the indirect auto space also is very prime-oriented. I think our average FICO score there is above 700. In fact, I think it\u2019s more like in the 730 range. So when we look at the vehicle prices, it\u2019s certainly a risk out there, but given how big indirect is as a part of our balance sheet and then the type of customer base that we have, we don\u2019t view that as a risk on the credit side, at least not when the \u2013 we see causing a lot of pain from a credit perspective.","When you look in the commercial loan space and you look at retail, when we would consider, I guess, true retail like shopping malls and strip plazas and that kind of thing, we wouldn\u2019t view it as $4 billion; we would view it as less, more like $1.5 billion. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019re paying attention to. When you look at retail, there\u2019s certainly certain chains that are exposed. From our experience when we look at retail real estate, what we found is that the A properties, top-level malls, have been doing okay and those have been performing well. And now surprisingly, a lot of the strip malls, which should almost be considered the C plazas, tend to be performing okay. It\u2019s the ones in the middle that seem to be struggling the most.","And when we look from our book and what we have, we feel very comfortable with the exposure that we have there, because we tend to be in the A or C space. And as a percentage of our book, it tends to be a smaller percentage, almost like the auto. My comment about credit was more just a reminder that, where we are in the cycle, we\u2019re at the low. And if there\u2019s a bias in anything that\u2019s likely to happen, there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s more likely that things will get worse. We\u2019re hopeful that the economy and the GDP keeps growing and that the changes that have been expected come to fruition, but it\u2019s our conservative nature to always be thinking more about where the downside can come from and managing that rather than counting on things to get better.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. My one question is on balance sheet growth. Darren, how should we think about average earning asset growth in context of the low single-digit growth that you told us you expect loans to grow? And also, as we think about the rest of the year, what an appropriate cash earning asset percentage would be to assume.","Darren King","Erika, I guess the way to think about it is that we\u2019re thinking low single digit in total earning assets, and that will be comprised of decreasing residential real estate assets in the range that we had talked about before. Obviously, that will move faster or slower, depending on where interest rates fall, particularly the 30-year. And we still anticipate low single-digit to mid-single digit growth in C&I and CRE as well as the other consumer loan categories. So that those \u2013 the combination of those four would end up with low single-digit total earning asset growth over the course of the year on an average basis.","Erika Najarian","Just the second part of the one question on the cash, cash as earning assets, is this $6 billion average unusually low? Or how should we think about the trajectory of that over time?","Darren King","That\u2019s a great question and one of much debate even internally that when you look back over the course of the last 12 months, I think our high was $12 billion, and that was when we had slowed down some of the reinvestment of the securities book that was paying off in the low rate environment. And we happen to have some increases in mortgage escrow balances as well as very active trust demand customer base. I think that number, if you just look historically, does have the most volatility and therefore creates that volatility in the printed margin. If I was looking at a range, I don\u2019t think 6 is a bad number. I would target 5 to 7, somewhere in there is probably a good starting point. But as we\u2019ve seen in the past, that number can move around a little bit from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to follow up on the comments around C&I lending because you mentioned customers wanted to have more credit available but then not drawing on their lines. What are you hearing from your lenders in terms of why they\u2019re staying on the sidelines here?","Darren King","Sure. So let me make sure I clarify the comment. Our pipeline of approved loans is approximately where it was in the first quarter of last year. So we haven\u2019t seen the pipeline deteriorate materially, but we\u2019ve seen people not following through to date and accepting those loans and moving forward. In general, when we talk to our RMs and talk to the customers, I think the general sentiment is one of optimism, but they\u2019re in kind of a wait-and-see mode. And they\u2019re just waiting, I think, for more certainty about which direction the administration is going to go and their ability to follow through on some of the promises around managing the costs of employees through things like the Affordable Care Act, but also some of the changes to minimum wage and overtime benefits from the FLSA.","We are hearing things about fiscal policy and whether that will pull through and when, which I think it\u2019s more a question of when and less a question of if. And it\u2019s those kinds of things that tend to be on the minds of \u2013 the tax reform is another thing that\u2019s on our customers\u2019 minds. So it\u2019s all the things that tend to be in the news. And the issue is \u2013 it isn\u2019t that optimism has waned, maybe a little bit, but it\u2019s more wait-and-see is kind of the feel that we get from our customers.","Steven Alexopoulos","And just a follow-up, could you give us a sense what was line utilization in C&I in the first quarter and how did that compare to last year? Thanks.","Darren King","Yes. Line utilization in the first quarter was just around 55%, slightly under. And when we look at where that is historically, it\u2019s towards the higher end of what we\u2019ve seen over the course of the last couple of years.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks and with the theme of two questions in one, I wanted to ask you and focus on noninterest-bearing deposits because, sequentially, it\u2019s up in an annualized pace of 20%, and from last year, it\u2019s up 15%. So I was curious if this is traction you\u2019re getting with the Hudson City market. They now roll out some of those products and services. And then the second part of this question is, have you looked at the excess balances? Because this represents a large part of your deposit base in relation as interest rates start to go up. What sensitivity might this balance have in the sense of the seeing some of those balances be redeployed? Thanks.","Darren King","So when we look at noninterest-bearing deposits and when we look at New Jersey in particular, we are seeing some growth there, but it\u2019s very modest. Most of our growth in New Jersey on the start has been on the asset side rather than on the liabilities side. We are seeing some migration of those time deposits into nonmaturities, either money markets or NOW accounts predominantly. When we look at that \u2013 the NOW accounts and DDA, there\u2019s a few things that are going on in there.","So last year, we were able to increase those balances through the mortgage servicing business that we increased with our partner Bayview and Lakeview. And those balances will move around based on their business, but those are also priced closer to markets.","So our ability to maintain those will be a function of the rate that we pay, and the rate that we're paying there is certainly competitive and higher than what we're paying in general. Within the DDA book, there's a sizable percentage that is commercial, and those commercial balances have been on the books since the crisis. And as our customers continue to manage their business, they're managing cash and holding it on the balance sheet. They haven't redeployed it yet.","And as we mentioned before, we're watching that because, as you point out, those will be more rate sensitive. But it's always going to be in proportion or in relation to what alternative they have to use that money for. So some of it, we think, will turn to plant equipment at some point and some of it will go into higher-earning assets like the funds. And then the other part of those non-interest bearing deposits that can move around from time to time is what comes in through trust demand balances from our fiduciary business, our global capital markets business and customers doing debt offerings or M&A activity.","So those are kind of the things that create some of the movement in those balances. It's definitely, to your point, something that we're paying a lot of attention to because those balances obviously affect our liquidity coverage ratio and will affect our need for funding, depending on what happens with asset growth. And if there's a place where margin can be impacted negatively, that's definitely a place that we're paying attention to.","Marty Mosby","What is the \u2013 if it's not coming from New Jersey, what\u2019s the source of the commercial growth in your traditional markets? It seems late in the cycle to see some of those balances growing as quickly as we're seeing here.","Darren King","We've seen some of it in our New York City, Philadelphia, Tarrytown marketplace, what we would refer to as kind of our metro markets, is where we've seen some good balance growth. And then, obviously, we've seen it generally across the board. I think, across all markets, we were up about 8%, but those were standouts. I mean New Jersey was a large percentage growth. But as I kind of remind people, it's off a small base, so it's not really what's driving the overall balance growth. But it's generally across the board for those customers. And we also see it from some of our commercial real estate customers as well.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks, good morning. Just a question on efficiency. Darren, I believe, last quarter, you talked about getting to the low end of 55% to 57% without additional hikes. And just granted that we got the March 1, just want to get your updated thoughts on the path of the efficiency ratio as you think about the full year and some of the balances of growth underneath that.","Darren King","We would continue to believe that the low end of that range is the right place to be thinking for the full year. Obviously, we got the rate hike in March. When we were looking in January, there was 2 hikes anticipated. So I guess we're up to 3. So we would be right in that range at this point, absent any other increases. But we've been very focused on making sure that expense growth stays contained and within the range that we had talked about, such that when we do get these increases in rates and we're able to grow our fee income that we should see the efficiency ratio at the bottom end of that range. And with any luck, it might dip a little bit below the bottom end, but that remains to be seen throughout the year. But I think that's good guidance.","Ken Usdin","And Darren, a follow-up. On that point, you mentioned, I think, just about \u2013 talking about a low growth rate in expenses this year. I know the first quarter a year ago only had 1 month of Hudson City. So can you help us think about like what the core expense base is really growing underneath that when we just think about fully phased-in Hudson City expenses?","Darren King","Just to remind you, last year's first quarter did have Hudson City in for the whole quarter. We closed in the fourth quarter of 2015, and it was the fourth quarter that had 1 month in. What we did have in the first quarter of last year were some merger-related expenses, some onetimes. I think the number's about $14 million that were in there. So if you look at where we were in the fourth quarter and you back out the seasonal compensation, that's roughly where we would expect to be in the second quarter. We might see a little bit of movement in professional services, but we wouldn't expect too much. But otherwise, the first quarter minus the seasonal comp ought to be the range for the upcoming quarters.","Ken Usdin","I misspoke. Thanks for correcting me, Darren.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Hi, Gerard, how you doing?","Gerard Cassidy","Good, thank you. The current legislation going through Congress, the so-called CHOICE Act 2.0, is talking about, obviously, changes to Dodd-Frank. And one of the changes they're proposing is to lift the SIFI designation to over $250 billion. Obviously, you guys were not following that camp. Assuming the SIFI designation is lifted up to a much higher level and you are not designated as a SIFI and the LCR goes with it, meaning you're not going to be held to an LCR ratio, how would that change the way you guys look at your balance sheet in terms of the cash you have to keep on it and some of the deposits that you're really focused on?","Darren King","Sure. So I guess when we look at the cash that's on the balance sheet, there's \u2013 we try to remind ourselves and everyone that there's really 3 components to the cash that's on our balance sheet. A bunch of it is related to the servicing business and those P&I payments and as they grow during the month, we invest that cash with the Fed because we have to remit those balances to the mortgage servicing or to the owner of the assets. When we also look in the cash balances, you see some of those trust demand balances, and again, those are short term in nature, so those sit at the Fed.","And then there's the remaining, which is really for LCR purposes. And so to be that incremental piece that we would look to manage a little bit tighter, and I think we would look at the amount of securities that we then hold, back to that question. I think that the trick, Gerard, is, in the short term, obviously, we would be below that SIFI designation but with aspirations to move towards that $250 billion mark. So just like with the CCAR and the stress test and many of the parts of begging that have been added, you don't want to tear everything down to 0 as you're on your path to those asset thresholds to only have to start over again when you get there.","So I think we would look to manage down the cash a little bit, manage down the securities portfolio, but I don't think we will go all the way back to where we were pre-crisis. I don't think that's a place where we can probably expect to run the bank again.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Good morning, thanks. Deposit pricing competition. I was wondering if you could just talk about it, what you're seeing in the New York market, and then competition on the commercial side versus retail for your deposits as well.","Darren King","Sure. So I guess when we look at where we've seen the most active pricing on the deposit side, it's been in the time deposit space, and it's been in kind of the 12-month time frame. When we look at the shorter end of the CD market, it's been reasonably competitive, and it tends to price a little bit above where non-maturity deposits are pricing, but the competition there hasn't been tremendous. And when you go further up the curve, in the 2-year to 5-year space, rates just haven't moved up far enough for customers to be willing to lock up their money for that time period. So you've seen most of the action in the 12-month space on the consumer side. The one thing that is a little bit different this time, I wouldn't call it a New York City phenomenon per se or a New York state phenomenon, but more what's going on with online. Lenders, the Allieds, the Capital One 136s of the world, the MXs. Of course, it tends to be the credit card-oriented banks that have the higher margins to pay, but that's where there's been a little bit more competition this time around compared to what we might have seen last time.","And on commercial balances, depending on the size of the institution that you're dealing with, the bigger ones obviously are much more active at managing their excess cash and looking to get a return because they have treasures that are focused on those things. As you move down the spectrum, it's something that our customers worry about, but their choices have tended to be either in their DDA to offset fees or sweeping those balances into the funds. And again, the fund reform has changed that equation a little bit. I just think rates need to go a little bit higher before we start to see more movement there, because the alternative isn't worth the change so far.","And the other thing that we haven't seen yet for us, and I don't think, talking to others in the industry, they've seen it as the impact of the repeal of Reg Q and the ability to pay interest on commercial deposits. That's something that's different from where we were pre-crisis and hasn't really played itself out yet. So I think there's a bunch of factors that are at play, particularly as it relates to commercial deposits, and we've got our eye on it, and we're looking through what alternatives we have to make sure we meet our customers' needs","Peter Winter","Great. And again, you're not seeing any differentiation in deposit competition in the New York City market versus other markets?","Darren King","Not that I can speak to. But our presence in Metro New York and Manhattan is relatively small, so in the grand scheme of where we have deposit pricing, it's not really impacting.

My name is Lynn, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Don MacLeod, you may begin your conference.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Lynn, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast.","If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules, from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those made on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.","The third quarter was a busy one for us, including our announcement of the acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp near the end of August, as well as M&T's final exit from the TARP program through the U.S. Treasury's sales of its investment in M&T through a public offering.","As we noted in the press release, this year's third quarter financial results reflect good progress from across most of our core banking businesses, as well as a very favorable mortgage banking environment. I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights, after which, Don and I will take your questions.","Turning to the specific numbers, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.17 in the third quarter of 2012, up 27% from $1.71 earned in this year's second quarter and up 64% from the $1.32 earned in the third quarter of 2011.","Net income for the third quarter was $293 million, up 26% from $233 million in the linked quarter, and up 60% from $183 million in last year's third quarter.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisition activity.","There were no merger-related expenses in the recent quarter's results. However, M&T's results for the second quarter of 2012 included related -- merger-related expenses of $4 million after tax or $0.03 per common share related to the Wilmington Trust merger.","GAAP earnings in last year's third quarter included $16 million of after-tax merger-related expenses or $13 per share also related to the Wilmington deal.","After-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets was $9 million or $0.07 per common share in the recent quarter, down from $10 million or $0.08 per share in this year's second quarter.","After-tax amortization expense was $11 million or $0.08 per common share in last year's third quarter.","M&T's net operating income for the third quarter of 2012, which as noted, excludes the merger-related expenses and the intangible amortization, was $302 million, up 22% from -- up 22% from $247 million in the linked quarter and up 44% from $210 million in last year's third quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.24 for the recent quarter, up 23% from $1.82 in the linked quarter and up 46% from $1.53 in the year-ago quarter.","Net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.56% and 21.53%, respectively, for the recent quarter, improved from 1.30% and 18.54% in the second quarter of 2012.","As usual, in accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and the income statement.","Taxable equivalent net interest income was $669 million in the third quarter of 2012, up $14 million from $655 million in the prior quarter. The net interest margin expanded during the third quarter, increasing to 3.77%, up from 3.74% in the second quarter.","Major items impacting the comparison in the linked quarter were as follows: An estimated 5 basis points of the improvement is attributable to a lower level of excess liquidity held at the Federal Reserve. Average funds on deposits with the Fed declined to $151 million in the third quarter, down from $1.17 billion in the recent quarter.","One additional day in the third quarter as compared with the second quarter reduced the margin by about 1 basis point. And what I would characterize as core margin compression was about 1 basis point as lower yields on loans were largely offset by the benefit from a lower level of long-term borrowings, which were placed by low-cost core deposits. This is consistent with our expectation of in and around 2 basis points of continued underlying margin compression per quarter.","Interest income recorded on acquired loans was little change from the amount in the linked quarter. I'll discuss our outlook for the margin towards the end of my comments.","As for the balance sheet, average loan growth for the third quarter continued to be relatively strong, increasing by approximately $1.6 billion to $63.5 billion or an annualized 10% growth as compared with the prior quarter.","On that same basis, compared with 2012 second quarter, changes in average loans by category were as follows: Commercial & industrial loans grew by $400 million or an annualized 10%. This included a seasonal decline in auto floor plan loans of about 5% annualized, which was more than offset by 12% annualized growth in other C&I categories. Commercial real estate loans grew by $257 million or an annualized 4% growth. Residential real estate loans were up by about $1.1 billion, reflecting the tail end of our program to retain conforming mortgage loan originations to hold on, on our balance sheet. We resumed our normal policy of selling the bulk of our conforming loan production at the beginning of September.","Consumer loans declined an annualized 4%, reflecting the same factors we've been discussing for some time now, our reduced appetite for Indirect Auto loans given the low absolute returns associated with them and our customers' reduced appetite for home equity loan.","On an end-of-period basis, loans grew by $1.3 billion or an annualized 8% compared to the linked quarter. Included in this figure was $7 million of annualized growth in C&I loans and the $1 billion increase in loans retained for -- in mortgage loans retained for investment.","Average investment securities continue to decline as our appetite for purchasing securities remains very low based on extremely modest yields that are available. Average core customer deposits, which exclude foreign deposits and CDs over 250, were up an annualized 9% as compared with the linked quarter.","The Upstate and Western New York region continues to benefit from the disruptions to customers and businesses impacted by the HSBC branch divestiture. Average loans in that region were up an annualized 14% compared to the linked quarter. Average commercial & industrial loans in that region were up by $291 million. And average CRE loans were up by $114 million. And while modest at 2% annualized growth, Upstate and Western New York was the only region with consumer loan growth.","Average core deposit growth in Upstate New York region slowed to an annualized 5% compared with the linked quarter. And then core deposits -- sorry, average core deposit growth was an annualized 5% growth compared to linked quarter, and core deposits are up 13% compared to last year's third quarter.","Turning to net interest -- noninterest income, noninterest income totaled $446 million in the quarter compared with $392 million in the prior quarter. The recent quarter's results included $5 million of securities losses including other than temporary impairment charges related to our investment securities portfolio, down from $17 million in the linked quarter. Excluding those losses from both periods, noninterest income was $451 million for the recent quarter, up 10% from $408 million in the second quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues rose by $37 million to $107 million in the recent quarter compared with $70 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans locked for sales to third parties more than doubled from $856 million in the second quarter to $1.8 billion in the third quarter. Commercial mortgage loan activity also remained strong.","Fee income from deposit services provided was $114 million during the recent quarter compared to $111 million in the linked quarter.","Trust revenues were $116 million in the recent quarter compared with $122 million in the prior quarter. Recall that last quarter's results benefited from seasonal tax preparation fees of about $4 million. In addition to the decline in the seasonal tax-related fees, fees from managing our proprietary funds declined by about $1 million as a result of the rate environment. The remainder of the decline related to the timing of receivables.","So looking back over the past year, we're pleased to note that trust and investment fees increased by 2% from last year's third quarter, reflecting our ability to retain customers throughout the integration of the 2 institutions.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses, which excluded merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets, were $602 million for the third quarter, down from $604 million in the second quarter and $619 million in last year's third quarter.","Included in the operating expenses for the third quarter was a $3 million addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the efficiency ratio, which excludes securities, gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization, and the merger-related gains and expenses was 53.7% for the third quarter compared with 56.9% in the second quarter of 2012.","While I would note that expenses were very well controlled during the recent quarter, the strong revenue growth trends were also a factor in the improvement in the efficiency ratio.","Let's turn to credit. Credit continues to improve. Nonaccrual loans decreased to 1.44% of total loans at the end of the third quarter, down from 1.54% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter.","Other non-performing assets consisting of assets taken into foreclosure of defaulted loans were $112 million as of September 30, also down from $116 million as of June 30.","Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $42 million, down from $52 million in the second quarter of 2012. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 26 basis points compared with 34 basis points in the linked quarter. This figure averaged 31 basis points for the first 9 months of 2012.","The Provision for Credit Losses was $46 million in the third quarter compared with $60 million in the linked quarter, and the provision exceeded charge-offs, and as a result, the allowance for credit losses increased to $921 million at the end of the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in the loan portfolio.","While the dollar amount of loan loss allowance increased, the ratio of allowance to credit losses to loans declined -- for credit losses to loans declined slightly to 1.44% compared to 1.46% at the end of the linked quarter.","Total loan-loss allowance as of September 30 was 5.5x annualized net charge-offs for the quarter.","We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from nonaccrual loans because they're deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say that there is a low risk of principal loss. Loans 90 days past due were $309 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $280 million or 91% are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Loans 90 days past due were $275 million at the end of this year's second quarter, of which 93% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","M&T's estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio improved to 7.47% at the end of September, up from 7.15% at the end of June. This reflects higher capital from retained earnings, partially offset by the larger end-of-quarter balance sheet.","Lastly, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our general outlook. We expect the net interest margin to be fairly stable over the remainder of 2012, with the caveat that new inflows of temporary trust deposits could diminish the reported margin but not the net interest income.","The September year-to-date net interest margin of 3.73% is the same as we reported for the full year of 2011. We continue to believe the figure for the full year of 2012 will be comparable. That said, we continue to expect in and around 2 basis points of underlying core margin compression as we move forward. We'd expect to offer our outlook on the margin for 2013 on the January earnings call.","Beyond mortgage banking, our lending pipeline remains healthy. That said, anecdotal evidence from customers is indicating that there may be some softening of demand as they await clarity regarding the election, as well as tax and fiscal policy. And it's difficult to offer an outlook on mortgage banking with any certainty. With rates where they are, we believe there will continue to be fairly healthy demand for refinancings for the next quarter or 2.","As I noted earlier, we've begun selling the bulk of our conforming mortgage loan production again rather than to retain them for investment, which should support mortgage banking revenues in the fourth quarter.","We were pleased to see further improvement of our efficiency ratio, part of which was due to strong revenues. We have achieved the bulk of our expected expense savings from the Wilmington Trust merger, with the possibility for some additional lingering benefits over the near-term.","Our outlook for credit is unchanged. We expect continued improvement in nonaccrual and criticized loan portfolios, with charge-offs remaining relatively stable.","Lastly, we continue to move forward with the Hudson City acquisition. The regulatory applications have been filed with the Fed and the New York State Banking regulators. And you probably saw the draft of our S-4 registration statement and merger proxy were filed on Monday. We continue to expect the closing of the merger in the second quarter. That said, we're still very early in the process and we will keep you informed as we progress.","Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","I appreciate your patience this morning. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which, Lynn will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I apologize, Ren\u00e9, if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but could you give us a sense if in that mortgage banking number, if there were any unusually large MSR hedge gains?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. No, no, because we don't hedge our MSRs actually.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it's 100% production, I guess, is the best way to think about it. And in terms of the -- you mentioned that the origination level doubled in the resi mortgage. That had nothing to do with you choosing to sell off more of your production because you mentioned that, that happened late in September. That was all just volume?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. So let me kind of give you those numbers again, and I'll give you some clarity there. So we did -- we locked $856 million in the second quarter, and it was $1.8 billion in the third quarter. Of that, there was about $500 million of that increase came from our decision right around the beginning of September to lock those for sale instead of our portfolio. So you'd still have a pretty big gain, but there's about $500 million worth of mortgages that we've kind of flipped and are planning to sell. So that gave you a bit of a boost. So when you look at the $37 million increase on a linked-quarter basis, I would guess that, my rough estimate is that $15 million sort of came from that -- $15 million of the $37 million came from that decision. And we still had -- I think we still locked maybe $350 million in the quarter for our portfolio, which, next quarter, we would not do.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And with regard to the cash balance levels, is this a more normal rate of cash balances for you going forward? Meaning, we don't expect any fluctuations higher even if those trust deposits are coming in, in the fourth quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. Actually, you don't -- it's -- you can expect continued fluctuation because of the nature of the business, which really came to us with Wilmington Trust. And the swings can be fairly large, but the earnings rate on those amounts are pretty low. So if I were -- my personal model, I tend to take a look at those and put a very, very, very low earnings rate on them because they move the printed margin but they really don't do much to the net interest income. So if you missed that, it can be a little confusing sometimes. But that'll continue to fluctuate. It's very hard to predict because as we get business related to our trustee work around securitizations and those types of things, oftentimes, we get paid in balances as opposed to fees. And that trend is relatively high, I guess, based on -- relative to past experience, so...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a follow-up on Erika's question about mortgage banking. So you said you all locked $1.8 billion in the third quarter and that without the portfolio activity, it could have been $350 million more. Based on your pipelines headed into the fourth quarter, is your expectation that you could do over $2 billion of volume? Or is there any shift in pipelines that gives you a different sense?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, we have what we call our mortgage pipeline, which is all the applications that we receive during the quarter minus anything that's been withdrawn or anything that's actually already closed, and that's still on an uptick. So in the first quarter, it was $1.4 billion; in the second quarter, it was $1.8 billion; and at the end of the third quarter, it was $1.3 billion -- sorry, $2.3 billion. So it still has a bit of an upward trend associated with it.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So it looks like you'll be doing more volume and selling even more of that volume in the last quarter. And is your expectation that margins will be relatively consistent third quarter to fourth, or any view there?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think when you normalize for the amount, like it took a while for the HARP programs to kind of catch up and normalize at their levels so you saw margins rising, but I think that's probably right that until that program dissipates over time, I think you'll see the margins just kind of remain where they were, I would guess. So I don't think the fourth quarter's really all that hard to predict. I think the bigger question is, how long does this last? And then we're kind of thinking about it as, at the end of the day, it allows us to build our capital. But we're not thinking that this trend can continue forever.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the resi loan front, I guess I was a little surprised by the amount of growth. I thought you all had scaled back the portfolio and activity earlier in the quarter than it sounds like you did. But given that you have made those changes in September, would your expectation be that from this level, that both securities and resi mortgages, that you don't see a lot of growth in either of those portfolios?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Again, the accounting has some effects that can get you a little confused, right? So the $1.1 billion that you saw this quarter was all -- were loans that we locked in the second quarter. So that means that the amounts, the $350 million or so that we originated for our portfolio in the third quarter still has yet to roll on and that will come in the fourth quarter. So you should still see some growth, nothing like the same size that you saw this quarter, but it takes about, in a normal time, it's about 45 days to go from lock to close. And with the pipeline so full, we've expanded our capacity sort of as much as we can, but that 45 days might be a little longer. Maybe it's 60 days, right? So I think you'll see it continue to rise a little bit in the fourth quarter and then, I would guess, it should level off. Okay?","Donald J. MacLeod","Making that offer is, even on a normal basis, there's a certain amount of nonconforming that we originate and contain, prime jumbos, bi-weeklies and that sort of thing. And that's, typically, a couple hundred million a quarter.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Which sort of serves to sustain the portfolio. It maybe compensates for normal runoff.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the last question, I'll hop out here. You mentioned that the Wilmington cost saves are largely in the numbers at this point or there could be some lingering near-term benefits, I think you said. Could you just talk a little bit about what some of those opportunities might be or how material they could be?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Think about it this way, we just -- last quarter, I guess, just completed our integration. So some of the remaining impacts of that, you're yet to sort of see. So I think near term, I wouldn't be surprised to see expenses controlled, maybe even slightly down. But then longer term, even though there will still be some benefit that lingers into the next year, as we begin to think about 2013, one of the things that we're thinking about is sort of our investments, our investments in technology. Obviously, our investments in the network associated with the pending deal with Hudson. So my sense is, is that I feel pretty good about '13, meaning that some of that lingering benefit will help us to pay for investment. It means our expenses will likely be relatively controlled in 2013, but not necessarily down, right? So we're beginning to think about it. I'll talk more about it in January, but that's sort of kind of my thinking today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Ren\u00e9, if you can talk a little bit about that preparation for ACBK [ph] a little bit more. And as that balance sheet comes on, you gave us some color when the deal was announced about the expected, kind of longer-term shrinkage of that portfolio. I guess any updated thoughts with regards to how the M&T balance sheet will change in advance of closing and then any differences in terms of how you're seeing the runoff or anticipating the runoff of the Hudson City book to be either better or worse, especially given what we've seen in rates recently?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. In short, as of now it's really early, but there's no change in what we're thinking about. And as we begin to kind of go through our normal M&T stuff, I think as you look out, some of the questions are difficult to answer about the size of the balance sheet. But I think the thing to think about is we tend to focus less on balances and more on profitability. So for example, we get questions about will you continue the jumbo program, and the answer is yes. Would we do it differently? I don't know. I mean it really depends on the profitability. We're going to focus on using equity in the best way. So I think it's hard to kind of comment on size, but I think we're probably same places we were when we did the announcement just a month or so ago. In terms of preparation on the people side, I think everybody's had their introductions to date. We've already begun our process of looking at the M&T folks who might want to spend some time in New Jersey and we've been out there recruiting. So it's nice to have a little lead time in anticipation of the sort of big distance between now and our anticipated second quarter close. So everything is going well, it's just not a lot of new stuff to really talk about. And of course, as time passes, that'll change, obviously.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Okay. My second question, Ren\u00e9, just about the trust income of business. I know, again, this gets asked every quarter about the different machinations on how the business works from a revenue perspective, but there were some benefits last quarter as well. Can you just talk about just some of the subcomponents within trust income, how they acted this quarter? And are you anticipating growth from here?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I would say -- I mean, let's do it this way. Let's -- let me just give you an advertisement first. So I'm really kind of pleased, a bit relieved in the sense that a year has gone by and we were able to get through what arguably is a pretty complex integration, merging mutual funds, getting people introduced to each other, and then getting the 2 sales forces to work together. And when you look year-over-year, we had 2% growth in trust fees. So we got the institutions combined by the third quarter of last year, we've now had 2% growth. What we've seen on the wealth side of the equation is that the couple years leading up to, and then last year, we had probably about as much new -- about as much runoff in business as we had new business. In the first 9 months of this year, that's crossed over, and we've had more new business and -- than we've had runoff. And quite frankly, the runoff has slowed from what Wilmington experienced the last couple of years. The stories are very good, meaning that we have a number of cases where we had pre-existing M&T clients that were more interested in doing business with us, both on the wealth side, or that felt that they were more inclined to do business with us simply because we had that wealth capability. But there's work to do. It's a little clunky internally and we've got our reporting and our process to get going, and I think that's probably understandable given that whether you're directly involved in the integration or not, some way, shape or form, whether you're explaining the integration to your customers or being directly involved, everybody's a little bit distracted over the course of the year to try to make all that work. So I think we're off to a good start. The growth -- my anecdotal estimate is that more of the growth that we got came from the CCS business, which has been, as I've mentioned several times, relatively diverse. And so that has been still robust and strong, and I'd say more of the growth, the 2% growth, is probably coming from that side of the shop. But that's what we know, more to come.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And last quick thing is just the losses in OCI and the losses in equity in Bayview, any better sight just given where we've come in the environment and spreads and credit improvement on when we might start to see those 2 areas finally start to tail off?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Sure, sure, Ken. So a couple things. I think if I go to our core non-agency portfolio, that's about $500 million now, it's down to about $500 million, we saw early stage delinquencies on that portfolio come down in August. And so that tends to bode well for what we might see in our securities book, in our private-label mortgage-backed securities book, we'll have to see. Despite the stabling of housing prices over the last quarter or so, we've always kind of maintained a down assumption and are kind of as we look out today, we're thinking that maybe over the next year, there's a slight upward trajectory in housing prices. And that's part of the reason why you've seen the change in the size of that OTTI. So I think it depends heavily on housing prices, and it depends if we were to get a lag effect, which was a positive effect on consumers and consumer delinquencies, then that would bode pretty well for that securities book. If it were to go the other way, it would change, but slightly more positive there. And then no big change in Bayview other than the same underlying -- any underlying credit costs seem to be very stabilized. And on the asset management front, they seem to have more opportunities than not because they've been producing very strong returns. Obviously, absolute returns, but also relative to what you can get out there in the market today with low rates. So things seem to be good on those fronts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned that you're continuing to see opportunities in Upstate New York and referenced some growth rates that were above the growth rate of the overall company. How much longer do you think that benefit can continue to help you in terms of your C&I loan growth and customer retention?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, it's a good question. Well, I think the best way for me to do this is we've been talking about the growth for a number of quarters and the opportunities, and I think a lot of my comments have been much more about the opportunities and what we're seeing as we see customers join M&T. And now, what you've seen is you've actually seen those customers roll on and begin to get funded and so forth. So you kind of -- you're seeing the result of the work we've done over the course of the year now. I don't know. I mean I think, obviously, again, it can't last forever, but the trend is sort of at a high point today. We're still hearing very positive things particularly in our business banking area, also, you noted on the consumer side. So maybe a couple more quarters, I would hope.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up on the trust customer defection comment that you made earlier. Could you remind us what your expectations were for the trust customer defections when you went into the Wilmington Trust acquisition and sort of where they've ended up being?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I mean I don't think I can do that in terms of numbers, but I can tell you we were nervous because we never had done an acquisition or a merger where that type of business was engaged. And I'd say out of the gate, we were relatively pleased with the lack of any significant defection, big-name defection. But where we began to get an understanding was that as we looked back with the help of the Wilmington and their -- the Wilmington folks as to what happened when they went through their very difficult time on the commercial real estate side, their defections had jumped up, say 2 years ago, 2, 3 years ago, and then again, they were up again going into 2011. And the only thing that was different about 2011, particularly the second half, is that the M&T customers began to get engaged. So I don't think there was much of a -- we didn't see any increase in trends of runoff from when we joined versus before. But I would guess anecdotally, we would've anticipated that there would be some. My sense is I'd have been happy if we were only down a bit in trust income year-over-year, right? If you think about in terms of trying to protect that revenue base and that customer base, yes, we were up. So that's the best I can do for you.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then just finally, your commercial loan yields were pretty stable, actually up a basis point quarter-over-quarter. How much pressure are you seeing in the structure on the C&I lending? We've heard anecdotally from a number -- from several other banks that their -- that customers are now looking to extend the maturities on their commercial lending. And I guess I'm just curious as to how you feel about that and if you've seen any pressure in that regard.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No big thing. In some cases, yesterday, I got an e-mail about something in Upstate New York where that was exactly the case, somewhat aggressive pricing and looking to extend maturities. But that is sort of the first I had heard about it from others. I know down in Maryland where our loan growth has been a little bit slower, particularly on the commercial real estate side, the life companies have sort of come back into play, along with the conduits actually slowly coming back into play as an alternative. And that puts a little bit of pressure on pricing and therefore, for us, volume. And then Pennsylvania, anecdotally, it's just that slow, steady improvement in the economy. And from time to time, you hear a lot about the smaller institutions being aggressive. This quarter, I really didn't give a lot of commentary about that. So when I look at our book, I have got a -- we've got a very robust thing here that we can see all of the amounts that we originated and what the margins are. Our margins have been up slightly each quarter, very slightly, and returns have held out pretty well. So overall, while I would expect the competition to be very aggressive, it hasn't been too bad relative to what we've seen in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, just quickly, one of the things we don't talk about too often is the purchase accounting and the effect on spread and margin. Obviously, there's been a couple of companies this quarter that have taken a pretty big hit with some of their underlying assumptions there. Just kind of remind us or kind of speak to how we should think about that on a go-forward basis. Just obviously, there's some timing differences relative to when you got Wilmington and so forth, but just kind of think of how you guys are thinking about that or how we should think about that kind of going forward, if whether you've made any changes recently or what the outlook is there.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No. So remember, so for us, we've treated the acquired loans, non-impaired and purchase impaired the same way. So today, I think you saw in our MD&A, we put a table in there which showed that the difference between -- on the acquired portfolio, the difference between what the customers' code M&T and what the carrying balance was is about $506 million. Versus the old days, it's funny accounting because the $506 million is basically not on your balance sheet, right? So when we look at this quarter, there's been no real change, I mean minimal, if any. I think last quarter, we had $90 million of benefit to total market from acquired loans, and that didn't change much at all. But as we kind of go forward, the way the accounting works now is that in essence, improvement in credit, to some extent, could come in and support your margin in the future if rates were to remain low, prices for -- or particularly with Wilmington, prices for land and commercial real estate, the construction projects were to sort of revive itself, you wouldn't see that come back and through the credit; you'd see it come through the margin. So what we do is we just look every quarter, we look at the entire book. We run -- look at the cash flow estimates that we have over the life of those loans. We run some screens to see if things are improving or getting worse or what it is. And then from time to time, meaning quarterly, if we were to think things are getting better with those cash flows or being able to collect some of that $506 million, which I think is about $470-million-something this quarter, you'd see that benefit into the margin. But there's no way to really kind of predict it, right? Because as of today, we think what we're basically saying is that we don't think the $477 million or $470 million is collectible. That's how it works.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. Yes. And then just as a follow-up to that, have you -- in terms of your initial assumption, in terms of the estimated life of those loans, has that changed at all? When you made ...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We don't change it from when we originally do the mark, but obviously, time is going by, right? So on that Provident transaction, it was in '09. So those portfolios are getting smaller. But we've not made any change in life estimates on the book.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just switching gears, just quickly on the reserve and credit, obviously, credit quality is pretty exceptional at the company. Historically, you guys have been pretty conservative as it relates to both your reserve coverage, as well as very modest reserve releases. How should we kind of think about that at this point given where credit quality is and going into the Hudson City, we're going to have a pretty significant mixed shift, and again, you kind of start at square one with the purchase accounting, and then you've got the repopulation effect. I'm just wondering basically how low could this -- could your coverage go effectively?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I love that question. I don't have a clue to the answer, especially when it comes to Hudson City. But let me start by -- look, our allowance ratio is coming down. I think that's a sign that our charge-offs have been improving at 1.44%. For the first time in a long time, our allowance ratio is actually the same, 1.44%, as our non-performing ratio, right? So it's 1:1. I think that my personal view is that more so than any big change in the inherent loss at our portfolio is the effect that delinquencies overall in the United States on real estate and delinquencies specifically on residential mortgages are really, really high. Still, if you go back -- we did a chart the other day that went back to the first quarter of 1985, they were very high. Why you're seeing improvement is because of the underlying rate environment, which is really being stimulated by the Fed and the policies. So we believe there really hasn't been a big change in the inherent risk in the portfolios, but there's been this sort of environmental factor with rates that's actually helped us be able to sort of move some of our non-performing loans and for some of the performance on real estate to actually improve a bit. So we still see -- we remain cautious as we kind of look at the underlying portfolio, but obviously, things are pretty stable. When it comes to Hudson City, the accounting rules are still relatively new, so we're going through to make sure we understand exactly how we'll treat those loans. These loans, loans at a discount versus a premium, may be different. So we're working through that, and it's hard for me to tell you right now what we'll do, but obviously, we'll try to be as clear as we possibly can regarding what we do there. But it's a little early for us to kind of give you clarity on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, can you tell us the loans, the mortgages that you put into the residential mortgage portfolio, what type of resi mortgages are those? Are they the 15- and 30-year fixed? Or are they adjustable?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","This -- there was a mix of 15, 20 and 30. I don't know if I have the history of what we put on. We were, starting last quarter, we started moving. And so what you saw come on this quarter, we started moving much closer to the 15-year space, and we were going to -- our anticipation was to keep moving more and more in that direction. But then of course, we stopped on September 1 simply because we were about to inherit a lot more mortgages from Hudson City. Don, do you know the fixed, the variable split of what we put on, for example, this quarter? I don't -- Gerard, I'll have to get back to you on that. But I think it's mostly fixed because at the end of the day, we were trying to close down our -- some of our -- or slow down our asset sensitivity. So we didn't have a big demand for variable rate mortgages.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. The other question, and you guys obviously do a very good job on managing your expenses as it showed this quarter, and I'm curious, you had such a great quarter in the mortgage revenue area, mortgage reduction. How do you compensate your originators? Because if it was a big variable comp, I would've thought you would -- I think salaries and compensation went down in the quarter. How do you guys compensate those folks?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It's industry-standard. I mean, well, it hasn't changed over time. They get a percentage on based on what they originate, and they do much better in environments like this than they do when things are -- when rates are going up. But I think what you're seeing is, I'll be just very frank, I mean our expense savings underlying for the core bank and for Wilmington and the combined bank has been very, very strong. So you did see we do have higher mortgage banking expenses in that number. Those costs are mostly variable. One thing that offsets it in the salary line is that your capital -- you're using SAS 91 to capitalize your salary costs, right? So the more that you originate, the more of your salaries that you defer over towards the life of the loan. So that's another thing that sort of dampens the effect there. But cash expenses are higher.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then could you also give us a little further color on the auto? You guys have been doing the business for quite some time and you already identified that the returns really aren't as good as you'd like in that business, which is affecting the balances of consumer loans. Are you seeing underwriting standards that really are starting to make you nervous, or is it just purely rate? You just don't like the rates?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, I guess I'll answer it this way, we could get a lot more volume at acceptable returns if we took a lot more risk. But is that -- I don't know if there's been a change in the industry. I would guess not. I would guess that most people are -- most of our competitors or people offering this service in the banking industry are focused on the same group of very highly creditworthy customers. That doesn't bode well for everybody in the U.S. to sort of share in the benefit of low rates. But having said that, that's what probably puts most of the pressure on us, is that we're kind of -- we remain in a relatively high quality space there. But I don't think there's been any real structural change other than rate.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And do your guys who are on the front lines come back and tell you folks that, boy, we're seeing more competitors now in this space of PNC or a Huntington, names that may have not have been as competitive 5 years ago or 4 years ago?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think that's just generally true, more or less, Gerard, it's kind of funny. Our guys have been around here a long time. And so it tends to be stories about how, well, these guys are back in again, and so-and-so left again, right? I mean because one of the strengths of M&T in this business is that whether things are good or things are bad, we've never left, right? So we maintain our focus. And I think at times when people have started to get out of the business, that's when we've been able to take share and we've done very well in the business. Right now, it's just the sort of the opposite side of the cycle. Gerard, just back to your other question, if we did $800 million of locks, $700 million were fixed.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And finally, and this might be more of a Board of Directors question, but in your history in the last 20 or so years, 30 years, you split the stock a couple of times. We've all seen the studies done by folks that look at stock splits and dividend increases generally being positive for stock prices over a long period of time. Is that -- would that come up in discussion, do you think, at the board level if the stock breaks through $100 a share and moves possibly higher?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","My guess would be, I doubt it. I mean, we're-- I'm not a board member, but we tend to focus heavily on economics. And unless someone could show us some value that's created for each of our shareholders in the form of cash, I doubt that we'd focus on those types of things. We have so much on our plate to do that I think those issues probably will go way to the back burner. But I thank you for that question because it's a long -- the first time we've gotten that question in a very, very long time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So most of my questions have been answered, but just, I know you mentioned that it's hard for you to sort of predict growth and overall size of balance sheet post Hudson City, but I guess, and maybe this is just a question for you to remind us what your strategy was, how you guys laid it out when you announced the deal. But so if I look back and you guys generally have managed or maintained between securities and residential mortgages as a percent of running assets, that 23% or 25% range, and then obviously, post Hudson City, that shoots up to 40%. And I know you're thinking about profitability and thinking about the jumbo business, but just knowing all that you know now, knowing the way you guys have run the bank for the last 20 years, where do you think you could manage that level down to?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","A couple of things. Let's just start with where we are today. So I don't know that anything has really changed in our appetite for discretionary assets. So if I look internally through the first 9 months at our plans, we are about $1.7 billion over in residential mortgages than what we thought when we built our plan. We're $1.7 billion under in securities, right? So we kind of look at those fungibles. So I would always look at the existing book right now as the difference between the -- I'd add resis and securities. And you'd see that some of that change is just muted because of substitution. Then as we go forward, we did say we'd open up with the balance sheet, I think, at $27 billion of resi mortgages. And that, over the course, maybe 18 months later, that would be somewhere tapered down into the low 20s. I think our -- remember, at the time you're getting familiar with an institution, what you're trying to do there is manage mostly risk, right? And then you've got to kind of get in and get comfortable with it. There's a portion of that business that I would guess also will serve to be -- to flip over to originate and sell like we do today. But there's also a couple of new -- or a couple of products that are probably -- that are new to M&T but that are very, very appropriate for that footprint around the jumbo mortgages, right? And our intention is to continue those businesses and to spend our time trying to understand the profitability, and the profitability of those will dictate the size. So I don't take away my comments that we'll-- 18 months after the acquisition, we'll have some $20 billion and more in resi mortgages. I don't know that I would treat all those as discretionary assets. We'll have to kind of think about how that mix breaks out, right? But that's how we think about it. And if it changes, we'll tell you, but we're learning.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And just what was the amortization speed of your own residential mortgage portfolio this quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It's been rising and it kind of moved up pretty quickly, past 15%. I don't remember exactly what the number was, but it was -- it moved past 15% this quarter, I believe. So maybe in the high teens.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's way -- I mean, because I think Hudson City's was running at like 27 or something. So it's...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I think it was 22, 20, yes.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're lower than Hudson, okay, okay. And then just on the -- and I think I can probably infer from your comment, but when you were talking about Wilmington Trust and trust revenues up 2% year-over-year and kind of giving your ad or whatever you said it was, did that 2% that you guys posted, is that better than what you expected, in line with what you expected or a little bit light, having gone in when you first went into the budgetary process?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","My guess is it was better than I expected, less than the Wilmington Trust team expected. I mean they were pretty optimistic, they're still very optimistic, and doing deals, you know that things don't always go really smoothly. Things have just gone better than average, so it's better than I expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, just wanted your perspective on 2 kind of separate issues. One is we've been hearing there's more regulatory scrutiny around bank reserve levels, and I saw your reserve went up a little bit and that makes sense because you had good loan growth, but any thoughts there? And the second piece was the CFPB is considering giving mortgage lenders protection from legal risk. I'm wondering if you see any impact there. The industry getting maybe more aggressive in extending credit at that point or maybe any specific points for M&T there?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No real outlook on the CFPB. But on the allowance front, look, I think we've all learned a lot from the last crisis. I think on hindsight, many reserves were just too low. And I think that the trend is that there's more emphasis on the banks to be very, very focused on identifying the underlying inherent risk in their portfolio. I think the stress testing actually probably adds to that, right? People are expecting us to really understand and think about the risk, where it could be lying within our portfolio. The one big trend though is just more and more documentation for whatever your position is. We're seeing that from every front, whether it be the audit industry or various regulators that come to see us. So that's what we're doing, and we're trying to make sure that we explain what we see and be very, very clear on it. I know there has been a lot of chatter, but I -- at the end of the day, you got to stick to your process and make sure you've explained it well.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Donald J.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the M&T Bank's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I\u2019d like to thank, everyone, for participating in M&T's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast.","If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.","As I noted in the press release, our earnings quality remained strong in the recent quarter, including higher net interest income, comparatively strong mortgage banking revenues and above average credit quality. We took advantage of favorable market conditions by executing prudent balance sheet actions that enhanced our liquidity, capital and long-term return profile, while continuing to serve the needs of our communities in a relatively competitive landscape and an evolving regulatory environment.","Let's review the detail of the quarter's results. After which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions.","Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per share, common share were $2.55 in the second quarter of 2013, up 29% from $1.98 in this year's first quarter and up 49% from $1.71 in last year's second quarter.","Net income for the recent quarter was $348 million, up from $274 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $233 million in the second quarter of 2012.","During the quarter, we took advantage of some -- of the stronger risk appetite from investors in the current low interest rate environment by selling over $1 billion of private label mortgage-backed securities previously held in our available-for-sale investment portfolio. The after-tax loss on the sale amounted to $28 million or $0.22 per common share. This transaction resulted in higher liquidity and capital and removed a risk-sensitive asset, which had been generating substantially all of our other-than-temporary impairment charges, from our balance sheet, and assists us in preparation for entering the 2014 CCAR process.","Also during the quarter, we sold our holdings of Visa and MasterCard common stock, which we had received through the restructuring of those companies back before the financial crisis. The after-tax gain amounted to $62 million or $0.48 per common share.","Lastly, following the second anniversary of the Wilmington Trust merger, we reversed an accrual for a contingent compensation obligation assumed in that transaction. The result is a reduction of noninterest expense, having an after-tax impact of $15 million or $0.12 per common share. Taken together, these 3 items contributed $50 million to net income for the quarter or $0.38 per common share.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions.","Included in GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were after-tax, merger-related expenses related to Hudson City that were incurred early in the quarter and which amounted to $5 million or $0.04 per common share. This compares with $3 million or $0.02 per share in the prior quarter. After-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets was $8 million or $0.06 per common share, unchanged from the prior quarter.","Net operating income for the quarter, which excludes those merger-related expenses and intangible amortization, was $361 million compared with $285 million in the linked quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.65 for the recent quarter, up 29% from $2.06 in the linked quarter. Net operating income, expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity, was 1.81% and 22.72% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.48% and 18.71% in the first quarter of 2013.","In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning press release -- this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Tax equivalent net interest income was $684 million for the second quarter of 2013, up from $663 million in the linked quarter. As required by GAAP, we regularly revisit the cash flow projections on which we base our valuations of acquired loans. In general, continued improvement in economic conditions, particularly in the former Wilmington Trust footprint, led to a reduction in estimated expected credit losses on acquired loans of $130 million. As a result, our estimates of cash flows to be generated by the acquired loans have increased by about 2%. Those increases resulted in about $6 million of additional interest income in the second quarter on our $4.9 billion portfolio of acquired loans as compared to the first quarter.","Of course, as acquired loans repay, and that portfolio reduces in size in future periods, the dollar amount of interest income earned on acquired loans will also decline. Net interest margin was 3.71% during the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.","A higher level of accretable yield from acquired loans added about 6 basis points to the margin compared to the first quarter. Prepayment penalties from commercial loans, combined with cash basis interest received on nonaccrual loans, added about 7 basis points to the margin as compared with the prior quarter, and higher level of excess funds held at the fed reduced the margin by about 9 basis points. This reflected a higher level of deposits by Wilmington Trust -- held by Wilmington Trust customers in connection with the pending -- in connection with pending capital markets transactions, as well as proceeds from the private-label MBS and the Visa and MasterCard stock that we sold.","Lastly, in line with our prior outlook, there were some 4 basis points of what we'd consider core margin compression, which reflects the continuation of the trends that we, in the industry, have been seeing, higher-yielding loans maturing and being replaced at today's lower yields.","As for the balance sheet, the average loans grew at an annualized 1% from the first quarter. Compared with 2013's first quarter, changes in average balance -- in average loans by category were as follows: Commercial and industrial loans grew a healthy 9% annualized; commercial real estate loans grew an annualized 2%; residential real estate loans declined an annualized 12%, reflecting in part our conversion of $288 million of FHA loans into Ginnie Mae securities, the majority of which were retained in our investment portfolio; consumer loans were down an annualized 2%.","On an end-of-period basis, both commercial and industrial loans, as well as CRE loans, grew at a similar pace to what we experienced on an average basis for the quarter.","From a regional perspective, the Upstate and Western New York region, as well as Pennsylvania, experienced decent overall loan growth at 8% and 7% annualized, respectively. This included double-digit annualized growth in C&I loans. While the benefit we've been seeing as a result of the HSBC divestitures locally is tailing off, I would tell you that there is still some lingering benefit, as customers who had not moved to M&T in the initial period following the merger are now finding M&T to be a good fit.","Loans in our metro region, which includes New York City, were relatively unchanged, reflecting paydowns on several large CRE transactions that generated the prepayment penalties I referenced earlier. The Mid-Atlantic region was also flat, I think largely in connection with the fact that it's the region that we're seeing the most competition from banks, as well as from life insurance companies.","Average core deposits, which excluded deposits received at M&T's Cayman Island office and CDs greater than $2,000 -- $250,000, grew an annualized 12%, reflecting in part the trust-related deposits I mentioned earlier.","Turning to net interest -- noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $509 million in the second quarter compared to $433 million in the prior quarter. Included in that figure is a $56 million of net securities gains, which includes losses on the sale of the private-label MBS and the gains from the sale of Visa and MasterCard stock that I previously noted. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains and losses, was $452 million, improved from $443 million in the linked quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues declined to $91 million in the recent quarter compared with $93 million in the prior quarter. Residential origination volumes declined by 2% from the first quarter, while residential gain on sale margins declined by 40 basis points. The bright spot was on the commercial side, where originations and gain on sale revenue nearly doubled from the first quarter, which masked the decline on the residential side. We'll update you on our outlook for mortgage banking revenues in a few moments.","Fee income from deposit services provided were $112 million during the recent quarter compared with $111 million in the linked quarter. Trust and investment revenues were $125 million, up from $102 million in the prior -- excuse me, $125 million, up from $122 million in the prior quarter. Those revenues benefited from the normal seasonal uptick in tax preparation fees.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $578 million for the second quarter. Excluding the reversal of the accrual that I mentioned at the beginning of the call, operating expenses were $604 million. This compares to $618 million in the first quarter. The decline compared to the linked quarter reflects a return to normal levels of compensation expense, following the seasonally high levels in the first quarter, partially offset by higher professional service fees, including those related to our BSA\/AML work.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization and the merger-related gains and expenses, was 50.9% for the second quarter, improved from 55.9% in the prior quarter. Excluding the reversal of the Wilmington Trust accrual, the efficiency ratio would have been 53.2% in the second quarter. That efficiency ratio was also improved from 56.9% in the year-ago quarter.","Next let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remained strong and in line with our expectations. Nonaccrual loans were 1.46% of loans at the end of the second quarter, improved from 1.6% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter and 1.52% of total loans at the end of last year. Other nonperforming assets, consisting of assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans, also continued to decline, down from $96 million at the end of the first quarter to $82 million as of June 30. As has been the case for some time, we expect to report a further decline in our level of criticized assets when we file our 10-Q next month.","Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $57 million compared with $37 million in the first quarter. The increase was the result of a $30 million charge-off on a loan to a wholesaler and remanufacturer of auto parts. The annualized charge-off rate -- the annualized net charge-offs, as a percentage of total loans, were 35 basis points, in line with our long-term average. Annualized net charge-offs were 23 basis points in the linked quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $57 million for the second quarter, exactly matching charge-offs. As a result, the allowance for credit losses was unchanged at $922 million at the end of the second quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41%, again, unchanged from the linked quarter.","The allowance -- the loan-loss allowance as of June 30 was 4.9x the annualized net charge-offs for the annualized year-to-date net charge-off level.","Loans 90 days past due, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition, were $340 million at end of the recent quarter. Of these, $315 million or 93% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Loans 90 days past due were $331 million at the end of the first quarter, of which 94% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","M&T's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 8.55% at the end of June, up 62 basis points from 9 -- from 7.93% at end of the first quarter.","With the adoption of the final rule on Basel III capital accord for U.S. bank holding companies, we are now working on formalizing our disclosure for this ratio and should begin ongoing reporting of this measure by the end of the third quarter. Our preliminary estimate is that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III will be 40 to 45 basis points lower than that under Basel I. This contrasts with our remarks on the January call, where we estimated that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III -- under the Basel III NPR will be lower by some 75 to 100 basis points than under Basel I. So another way, we estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III at the end of June would be approximately 8.1%.","Lastly, let's turn to our outlook. The rising long-term interest rates during the quarter from historical low levels provide us with an opportunity to invest in higher-yielding, qualifying, liquid securities, and we continue to see the potential for the estimated 3 basis points of quarterly core margin pressure that we've previously indicated. The intense competition among lenders and other -- in our markets continues. Although at this point, our outlook for mid-single-digit loan growth for 2013 is unchanged. The tapering off in Residential Mortgage Banking activity that we referenced earlier this year has obviously begun and should lead to further declines in mortgage banking revenues and gain on sale margins during the second half of the year.","Turning to expenses. While we expect our core expenses to continue to be well managed, we expect our professional service expenses to continue to rise, reflecting our continued investment in infrastructure, including risk management, as well as enhancements to our capital planning and stress testing. In addition, we are hiring staff to support those and other regulatory efforts.","And with respect to credit. Despite the charge-off on the loan to the auto parts company this quarter, we expect net charge-offs to remain low for the remainder of 2013, which, as I've noted before, are already below what we consider to be our long-run -- long-term loss rate.","As I've mentioned previously, we remain focused on enhancing our capital and liquidity profile and closing the gap with our peer regional banks as we transition towards becoming a CCAR bank in 2014. We continue to build a quality capital at a healthy pace, with our estimated Tier 1 common ratio at 8.55%, again, up 140 basis points from last June and 62 basis points from March.","Lastly, I want to end by giving you an update on the BSA\/AML matter that we disclosed in April. As you know, we subsequently entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve on June 18, which outlined our obligations to address the fed's concerns regarding BSA\/AML compliance. The written agreement calls for submitting a plan in the near term, which would then need to be carried out to the satisfaction of our board and the fed. The satisfactory execution of that plan is a critical path towards a resolution of that written agreement. We are working diligently to address these matters in a timely and accurate manner. The successful resolution of which will result in a stronger risk management infrastructure at M&T for years to come.","Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth: changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may materially -- which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","I know you all have been busy this morning with all of the earnings announcements in addition to ours. So now maybe we'll -- let's open up the call to questions. Before which, I'll have Jackie briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just want to make sure I get all the moving pieces here. So within the release, you guys talked about a $13 million impact to net interest income, which sounded to me maybe related to the $130 million you re-classed from the non-accretable. So that to me, I think is -- how does that kind of reconcile with the $6 million you talked about here this morning?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. You've got to think about -- we -- when we report, in our Q, the table on accretable yield, it's all of the yield on the acquired loans. So you have that number coming down from quarter-to-quarter, right? We added a new estimate of our cash flows that we're likely to receive. So really, when you look at the change from the quarter-to-quarter, that accretable yields from acquired loans, that actually increased by just $6 million, right, because the number is coming down over time.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got you. So the $70.5 million you recorded in the first quarter, that number had gone down by $7 million, and now you added $6 million in. So...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So I think that number is about $6.5 million higher than the last quarter, $70.5 million to $77 million or so.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I got you. Okay. And then -- so I guess going forward then, that $6 million -- I mean, I guess, if I had a run rate, that I was kind of assuming you'd have a level yield in that acquired portfolio that the accretable yield would go down, I should be adding somewhere about that $13 million impact to my -- what I would have guessed would have been your normal accretable yield going forward? Is that fair to say?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I think if you were to reset yourself, right, you can kind of look back at those tables we provided. You can see how much that is coming down. So for -- I won't give you the example, but you can kind of work your way through that. But the way I think about it, Brian, is we're left with about $4.9 million of acquired loans out of, say, 60 -- sorry, 6 -- $4.9 billion of acquired loans out of $60 billion. And if you look at the yield, the yield -- the difference between our yield on loans with versus without those acquired loans is about 15 basis points. And if you assume for a minute that the average life is 3 years, you're going to lose about 5 basis points of that every year, basis point or so a quarter. That's embedded in when Don and I talk about 3 basis points of compression. That's one of the things causing that compression. So your assumption of level yield is that's the way we look at it. That's the appropriate way to look at it, I think.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So x all of this, your guidance then of saying, \"Look, you should be back to sort of the 3 to 4 basis points of core compression.\" That is assuming though that you take, what, about $2 billion or so -- $2.4 billion of interest-bearing deposits, that excess liquidity, which was the 9 basis point drag this quarter on the NIM. You are going to put that back to work, either you're going to buy some securities or actually put that in organic loan growth?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Well, I mean, how do I -- good question. So what I would say is you got it right. So we're -- our thought process is 3 basis points of compression a quarter. We're still sticking with that. One of the things that we do have is we do have the opportunity to reinvest that cash in sort of qualifying liquid securities, as you start thinking about the new ratios that are coming out. So that gives us some ability to offset. And I don't know how to exactly think about that because as you know, we often think about match funded. So as we put on Ginnie Maes and those types of things, economically, we think about the spread towards wholesale funding that we could go out and get. But you're right, one of the sources that could in the near term have the margin be more stable is reinvesting those -- that cash.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I'm going to get in the queue. But just with that, you haven't reinvested that excess liquidity yet?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We've invested some. So if you look at the investment securities portfolio, you've got -- so we sold the $1.1 billion of the agencies. That probably had an average impact of somewhere between $600 million and $700 million on the balance sheet. But we also purchased a little over $800 million of Ginnies. And if you think about what we've been saying, our investment securities book has been shrinking, in part because, and this is my term, the rate seemed to be a little artificial. And so with a jump-up of 100 basis points, it was sort of a nice opportunity for us to say, \"Okay. Well, let's start buying some, so that we can hold those qualifying securities as we go forward.\"","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, that agencies you bought, can you just give us that yield, and I'll -- then I'll get back in the queue.","Donald J. MacLeod","The Ginnies we bought -- we committed to buy in 2Q, but they all settle in July. So they're not on the balance sheet at June 30.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Ren\u00e9, couple of questions just in terms of the BSA issue, as well as Hudson City. First off, can you give us a sense of like the time line for the planned submission to the fed?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I mean, the only thing we really can give you is as you saw in the written agreement, there's a requirement, around 60 days, for us to come up with our credible plan that would need to be approved by the regulators. And then what's probably most important is from their reaction, we have to go execute that plan, right? So the way I think about it is we're really focused on submitting that plan, and then we'll have our head down for some time, trying to make sure that we have everything in place to execute it. So I think sort of speculating on any time line, at least right now, doesn't make much sense for us. We'll keep updating you as we move forward. But there's not really much to say beyond that at this point.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is only just my assumption that you guys, obviously, had kind of started that work prior to formerly receiving the agreement based on what they had possibly communicated to you previously, as you guys disclosed that last quarter.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I mean, that's true. I mean, I'll say 2 things: I feel that I'm happy, we got a good jumpstart on the issue. And in the same tone, I think we've got a lot of work to do. So I think the way we think about it is once you get into something like that, like everything else, you want to build a first-rate process, not one that just sort of meets the hurdle, but that you can sort of use as an investment for the long term. So I feel good, and at the same time, I also feel like we've got a lot of work to do.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, understood. And then I don't know if you can answer this. But within the agreement, there's not necessarily any prohibition in terms of asset purchases and so on and so forth. But I think as you mentioned in your remarks, you want the plan and execution, so to speak, to be to the satisfaction of not only the fed, but the board as well. So help me kind of understand in terms of, again, kind of that process, if you will, from a formal standpoint and how it may affect or influence your ongoing kind of evaluation of the Hudson City transaction as I think about valuation in your ongoing review of that deal as time goes on.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, you got a couple of questions in there. I think -- I mean, I think one, I'm going to repeat myself. I think once we get through the work we have to do on BSA\/AML, and when we get through to the satisfaction of everybody, then we'll consider what we do with things such as Hudson City, but really not before then. In terms of the economics, I mean, we have a good understanding of Hudson City's balance sheet. We think about, for example, what the moves in rates will do to them. We -- there's a lot of moving parts, but there's nothing that makes us uncomfortable about the economics of the transaction relative to where we were before. Obviously, all of that's got to be revisited when we sort of get back at it, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the servicing acquisition that you guys are going to close, when is it going to close and how we think about the financial impact of it?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, again, I think the first thing is, is that we're not purchasing servicing, right? We -- what we've agreed to do, that's been out there in the [indiscernible] public for some time is to be a sub-servicer, right? And so just sort of operationally, I mean, if you think about expenses for a minute, you're likely to see expenses rise on a normal basis. I talked about that earlier on my earlier comments. But we've now hired about 500 people located here in Buffalo that used to work for a third party. And all of those 500 people are up and running as of July 1, right? So first thing you're going to see is that there'll be a little bit higher expenses as you get into the third quarter, and then that work will trickle in through the quarter, right? And so I don't think you really get a full running impact of any change in our servicing profitability in probably till the fourth quarter, right? But I would say, it's kind of relatively negligible if you think of the bottom line because of the fact that you've got to sort of start up -- negligible next quarter because you've got to put those upfront costs in place.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was getting more at what you think the incremental kicker is from a run rate perspective, not from a next quarter. But is this accretive to earnings? Is it -- I mean, the math would say it is. I'm just trying to give -- get a sense of if this -- is this a needle mover, is this just...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I mean, it's a great question, Ken. I guess, the way -- I didn't think about it till you just said that. But I don't really -- it's not that big, such that it's going -- I mean, going to offset the decline that we're going to see in residential mortgage gains, and we saw a 40-point decline on the residential side there. I wouldn't be surprised to see the same again next quarter. I don't -- I think that's probably the bigger theme, maybe mortgage banking revenue will be a little bit supported over the next few quarters by it, but you're still going to see an overall downward trend.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And Ren\u00e9, just the -- that reversal of the Wilmington gain, did -- could you just talk to us about the size of that and where that was geographically within the expense lines?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, it's in other expense. And this was when we closed the merger at the outset of the opening balance sheet, there was contingency outstanding, obviously, because if you can take yourself back to all that turmoil, we wanted to make sure that we were properly reserved given all of the contracts that were sort of out there. And I think what you see is this very nice sign that as -- over time, we've kind of gotten through the integration. It's now a little past the 2-year anniversary. A lot of people have remained with M&T and have decided to sort of remain as part of the group. So what you're kind of seeing is the finality of all that. And there was sort of that amount that was no longer considered a contingent liability as we got to this quarter. So I think I said the amount, did I not?","Donald J. MacLeod","On a pretax basis, it was $26 million.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","$26 million. Okay. And then last quick thing is just can you give us the mortgage apps pipeline closings?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, yes. So I'll give you a couple numbers. So this lock volume, I'll give you, the first quarter was $1.8 billion -- $1.9 billion. Second quarter was $1.8 billion. And then if I give you the pipeline, at the end of the first quarter, we have $1.6 billion. And the end of the second quarter, we have $1.6 billion. So what's happening is the volume is up, is remaining steady, maybe down 1 or 2 percentage points. But the only reason that's happening is because the gain on sale margins are dropping at a healthy pace. So I think that kind of tees you up. I wouldn't expect a big, big change in volume next quarter, but I would expect gain on sale margins to continue to decline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how the movement that we've seen in mortgage rates and interest rates generally impacts the Hudson City acquisition. And I think that those assets get mark to market at close. So with mortgage rates higher, how does that affect, I guess, the capital gain, as well as the income off of that business?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay. So I'm going to give you this very -- in a very general sense and from my understanding of, over the past year, the balance sheet, not necessarily from having any conversations with Hudson City. And I would guess, if I look at the profile of that balance sheet, the mortgages will extend some, net interest income will be higher. The issue you had is the steepening of the curve. So obviously, that's going to affect a little bit of the mark on any sort of fixed rate asset side, but you're going to have them out there for a longer period as well, right, so that's a little bit of an offset. And I wouldn't expect much in the way of any change in the mark on the liability side, right, because the short end didn't move. So you could get some -- if you're thinking of March, maybe there would be some negative impact as where we stand today. Really what matters most is what happens to the short end because that's where the big issue is on the wholesale borrowing. The second point I would make is that as we see things here, these are reflections of the economy improving. So you also should get some improvement on the credit profile. I mean, they're pristine. But having said that, everybody should get some benefit from the improvement in the economy. And the third thing is that the change in the Basel III rule is probably a positive effect from what we are all thinking on how mortgages are treated, both from the complexity of what we have to do to track it all and also from the favorable capital treatment from the rule now being finalized. So there's a lot of moving parts, right, but those are the items.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question, and I'll hop back out. The bump in CRE loan yields this quarter -- I know you mentioned prepayment penalty income. I'm just curious how much of that was the prepayment? How much was maybe the adjustment in assumptions on the Wilmington purchase loans? And I didn't catch the prepayment dollar amount if you gave it earlier.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. I lumped it all together, and I think with the nonperformings, and we said that was 7 basis points, the 2 in total relative to the previous quarter. And I mean, without getting real -- I have it somewhere, probably half of that is probably prepayment. Give me a second. Yes, I don't have the 2 broken out, but let's say it's half of the 7 basis points, just as a general thought. I think the real issue, it's interesting, is that -- so when we sit around thinking about that we say, \"Okay, well maybe that won't reoccur next quarter.\" So we tend to be relatively conservative. But having said that, it's very logical that we were seeing prepayment -- those prepayment penalties, because all throughout our balance sheet, we saw the impact of lower rates and people trying to refinance. We saw it in credit, in both deals, in our normal portfolio, where it actually was not a bad quarter in terms of loan volume in terms of origination. But we're seeing a lot of refinancings. We're seeing that in the nonperforming book. It's also part of what's behind the reversal on the Wilmington side of the -- into accretable yield, right? Because people are able to refinance things that are relatively healthy. So that said, it's hard to predict. It's somewhat lumpy in the margin, but it could continue, for while -- as people are trying to make sure they lock down their refinancings with the anticipation of rates being up.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And the Wilmington credit market investment, was that predominantly in the commercial real estate portfolio? Is that where virtually all that was?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It's across the board. There was a fair amount, a healthy amount in the real estate portfolio, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on the liquidity. What -- of the $2.4 billion in average balances, especially in light of the Basel III requirements on liquidity, what -- how much should we consider excess to -- for reinvestment?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","So let me just -- I'll get to you -- I'll do it in 2 parts. So overall, our focus over the next couple of quarters is to sort of -- is to continue to improve our liquidity profile, and sort of the movement in rates makes that a little bit easier today. So as we get to the outset, would not be surprising to see all of that sort of reinvested in very, very liquid-type securities. But beyond that, we probably would continue to focus on that through additional -- we did $800 million of unsecured funding a quarter or 2 ago. We'll probably do more of that, right? So over time, we'll start to work on that liquidity profile as we get closer to the final rules. And then that will have to be also invested. So I'd kind of think of the first set as maybe all of the $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion will be invested. And then there'll be more, but it will -- those will be at sort of match-funded spreads, right?","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a second question on the follow-up to your expense guidance. Should we think of the base upon which we're growing expenses for the second half of the year as $604 million?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I don't see anything wrong with doing that. I think yes, then you'll have to make adjustments for -- again, I mentioned the people we've hired and we continue to hire folks on the regulatory side. I think since last quarter, for example, we've hired 53 BSA\/AML professionals, we've added to the team. And then you'll see professional services rising some as well, but starting at that $604 million is probably a good way to go about it.","Operator","Your next question comes your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at overall loan growth here. I understand why you're reducing the consumer real estate portfolio at a pretty fast clip here. But I'm wondering, can you provide some commentary around your expectations for overall loan growth before the Hudson City deal closes, really given kind of modest negative loan growth in the first quarter and flattish loan growth during the second quarter.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","What was the first part? Modest negative growth when?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was just saying -- well, I mean, the question is what are your expeditions for overall loan growth given residential real estate is kind of running off and commercial is actually fairly strong.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. So I don't know if you caught that, but we securitized some FHA loans. And so a little under $300 million of that just went right into our securities book. So in terms of earnings assets, there wasn't much of a change. There'll be a slight runoff in the resi portfolio, but we'll also do some -- retain a certain portion to sort of keep that runoff to be flat as we go forward. The C&I, I mean, it was a little higher than normal, and I would say 9% growth is pretty healthy. We haven't seen a change. When we look at our pipeline for both C&I and CRE, the quarter was pretty good. The amount of pressure on deals that we accepted was light. The margins were strong. The thing that we're seeing is that there's a fair amount of prepays, particularly on the fixed rate portfolios. And then finally, if you look at the consumer side on as that [ph] basis, and particularly if you look at home equity and indirect, for the first time, they actually had slight growth. So it sort of seems like those are leveling off, which is kind of why we held our -- held on to our 5% number overall. So we don't see much change. Some people are talking about slowdown. But everything we see is -- the slowdown is driven by paydowns, which is always good from a credit perspective, it's always good from the customer locking in lower rates and being healthier, right? So that's our logic behind sort of sticking with 5%, or mid-single digit, I think is what we -- or low mid-single-digit loan growth.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And Ren\u00e9, you classified about $10.4 billion of consumer real estate loans in the June quarter. I understand why that was down, but do you expect that portfolio to decline at a pretty quick pace the next few quarters? Or you think that should kind of level off here?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It hasn't changed much. I mean, it's been down 1%, 2% every time we report. And on an asset basis, it was actually flat to up this quarter, right? So I kind of view it as slowing. I can't think of another reason why that would change.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Ren\u00e9, just a number question on the fee waiver. What was the impact of fee waivers in the second and first quarter in the trust income line? Was it material?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Fee waivers.","Donald J. MacLeod","On the money funds, I think I'll have to get back to you on that, Craig. I don't have that in hand right now.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, finally to your last question, I think the other thing is, is that we may do more securitizations, right? So that will be just to re-class. But again, we want to make sure that the portions of our balance sheet that we have as customer loans, that we make sure that they have guarantees and a certain amount of liquidity as we kind of think about our liquidity coverage.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ren\u00e9, at the beginning of the call, you mentioned that you -- part of the reason why you sold the securities was to help your 2014 CCAR application. Is -- has anything changed in terms of the application process? Are you -- is there a certain reason for why you're doing it? Because obviously, you went through the process last year. I was just wondering what's different about next year's process.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's a great question. It's a great, great question. Well, we went through the CapPR process, which is a process where we run our own models and we go through a review, and the Federal Reserve and other -- Federal Reserve actually goes through and reviews our governance and our process. But we've actually never been a CCAR bank, which requires an extra step, which is being part of the horizontal process, in which half is -- half of that process is what we did before, but the other half is that it now goes through the fed's own models, right, which was something that we're not familiar with. So we've really taken the position that as we kind of have learned about our portfolio, we thought -- we want to make sure that we're pretty well positioned to go through that test for the first time. And of course, that sort of is all benchmarked off of where you are at 9 30. So it's been a big focus of ours. Well that married up very nicely, with the private label mortgage-backed securities is that we run a model and we've modeled those for valuation purposes. And until recently, our model was saying that those securities were worth more than what the market prices were implying. But as we got into the early part of the quarter, that changed, and the valuations on the market were well above our model. And so we decided to pull the trigger. To give you some sense, had we pulled that trigger back in '09, the difference would have been roughly $240 million, right? So it's not a core security. It's also a risk-sensitive security. So if you have stress and housing prices were to drop, right, then not only are you not going to collect that $200 million extra, you're going to take a hit, right, in OTTI under extreme stress. So it's not a core asset. We decided to move it off, and then we take the $1 billion, and we also use it to improve our liquidity profile.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. That helps. And then just really quickly, or last thing is on the CRE payouts you mentioned, there was a couple of big ones in the quarter that drove the prepays. Was that -- how large were they? I'm just trying to get a sense of if it was meaningful for the growth in CRE this quarter.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. It would have changed the percentage growth. I definitely think so. I don't know how to -- I mean, first of all, there were several. Several loans, anywhere from $5 million to $30 million, $35 million would not be abnormal. And not only that, in our nonaccrual book, you had several loans that paid off as well, right, so both there and the nonaccrual balances. So how do I say it? I think -- I kind of think of it as more of a trend. I don't know how long the trend will last. But I don't know if that helps. There was not one really large transaction that paid down [ph].","Operator","And that was our final question.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald MacLeod","Thank you, Laurie, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I'd like to thank you all for participating on M&T's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relation link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to SEC filings including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As noted in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the first quarter reflected strong growth in net interest income, which was driven by an expansion of the net interest margin and solid loan growth, controlled operating expenses stable credit performance. All of these contributed to an 11% growth in diluted net operating earnings per share over last year's first quarter.","As noted on the January call, we closed the merger with Hudson City and restructured its balance sheet in last year's fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we completed the migration of Hudson City's customers to M&T's products and services, as well as the conversion of its branches, systems and operations onto M&T's platform.","Hudson City's risk management framework has been fully integrated into M&T's risk governance structure, and our task now is to continue the evolution of Hudson City from what was essentially a monoline thrift into a real commercial bank, which will of course take some time.","Overall, we feel the first quarter was a productive one. As we usually do, I'll start by reviewing a few of the highlights from M&T's first quarter results, after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions.","Turning to the results, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.73 for the first quarter of 2016, improved from $1.65 in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the quarter was $299 million, up 10% from $271 million in the linked quarter, and up 24% from $242 million in the year-ago quarter.","Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses associated with mergers and acquisition. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.05 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $4 million or $0.03 per share in last year's first quarter and $6 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter.","Also included in the first quarter results were $23 million of pre-tax merger-related charges in the form of non-interest expense, incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $14 million after-tax or $0.09 per common share. Merger-related charges in the fourth quarter included $76 million of non-interest expense, and $21 million of loan loss provision. Combined, those amounted to $61 million after-tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the first quarter of 2015.","M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $320 million compared with $246 million in last year's first quarter and $338 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.87 for the recent quarter, up 11% from $1.68 in the year-ago quarter. That figure was $2.09 in last year's fourth quarter.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.09% and 11.62% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.21% and 13.26% in the fourth quarter 2015. And in accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement; taxable equivalent net interest income was $878 million for the first quarter of 2016, improved by $65 million or approximately 8% from the linked quarter. About $45 million or some 70% of that increase reflects the full quarter of Hudson City's results compared with two months in last year's fourth quarter.","Contributing to the growth in net interest income was a six basis point expansion of the net interest margin to 3.18%, up from 312 basis points in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of that increase was the full quarter effect from the Fed's mid-December action to increase short-term interest rates, while the benefit from the day count in the shorter quarter was largely offset by the dilutive impact from a higher level of deposits placed at the Fed.","Average loans increased by 8% or $6.5 billion compared to the linked quarter. This included a 27% or $5.5 billion increase in residential mortgage loans, which primarily reflects the impact from the full quarter of Hudson City results.","Looking at the other loan categories, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $497 million or an annualized 10%. Commercial real estate loans increased $452 million or about 6% annualized. Consumer loans grew at an annualized 1%, with growth in indirect auto loans offset by a decline in other consumer loan categories.","The loan growth was broad-based, excluding the impact from Hudson City mortgage loans, we saw a 6% annualized growth in upstate New York, 5% annualized growth in our Metro region, which includes New York City and New Jersey, 9% annualized growth in Pennsylvania, and 4% annualized growth in Baltimore, Washington, Delaware region. I'd note that end-of-period loans grew by 2% annualized with a 15% annualized decline in residential mortgages more than offset by 9% annualized growth in other loan categories.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received in M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 increased by an annualized 32% from the fourth quarter, also reflecting the impact from Hudson City.","Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income totaled $421 million in the first quarter compared with $448 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage Banking revenues were $82 million in the first quarter compared with $88 million in the prior quarter, largely the result of a $5 million decline in Commercial Mortgage Banking revenues to about $22 million, down from $27 million in what was a solid fourth quarter.","Similarly, credit-related fees were lower by $14 million, coming off what was also a very strong fourth quarter. That decline is largely related to fees that are often event-driven, such as a syndication fee and can vary somewhat from quarter-to-quarter. Several fee categories were impacted by the typical seasonal factors that we see. For example, fee income from deposit service charges provided was $102 million during the first quarter compared with $106 million in the linked quarter, and trust income was also down modestly.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the first quarter which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets were $741 million compared with $701 million in the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased that we've kept expenses relatively stable, while absorbing Hudson City, as well as funding our technology and other initiatives.","This is reflected in our efficiency ratio, which was 57.0% for the first quarter, improved by 450 basis points from 61.5% in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that approximately 280 basis points of that improvement is attributable to the merger, and 170 basis points is from M&T's legacy operation, the result of our ability to grow revenues at a faster pace than expenses following several years of strengthening our infrastructure. The efficiency ratio was 55.5% in last year's fourth quarter.","As usual, the first quarter comparison with the fourth quarter reflects our normal seasonal increase in salaries and benefits relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, the 401(k) match and the annual reset in Social Security or FICA payments, and similar items. Those items accounted for an approximate $40 million increase in salaries and benefits from the fourth quarter, similar to last year. As usual, those seasonal factors will decline by some $30 million to $35 million as we enter the second quarter.","One item worth noting is the increase in FDIC assessment to $25 million in the first quarter from $20 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects in part the fact that one component of the FDIC's assessment calculator looks back at Hudson City's earnings and treats them as if the Hudson City merger had been in place for the entire year, instead of just the final two months of 2015, and notwithstanding the fact that Hudson City paid its own FDIC assessment as an independent company through the first three quarters of 2015. This factor will normalize as we move later into the year.","Also, as you know, the FDIC has imposed a surcharge on large banks to recapitalize the deposit insurance fund more quickly, likely starting in the third quarter. We estimate that this will add about $5 million per quarter to our assessment expense, starting in the third quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to say strong, with continued low levels of non-accrual loans and net charge-offs. Non-accrual loans increased to $877 million and the ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans was 1% at the end of the recent quarter.","The $77 million increase from the end of the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to Hudson City mortgages. As you know, loans obtained from Hudson City that were 90 days past due as of the acquisition date, were recorded as purchased impaired loans. And in accordance with GAAP interest continues to accrue on those loans despite their delinquency status.","Appropriately, those specific acquired loans were not in the non-accrual balances as of either March 31, 2016, or December 31, 2015. The higher level of non-accrual loans at the end of the first quarter reflects the normal migration of approximately $80 million of previously performing loans that became more than 90 days past due during the recent quarter. And which could not be deemed as impaired at the acquisition date, because they were paying at the time of the merger.","As a result, we should continue to see a migration of the Hudson City loans acquired at a premium into and eventually out of non-accrual status as this process normalizes to a more steady state through the passage of time.","Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $42 million compared with $36 million in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, M&T charged off loans associated with consumers who were either deceased or filed for bankruptcy. That, in accordance with GAAP had previously had been considered when determining the level of allowance for credit loss. Such charge-offs totaled $14 million in the recent quarter, and included $11 million of loan balances with a current payment status.","Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the first quarter, up slightly from 18 basis points in the previous quarter, and matching the figure we reported for each of the past two calendar years.","The provision for credit losses was $49 million for the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $7 million. And the allowance for credit losses was $963 million amounting to 1.10% of total loans at the end of March.","Loans 90 days past due, which continue to accrue interest, excluding the acquired loans that have been marked at fair value at the acquisition were $336 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans $279 million or 83% are guaranteed by government-related entity.","Turning to capital, M&T's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.06%, little change from 11.08% at the end of 2015. Recall that the capital plan M&T submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, and which received no objection from the Federal Reserve, included the repurchase of $200 million of common stock over the first half of 2016.","We began execution of that buyback program in January and expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter. In addition, because the completion of the Hudson City merger occurred later than contemplated in the capital plan submission, we did not pay all of the projected dividends associated with the M&T common stock that was issued as merger consideration. As disclosed previously, the distribution of that capital, some $54 million, is being redirected into the repurchase program for the second quarter of 2016.","Now, turning to the outlook, as is our usual practice without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full-year that we gave to you on the January call.","Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with or slightly better than our expectations with solid growth in commercial loans in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate loan. We were pleased with the strong performance of our net interest margin. Our outlook on the January call for stable net interest margin was predicated on two increases in the Fed's funds target in the calendar year 2016.","More recently, the forward curve is implying one increase in mid-year, which would still be a benefit. To some extent, the margin is dampened by our decision to maintain pricing on Hudson City's time deposits, which we will revisit over time. Fee revenues are in line with our expectations given the normal seasonal effects that we talked about. As is normally the case, we would expect the seasonal increase in salaries and benefits during the first quarter to reverse itself again to the tune of some $30 million to $35 million in the second quarter, and we remain on track with realizing our expected cost savings from the merger.","Overall, our basic outlook for expenses is unchanged; we remain focused on producing modest positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short-term, while we've had little or no impact from the energy-related credit headwinds that others are seeing; the current low level of losses has persisted for over two years.","Overall, our areas of focus for 2016 are fairly straightforward and relatively consistent with what we've talked about in the past, to continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet with an emphasis on building out our commercial banking profile in New Jersey; to manage the revenue expense dynamic to produce positive operating leverage; to capitalize on the M&A-driven disruptions within our footprint; and to optimize our capital structure while conforming with both regulatory capital threshold, as well as the annual stress test.","Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth; changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","So now, let's open up the call to questions before, which Laurie, will briefly review the instructions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Donald MacLeod","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning, Don and Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good morning.","Brian Klock","So Ren\u00e9, with the loan growth, end-of-period loan growth was very strong in the C&I book. So interesting, it seems like the Gary Keith survey that he did in February seem to be directionally down sort of like the NFIB survey that came out a week ago, that seem to be more negative. But it seem like the loan growth, may be later in the quarter, picked up on the C&I side, so maybe, can you talk about what you guys saw, and was it in certain regions that you saw stronger C&I growth than others?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Not really, and I think, Brian, I try to give those total loan growth numbers which were driven mostly by, obviously commercial. And it was pretty strong across the board, maybe slightly more leaning towards commercial real estate in Western New York, but other than that, C&I growth was strong across the board.","I think, the thing that impressed me most was, we get our results, and we look at them, but then in preparing for the call, we tend to look at the quality. So what is the quality of the loans book? What's the pricing? And we were able to get the growth without seeing any deterioration in the margins and the total returns that we were getting on that population of loans.","And one of the other things that I think was interesting is that, in some of our markets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Upstate New York, and to some extent in Washington, D.C. and New York City, we saw, the margins actually on \u2013 new deals come up maybe, 20 basis points to 25 basis points, which we, I guess, estimate that, that had to do with the widening spreads that we saw in the capital markets, and the slowdown in the CMBS market, it had some small effect. So I was very encouraged by what we saw, I thought the pace was pretty even, and I think our pipelines continue to remain fairly robust.","Brian Klock","Okay. So again, so the outlook is for overall loan growth to still be muted by the rising mortgage run-off coming out of Hudson, but do you think the C&I in commercial real estate would be as strong as it was in the first quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Let's say this \u2013 we're going to stick with our outlook for January. We're really pleased with this quarter. It may get a little lumpy here and there, but I don't see anything that suggests that, things feel a little better than they did for the whole of last year when we started out.","Brian Klock","Okay. And then one last question, can you breakout \u2013 out of the residential mortgage decline, linked quarter, how much of that was Hudson City versus core M&T?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","There wouldn't be any of the decline. Remember, almost all of the decline, Brian, is on the commercial side, so \u2013 and that's coming off a pretty strong first quarter. We had about a 10% increase in our quarter-end pipeline for residential mortgages, so we started off slow. We kind of made up for it, and as we went into April here, the volume still remains pretty decent.","And then Hudson City, I don't have the exact numbers, but we did begin \u2013 we do have production, the first quarter of production that we would have seen in doing the normal agency stuff that we sell into the market.","Brian Klock","Okay. Thanks for your time, Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Good morning.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good morning.","Ken Zerbe","First question, just in terms of the Hudson City loans that went non-accrual, the $80 million, just so I have a sense of magnitude, is that a normal-sized quarter? Was it little heavier, little weaker? Just trying to get a sense of how much we should be expecting going forward?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I mean, it's a normal pace. So we were seeing probably, I mean, I'll just do this roughly, $25 million a month roll into the delinquency status. But had we not done the acquisition accounting, you would see a similar amount roll-out. So I'm sitting next to Mike Spychala, so he's always going to kick me when I say this, but as a rough proxy this quarter, if you go in the press release, and you look at page 11, you'll see there's a \u2013 we disclose purchased impaired loans. You'll see that those came down $80 million, right?","So those would be the ones that are still in accrual status, and so you'll get a normal migration in, and a normal migration out. So I think what that means is, as a percentage \u2013 non-performing as a percentage of that book, it will continue to rise, I would expect at about the same pace that it is \u2013 that you saw this quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. That helps. And then just with expenses, the $30 million, $35 million seasonal that comes out in second quarter, just want to make sure that we're using the right base. The $753 million that you reported this quarter, I know there's just a lot of moving parts with Hudson City, but is that the right base to use, so you're sort of in a $720 million range next quarter, or is there any other moving pieces?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I'm using, which you might not be able to see, but I'm using $741 million.","Ken Zerbe","Oh, ex-amortization?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, because remember, you've got, what you also have in the numbers, you have stuff like, you can't see the one-time expenses that are in the salaries, all right? So if you take out the merger-related expenses, and you take out the amount, you're at $741 million. And when I say, $30 million to $35 million, I mean off of that number.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. But off of that number, that is the right base to use?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the fee income side, again, around service charges. I know you gave us little bit of color around seasonality. I know on a year-over-year basis, service charges were flat. How should we think about what's going on there, and how to think about the growth as we model out?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I mean, I don't \u2013 I'll start by saying, I don't see anything unusual in those numbers. We know that commercial mortgage origination fee income tends to be lumpy. You saw that. We talked last quarter about the fact that the third and fourth quarters in commercial loan fees was very, very strong, so that bounced back down.","I would expect that to come back at some point, and continue to be a little bit lumpy. You just can't predict exactly how it's going to work. So there was nothing there that really concerned me. I didn't change my outlook or view of what's going to happen for the year based on what I saw this quarter.","John Pancari","Okay and you would say the same thing around the trust income? Obviously that was impacted by the market, etcetera, nothing really changing your view there?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, let me explain that a little bit. To me there's maybe three factors there. The market which you mentioned was probably a third of that, so $1 million. And then we do have income from affiliate managers, and we also offer collective funds to other relationships that we have. And essentially, you remember that both of those are down, a little seasonal, a little bit about the balance is just being lower because of market participation.","On the collective funds, you get almost an equal offset on the expenses, because, right, you're just passing that through, so that was probably a third. And then, I think the last piece is probably just a bit of seasonal stuff for tax reporting and those types of things, you see bounce back in the second quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then lastly, just wanted to get a little bit more color on the efficiency ratio? Kind of follow-up to Ken's question, but at the current level, what are your expectations for full year efficiency, how we should think about that? Thanks.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Okay. Well, I think, what I've been doing is, I just simply look at the first quarter results relative to last year's first quarter. And then I superimpose that performance over on the full year. And I think \u2013 as I said, obviously we got benefit from Hudson City, but we've got a substantial benefit right now from the core M&T operations.","And I think our job is to sort of maintain that, and again, we're just looking for, over a long period of time, some modest spread between the two. So I don't have a number on top of my head, but I think if you do that, you probably get somewhere around 54.5% or somewhere in 54% range, but you can do that.","John Pancari","Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey","Hey. Good morning. Hoping you could elaborate a little bit, I know you mentioned that you all are maintaining CD pricing on the Hudson City deposit base, and just kind of curious, sort of what the timeline looks for that? How you've, I guess what the interactions have been like with Hudson City customers so far? When you think you'll be able to start to migrate that deposit base?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, I think the first thing I would say, Bob, is that, we're sort of set up, right, because we spent the whole quarter getting ourselves on the same platforms and system. And we spent also the whole quarter with our folks from legacy M&T in the retail bank sitting side-by-side with the new Hudson City employees. And so, that training has been ongoing. And I think, we will need more time, some part of this year, to make sure that those balances stick around, and that we have the opportunity to interact with those customers over time.","One of the things that you're seeing is that, we're getting about \u2013 our pre-payment speeds on the mortgage book of 15%, so say $300 million a month. But we haven't really seen the similar run-off in the time deposit book, because we're maintaining those prices in an effort to reach out to contact those customers through the course of the year. When we talk about some diminishment of our margin, that's embedded in our margin at the top of the house.","So while we're calling for a stable margin for the full year, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of basis point decline next quarter, and you'll see, that will be solely the effect of maintaining those, that sort of higher time account balances, and pricing, but that's totally in our control.","So at some point, as we target the customers that we're very focused on getting, and that there's a very high probability that we can convert, the rest of the book will just revert that process to normal rational pricing that we want to do in New Jersey, and that should give us some benefit. But we're not in a rush. We've got the ability to introduce ourselves to those clients, so we're going to make sure we do that.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, that's helpful. And could you remind me when you talk about a stable margin for the year, are you sort of talking about stable at this 3.18% level or stable to the 3.14% for the full-year last year? Or was it somehow an adjusted number that included Hudson City?","Donald MacLeod","We were talking about stable to last year's 4Q, which was indicative of the post-merger, so 3.12%.","Bob Ramsey","So, 3.12% is still sort of full year, where you guys expect to shake out?","Donald MacLeod","Yeah.","Bob Ramsey","Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't think I expect significant change during the course of the year. And if we were to keep our position where we're offering the current rates in New Jersey and the Metro market, my sense is that that any Fed rate hike of 25 basis points more than offsets it, and we'll manage those two. So somewhere between what Don said, and where we were this quarter, it's probably the right answer, but it's stable is the way to think about it.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, great. And then last question and I'll hop out, but nice to see the uptick in loan yields. I know you mentioned that reflected the Fed increase. Just curious, if from where we sit today, is that fully factored in? Or is there any sort of lagged follow-on benefit that you should see in the second quarter from what the Fed has already done?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, I think it's fully factored in right now.","Bob Ramsey","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, David.","David Eads","Hi. Good morning. Maybe if we could \u2013 on the \u2013 you talked a little bit about the FDIC extent. Just want to kind of confirm, is it fair to think about you've got a little bit of improvement from the assessment based on in Hudson City, kind of rolling-off and then you guys step up in 3Q, so basically it's kind of flattish through the rest of the year? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, directionally that's right. We should see that increase we saw now roll-off by the end of the year, but then we're going to add five per quarter for the assessment. So a fair way to look at it.","David Eads","All right. And then it was helpful to talk about the 170 basis point of core efficiency improvement. Is that kind of in the fairway of when you talk about your kind of modest efficiency improvement? Or if you \u2013 or is that kind of on the upper end, where if you continued there, you might want to front-load some of the technology expenses, you feel like you'd have more ability to do that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, two things. Remember, what you're seeing in this quarter is the work from last year, and that has a lot to do with \u2013 we talked about a lot of professional services that were in place that came down over the course of the year. We've only begun to really ramp up our technology spend.","So to give you some sense, our technology spend this quarter was about $20 million higher than it was a year ago in the first quarter. And my sense is that, that will continue to ramp up to the third and fourth quarters before it hits the run rate level. And that's why when we get the additional savings from the Hudson City, that should dampen that somewhat, and so you won't really see a big change, is my guess, overall.","David Eads","Okay. That makes sense. And it is a good baseline to go from. All right, well, thanks for taking the question.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Hi, Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Matt.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Can you remind us the money market waivers within the trust fees, how much they were in the fourth quarter? I assume you got some improvement there this quarter. And then how much is left if short-term rates go up further?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, I think \u2013 I'm going to answer your first question in a minute, but I think, yeah, you're right. The full impact is in the quarter unless we were to see another rate increase. And I'm just not \u2013 I don't have the amount off the top of my head.","Donald MacLeod","We got back to the proverbial couple of million. The waivers we've previously disclosed would be just less that.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","$6 million to $12 million a year?","Donald MacLeod","No, it's more like $30-ish million.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I'm sorry.","Donald MacLeod","Run rate.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So $6 million in the quarter?","Donald MacLeod","I don't think we got that much.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Somewhere around there should be the full effect of a quarter. It'd be about, I think, it's about $6 million, but I'm just doing that off the top of my head.","Donald MacLeod","But just to expand on that a little bit, the guys are a little worried about our ability to fully recoup all the waivers given the fundamental changes that are happening in the money market industry. For example, the migration of settlement accounts from prime funds into government funds, and how will corporate customers take the redemption restrictions on prime funds and will they choose to go to other alternatives.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. Then I think, our view on that is that, we'd be more conservative, so less income in the near-term, but over time maybe more later, but not this year.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","And I guess, just more broadly speaking, I mean, I feel like there had been some changes in the trust business, maybe back-half of last year. I mean, how are you thinking about outside of market movement impacting that line? How are you thinking about the business, and is there expense rightsizing you need to do, maybe for example for things like not getting the money market fee waivers back over time or just kind of more broadly how do you think about the business?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, thanks for that, I'm glad you started that way, because we've spent, I don't know a good 18 months at essentially getting rid of parts of the business that we didn't really think we had a strategic focus on. And so, you saw that year-over-year with the retirement business \u2013 a portion of retirement business that we got rid of.","We've also gotten rid of a number of affiliated managers or those balances have run down. So I think, you're starting to get to sort of the core of what we would keep going forward. And underneath, things are going very, very well both in the Global Capital Markets portion of the Institutional Client Service business, and as well as in the Wealth side, and my sense is that, that still has an underlying growth of 4% or 5% in the revenue space, but more importantly it's a heavy-expense business.","And so, what we've been focused on, and I believe we're starting to make really good traction on is sort of streamlining the back office, which comes in a couple of forms, right, it's sort of \u2013 now that we've got all of our controls in place, we're beginning to change our statementing process, we're beginning to change our on-boarding process, which has an impact of freeing up expenses, but it also improves the service quality.","And so, I think we'll be at that for at least another year or so. And it should, from a bottom line perspective continue to grow. Bottom line, both of those businesses have grown every year since we brought them on board. So we're pretty pleased with where they're going.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Kind of just lastly, I'll stick on this topic here, I mean, holding the markets constant, do you think you can grow revenues in this segment? And then on the expense side, how much costs actually do come out as you streamline the back-office you were just talking about?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. No, I do think that \u2013 I'm absolutely positive that we can continue to grow revenues in this space. Remember, one of the things, I guess, I would share with you is, think about this, in many places, we're getting paid in balances, right? So be careful, just looking at that trust line, because in the Global Capital Markets business, we're making a choice, either as we sign up new business sometimes we're getting paid in fees, sometimes we're getting paid in balances.","And so, it's hard for you to see that total picture. And I would look, Matt, at \u2013 don't look for an expense number, because we're investing in that business. And so, I would say widening margins is really what we're focused on. And so, you might not see an expense decline somewhere in there, but you should expect to see the whole business grow in the margins, and the bottom line widen.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Okay. If I may make a suggestion, more detail on that business overall might be helpful. Because I just feel like it's been in a decline from a revenue point of view as you've been kind of changing the mix, and it may be helpful to show broader business, how it's performing longer-term, if you want to consider?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We'll think about it. Thank you.","Matthew O\u2019Connor","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Good morning, Ren\u00e9 and Don. I wanted to ask you one quick one, restructure charges, are we getting towards the end of that with integration of Hudson City or do we have a couple more quarters to go there?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think we're thinking maybe $10 million, maybe $14 million somewhere in there, more, most of which should be next quarter.","Marty Mosby","And then with the transition of Mortgage Banking from Hudson City coming on board, are you kind of seeing now, it's kind of shifting out in a sense of what's going to go on the balance sheet and portfolio, and what really is going to be securitized and just on origination capacity?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, I mean, the large majority of what we produce there, I think you'll get a better up and running view maybe next quarter and the quarter after what that volume looks like, but all of that is, the majority is going to be sold, and where it's not, and what it's done for our balance sheet, it will be specifically either retaining certain target customers that are with us already and balances, maybe because they happen to own a business or have a profile that we would like to see if we could bank them. But I think that will be harder to see as a segment. I would tend to focus on that government-related type business we're putting into the securitization market.","Marty Mosby","And then when you talked about the servicing income being down, was that the $5 million from the commercial side or was there any write-downs in servicing income related to the drop in long-term rates towards the end of the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No write-downs, and if I use the word servicing, I might have misspoke. It's commercial mortgage origination income that was \u2013 in fact that was down.","Marty Mosby","Yeah, that's what's you had highlighted, just in the press release there was something about servicing income, so that helps. Thanks.","Donald MacLeod","A little bit of the pressure on the commercial side was servicing, but more of it was lower origination.","Marty Mosby","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good morning.","Matthew Burnell","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just \u2013 Ren\u00e9, maybe a question for you related to deposit pricing, it looks like that was held pretty stable despite Fed's action in December. And you gave us some good information in terms of the loan growth by market. I guess, I'm curious if you're seeing any deposit pricing competition, and I guess, I'm specifically focusing on Upstate New York, given some of the upheaval in that market that's been announced over the last few months?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. No, not yet. Not seeing anything in any emerging yet. We're all seeing a little bit more on the advertising front, and those types of things, but nothing that really has affected our book at this point in time, but it's early.","Matthew Burnell","Okay, fair enough. And then just as a second question, you mentioned it would take a little bit of time to train the Hudson City team to be more of a true commercial bank; how long do you think that, that will take?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, look, the folks are fantastic, as are ours. And so, I think the pure training will be done over the course of this summer, I think we'll be well on our way. The thing that takes a long time is converting a thrift platform into a commercial bank, and quite frankly, it may be a better description that you actually are creating a commercial bank while you are rightsizing a thrift; that's probably a better way to think about it. We've done it before, we did it in Syracuse, it just takes time.","But on an incremental basis, I hear a lot of folks are writing about, well maybe M&T's balance sheet won't grow that fast, but the growth is never how we think about it. We think about transforming the quality of that book. And so, if we can make New Jersey look more like a full-service commercial bank with also retail capabilities, each year or so you will see a difference, and it will improve the overall profitability profile. So it just takes time.","Matthew Burnell","And then, just finally, Ren\u00e9, you've got a reserve to loans ratio at 110 basis points, it's obviously down year-over-year due to Hudson City. But you did build the reserve a little bit this quarter, I guess, I'm curious how you're thinking about that trend over the course of 2016?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Similar to what you saw from the fourth to the first. And then if I broaden your questions over time, I would expect that to migrate back up as, again, similarly, as we end up with a book that looks more like a commercial book, and not a residential mortgages which tend to have a fairly low loss rate, I would guess, that the history of the Hudson City charge-off, annualized charge-offs are less than 25 basis points, 15 basis points to 25 basis points, right? So that's what's dampening that. And as that book runs down, you will see the allowance to loan ratio move up.","Matthew Burnell","Okay. Thanks, Ren\u00e9, I appreciate your color.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Ren\u00e9, just on that last point, so now that we've gotten to see a full quarter of Hudson City, is there kind of, run-down in the mortgage book and that migration towards the faster commercial growth? Is this about the pace that we should kind of see that run-down and remix that looked like the mortgage was down $1 billion, sequentially?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, I think the short answer is, the random walk answer is, yes, all right. The longer answer as you think towards the end of the year is to think about what mix do we want to have of run-off in the mortgage book and the time book. And right now, they're mismatched, right. One is running-off, the assets are running-off at about $300 million a month, whereas the time is being held up, both of those might normalize a little bit so that they're moving in sync is the way to think about it. And that will help us with any pressure on the margin. And then we'll have to think about how long we deal with that, right because those two trades are very low-margin trades.","Ken Usdin","Yeah. And in that regard do you have an idea yet of how big you want the mortgage book to be as a percentage of either your loan book or your earning asset mix? I'm sure that's got a securities component to it as well, right, just from a total rate trade perspective?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So, in the near-term, all we're going to do, we'll sit around the table and we'll look at statistics. Are we able to convert folks? What's the offer that we have? Are they bringing over checking accounts, right? And we'll go through that whole thing.","But really if you think about it in a simple way, go way out, you've got 130 branches, you know deposits per branch that you think would be healthy in our markets in Upstate New York, $50 million would be big, and sometimes in a place like Jersey or New York, $100 million would be more like, in fact it sort of takes some average in there, you can actually see that you're building a $10 billion bank in that space, right, over a long period of time. And if we view it as looking like a typical M&T footprint, you kind of get there, but over a long period of time, right?","Ken Usdin","Right. Okay. And then last, just quick one, you mentioned that you're on track as far as the conversions. Do have a sense of when you'll get to kind of your run rate savings on that conversions front, what quarter we kind of get there in terms of the cost saves?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. So Hudson, right?","Ken Usdin","Yes.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","So this is the way we're thinking about it. So prior to our acquisition, their annualized expenses were about $280 million a year. We think, if we look at the first quarter, and you were to annualize those expenses, it would be about $230 million. So there's $50 million of savings that have taken place.","We think that, as we get to the end of the year, maybe that's $190 million, $200 million, all right; somewhere in that range. And then it stays there until we build the bank and grow the bank, all right. So it will take some time, but again, I don't know that you'll see those remaining things, because we expect an uptick to be offset by the things that we're trying to do on the technology side.","Ken Usdin","Right, the other investments. Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, Ren\u00e9. Can you give us some color on the automobile lending business, clearly you've been in the business for quite some time and we've been reading different stories about the subprime aspects of it, having some distress, particularly in the Southwest. How are you guys looking at the automobile lending business?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, we haven't changed much. Our volume that we've been doing in that business has been running, oh, I think, we're doing something like $130 million a month of volume. In the low point of that business when we were kind of shying away because there were uncertainties maybe five years ago, it would be something like $80 million or $90 million and then in the high point we maybe, we're doing $200 million when that business was really robust.","You keep in mind that we sort of stay in the prime space, all right. So for example, this quarter we averaged 729, our average score, which is pretty consistent, if you go back over four quarters or five quarter, it's all around 725 or so, is our average.","So with that said, we are seeing growth or opportunity because of this record year, but pricing is really, really competitive, and so that's what's kept us in that $130 million a month, because that's what's sort of hitting our standards. Within that, most of that volume we're trying to direct towards the dealers that we also supply them, we finance their floor plan loan. So it's trying to run it more and more like a relationship business.","The one thing that you're seeing, which we're in lockstep with, although in a better credit profile is that, delinquencies are moving, it's the one portfolio where you see an increase in delinquencies. And to give you some sense, these are rough numbers, but if we were at December of 2014, I think 30 days plus was 1.97%, and this quarter at the end of the quarter it was 2.32% or 2.36%, all right? So similar migration that we're seeing, and what I think is interesting about it is, you don't see it anywhere else in any other portfolio, which is the same nationally.","Gerard Cassidy","And what's your view on what's going on with the Dealer Reserves with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? Will you guys move to a flat fee as a few banks have done? Or what's your view on that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We'll watch. We'll watch what happens with the industry. I think from the intelligence that I have, people that have taken that move have seen an immediate decrease in business.","Gerard Cassidy","Correct.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","But having said that, a number of folks have told me that subsequently over time that's rebounded as the customer base gets used to it, and they get a slightly different makeup of the customer base, but a rebound. So, we'll watch that over time, but no decisions to change anything that we're doing right now.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then you touched on the integration of Hudson City obviously being a thrift, you've kind of experienced with doing these types of integrations. Was there any benefit from all the money you had spent over the years in upgrading your internal systems? Was this integration easier than what you've done in the past? Or did it go smoother because of the money you had spent?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, okay, so two things. I'll answer that two ways. The reason it went smoothly is because Hudson City was relatively uncomplicated. We had a lot of time to think about it, right, and a lot of time to watch the portfolio, so our team is \u2013 I shouldn't say it but I'll say it, our team is really good. They've done a really good job over the years at these integrations. And so the lack of complexity was what made this go so smoothly, I think.","Having said that, we did have a much more robust approach, sort of, beyond the due diligence to looking at the integration area by area and monitoring the potential areas for risk and closing them down. So for example, as we went into the conversion, specifically, focused on exactly 70 different places where risk could exist and where that risk would exist between the date we acquired it, the portfolio, and the date we integrated it. And then we were able to go through and close all of those down by the time we got to sitting here today.","So, I think one of the shifts is that because of the way the process works now, the idea of anybody doing simultaneous merger conversions is long gone. We are sad about that from the standpoint that it limits your risk, so you need a much more robust process now, if you're going to own the institution and not convert it right away. And that was something that we added this time, which I think went very, very smoothly.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then recognizing you have a dominant market share in Buffalo, can you give us any color on any customer migration that you're seeing from the transaction between First Niagara and Key?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It's early, but we have a lot of positive signals. As you know, we've been in the market for a long time. We live here. So our view is that we should see positive migration of customers. It'll just take a little bit of time to do that. And obviously, that transaction hasn't sort of been completed and there's no conversion going on now. But our sense is it's early but there's nothing in the indications that we see that don't suggest that we won't fare well in the disruption.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And finally, can you give us any update on your written agreement regarding BSA\/AML? When you might think that would be listed?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, I don't know. We haven't been focused on it. We've been focused on our work. And I think from a BSA\/AML perspective, we're really, really pleased, as I said last quarter, with everything that we've done. We think we've got a great process and we also think that we've got a much more broader and a more robust process overall beyond BSA\/AML. So we'll keep doing what we do and there's nothing in front of us. We're focused on Hudson City now and that'll just happen when it happens. But nothing to point to. Nothing good or bad. No news really there.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, Ren\u00e9. Good morning.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","I just actually had two follow-ups. In regards to Ken Usdin's earlier question on the resi mortgage run-off, was there anything unusual this quarter in terms of the $970 million period-end decline?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. I mean, that is like as steady as it goes.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I just wanted to follow up on the comments about the additional investment in technology. I would think the need to invest in the front office is fairly broad at this point, particularly as you convert Hudson City into a commercial bank. Is this a year that you guys really step up broad investment? Do you just basically manage that through the efficiency ratio, where you have opportunities, you'll reinvest? But can you talk about the front office investment need this year? Thanks.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Let me just ask a question first, when you say front office investment, do you mean people, or do you mean...","Steven Alexopoulos","Yeah. I would think if you're going to build out a commercial side of Hudson City, you need to bring bankers in over there, for example.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, and that has been happening, and it's all embedded into what we've got in our operating plans for this year. So that's incorporated in the numbers I'm talking about. It's another place where the \u2013 it's some \u2013 the Hudson City expense savings I'm talking about are net. And so we have made a lot of progress. We've had quite a few pick-up in hiring business and middle-market lenders. We've hired a few business bankers, and we have more to go through the course of the year.","I think one of the things that we're thinking about in terms of \u2013 we know that we're bringing on increased head count in those areas of discipline. And while we're recruiting from the outside, we're also very focused on the idea that if there's an M&T person that wants to be in New Jersey, that benefits us very well because they're bringing all of our experience there. So we're also looking at a \u2013 in addition to adding people, we're looking at migrating people there.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. So essentially what you're saying is the investment needed in Hudson City, we're seeing in the numbers today?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, you're seeing it in the numbers today.","Steven Alexopoulos","Yeah. Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","And I think we'll be in good stead by the end of the year to look \u2013 the staffing complement will be finished by the end of the year.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Okay. That's what I had. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley of Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Kelley","Yeah. Hi. Just staying on the Hudson City cost saves, I believe, when you announced the transaction, Hudson was running at about $222 million of operating expenses and 24% with the savings bogie, so $53 million in dollar terms. Maybe if you could just give us an update on how much of that has already been extracted relative to that number. And correct me if those were inaccurate numbers in the dollar terms of the cost saves.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't have that in front of me, but I think the difference between \u2013 look, logically the difference between our two numbers is maybe FDIC expense or something, but I was about $280 million is what we had all-in where they were running. No, I mean, I'm trying to think is there a specific area where it's greater? No. No, I think we were just able to realize a little bit more expense saves than we thought. So we're above the $53 million. I'm trying to think it's not in any one category.","Matthew Kelley","Got you. Okay. And then on the deposit costs, your average CD costs during the quarter was 75 basis points. There's a lot of institutions that are in need of funding in New Jersey, Metro New York City, high loan-to-deposit ratios. Where are you, right now, in terms of rollover rates for existing Hudson City customers on typical CD terms, one year to three years?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't want to quote the exact rate, but we're very competitive. We're up at the \u2013 up there, over 1%, I think, on some of those. And those are both in renewal and in looking at places where someone might bring on a checking account.","Donald MacLeod","I believe a lot of that book is in the under the year category as well. There's not a lot of longer-dated stuff there.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah.","Matthew Kelley","Got it. Got it. And then what should we be using for an effective tax rate going forward?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","This is a pretty good quarter, I think, Mike?","Michael Spychala","Yeah, I would say we're spot on in this quarter. It varies each quarter as the amount of pre-tax income changes. There's a lot of the permanent differences that are steady and it's up this quarter because there were [indiscernible].","Matthew Kelley","Okay. Just over 36%?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. Yeah. So this is a good quarter.","Matthew Kelley","Got it. And then just one last one, on your commercial real estate yield of 4.16%, up 5 basis points versus year-end, what categories are you seeing that the new production anywhere near those types of four-plus handles on commercial real estate yields? And maybe just talk about origination yields versus that number.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't think in terms of yields. I always think in terms \u2013 I see the yield increase you're talking about, but I think mostly in terms of spreads. And one of the things that you'll get is sometimes there's some lumpiness in the prepayment penalties would also go into that space. But while I think pricing was solid this quarter, it's not significant enough on new loans to be moving that yield.","Matthew Kelley","All right. Were prepaids particularly high this quarter?","Donald MacLeod","They were \u2013 they're not higher than last quarter.","Matthew Kelley","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jill Shea of Credit Suisse.","Jill Shea","Good morning. Just in terms of capital return, given your strong capital positioning, can you just talk about how do you think about total payout and your appetite for share buyback, realizing that out quarters are contingent on the CCAR results, but can you talk about how you think about total capital return and payout over time?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I think I talked a little bit about this maybe in January but we've been on an evolution. That evolution is, this will be our third CCAR and we were at a CapPR before that. In the last two CCARs, we were at about 9.10% in our Tier 1 common ratio and then maybe 9.70% and we fared pretty well. But at that time, we weren't thinking about distributing any capital because we were in a space where we still had a transaction to do. And so just out of that normal principle, we wouldn't be doing that because there's some risk when you enter a transaction, if maybe a recession happens, when you're doing it, or there are some operational issues.","So because that took so long, it allowed us to build up that capital over time. Also, think about the idea that when we first announced the deal, we had about $28 billion in mortgages and that's now down to $17 billion, right? So we have all the capital that we expected to have but the book has run down over that period of time, also as we expected. So, over time, we thought it, no, we've got to distribute that capital back to the shareholders or to put it to a decent use and that's sort of our task and what we're trying to do. We've today been lower than everybody in the total payout ratios, probably half of what the industry has been. And I think I've said our intention would be to normalize that.","And over long periods of time, because we run a model that's not based on growth but it's based on profitability, I think we will always be having a lot of excess capital relative to the average in the industry. And we'll try to do the right thing. We've got a good history so far. But I think one of the things that you won't see us doing is necessarily buying a bank just because we have excess capital. We think that might be the fastest way to destroy value depending on what the pricing is. We'll be cautious and try to get it back to you.","Jill Shea","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Sterne, Agee.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Peter.","Peter Winter","Quick question. Consumer loan growth, it moderated this quarter. I'm just wondering was that seasonality or was it something else that caused that?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Home equity loans, I think, were down and they're down and utilization has been low. I only imagine that that's sort of the natural offset with rates being low and mortgage volume picking up. But it's been pretty steady. You're talking about loan balances, right?","Peter Winter","Yes.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. That's what it was. It was the continued low utilization on home equity.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then I'm just wondering, do you have what the impact could be with regards to the trust, wealth management business with this fiduciary rule?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We're going through it. It's nice to have a little bit more time. We think on some level over a longer period of time it fits us very well because of who Wilmington Trust is. But at this point in time, I actually do not see any profitability impact. It's just how we migrate to the right space. And for us, I don't know that we're all that far from where we need to be in principle today. So my sense is we'll work our way through it, but I don't see any negatives and, quite frankly. Longer term, maybe there's a positive for us.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. Thank you for squeezing me in. You kind of piqued my interest when you mentioned that wider, high-yield spread and CMBS spreads were given you an opportunity to lend more during the first quarter, because, back on the last call, you talked about those as an early indicator that you look at on the credit front of things potentially deteriorating. So I guess, I'm curious do you think that this cycle is different? Or are they both an indicator and the reason that it makes sense to lend more?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I guess the way I see it is we've got a pretty granular discipline process. So if I provide more color, I would say the feedback I'm getting from the commercial bankers is that on larger or more complex transaction is where you were able to see slight move in pricing. I think that does tell you a lot, because I think the capital markets along with life companies have been providing the extra competition that have pushed pricing down. And so when you see a hiccup in that space, like you saw on the CMBS markets and like you saw with the wider spread, it's interesting to me that you can feel it pretty quickly. I don't think that's necessarily a positive thing. I think it tells you how sensitive the market can be to the mood swings of those capital markets.","Having said that, at the same time, I think, what's interesting, Geoffrey, is that competition didn't change an ounce with the smaller institutions. They are working on their balance sheets, they are not necessarily looking at the capital markets and competition on that front remains pretty intense when it came to smaller institutions.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thanks. I just had one quick one, Ren\u00e9, on the GAAP and operating EPS differential. So we have been seeing a convergence between the two up until the last couple of quarters, obviously with Hudson City and its \u2013 the merger related expense line item where we've seen some of the disconnect, and I was hoping you could give a sense for what that looks like going forward? You mentioned earlier $10 million to $14 million in restructuring charges next quarter and that's it? Is that in that merger related expense line item? Any color around that would be helpful.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. No, you've got it. You got it exactly. We would expect that \u2013 we don't expect to see much if anything in the second half of the year, so that should normalize again, with the exception that maybe from a year ago we might have slightly higher amortization on the [indiscernible].","Bill Carcache","Perfect. That makes sense. My other questions have been answered. Thank you.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Frank. You are allowing me to say good afternoon.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning or good afternoon, that's right. Oh, man, I've to change my script here. Just two quick real ones, if I could. First on the NIM, setting aside where you ended up in the quarter in lieu of further rate hikes, and no rate hikes through the rest of 2016, directionally from here, is it reasonable to assume a few basis points of core compression a quarter in this environment is that still reasonable?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think that, in that scenario you painted, that's exactly right and I think all of that compression would be coming from the time account book at Hudson City and depending on what we do. So if we changed course, because we thought it wasn't beneficial to us, we weren't capturing customers from that profile, we could just change it and then I think it would go back to flat.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. Okay. Great. And then just one on repurchases, you went through the reasoning for, I think it's $54 million in the additional share buyback. And I realize it'll be a small incremental number and, I don't know, maybe the process is different, but if you had to go get the non-objection from regulators, what is the thinking about not seeking or asking for the full additional 1% of Tier 1 capital, which seems like could've been on the table?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It sounds funny, but we just simply followed our process. We had asked for a certain amount of distributions in the plan. We think it makes sense to follow that process. And then we sort of, as we started looking at post the deal, we realized that, well, we haven't distributed all the dividends. And so, one, on its face, we should probably go back and add, and then it just so happened that that also fits within the context of the 1% rule as well. I think our number would've been something like \u2013 total number would've been $92 million, $93 million, $94 million, but I don't know. It just seemed like we were focused on distributing the same capital that we asked to distribute and we kept it at that. Obviously, the 1% rule if you needed it down the road would be bigger now because our capital base in the test is bigger. But having said that, from our view, we should just be focused on trying to do \u2013 figure out what the right thing to do is based on the test, project that and stick to it is how I would think about it.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. All right. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Samantha, and good morning everyone. I'd like to thank you all for participating in M&T's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call both by telephone, and through the webcast. If you have not read today's earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.","Also before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thanks Don, and good morning everyone.","As noted in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the second quarter include the continuation of several favorable trends. Loan growth continues to be in line with our expectations for low single-digit aggregate growth in 2019. We saw healthy growth in fees particularly mortgage banking and trust income compared with both prior quarter and the year-ago quarter.","Credit quality remains solid with net charge-offs just over half of our long-term average notwithstanding an increase from the unusually low level we saw in the first quarter. We continue to return excess capital beyond what is needed to support growth of the balance sheet, including $402 million of common share repurchases and paying $135 million of common stock dividends.","During the quarter, we successfully completed the onboarding of $13 billion of owned mortgage servicing as well as $17 billion of sub-servicing. These portfolios added to mortgage fee revenue, non-interest expenses, servicing related purchases of mortgage loans and non-maturity interest-bearing deposits.","At the same time, the interest rate environment has become more volatile than at any point in recent memory, impacting our outlook for net interest margin and spread revenues, which we will discuss in more detail in a few moments.","Now let's take a look at the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.34 for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $3.35 in the first quarter of 2019, and $3.26 in the second quarter of 2018.","Net income for the quarter was $473 million compared with $483 million in the linked quarter and $493 million in the year ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.60% in an annualized return on average common equity of 12.68%.","This compares with rates of 1.68% and 13.14% respectively in the previous quarter. Including GAAP results in the recent quarter were the after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $4 million or $0.03 per common share, little change from the prior quarter.","Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions, when they occur.","M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which includes intangible amortization was $477 million compared with $486 million in the linked quarter and $498 million in last year's second quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.37 for the recent quarter compared with $3.38 in 2019\u2019s first quarter and $3.29 in the second quarter of 2018. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.68% and 18.83% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.76% and 19.56% in the first quarter of 2019.","In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the first and second quarters of 2019 were impacted by certain noteworthy items. Our results for the first quarter of 2019 included a $37 million cash distribution from Bayview Lending Group reflected in other revenues from operations.","This amounted to $28 million after-tax effect or $0.20 per diluted common share. Also affecting results for the first quarter was an addition to our legal reserves of $50 million relating to a subsidiaries role as trustee for customers employee stock ownership plans. This amounted to $37 million after-tax effect or $0.27 per diluted common share.","Reflected in the second quarter of 2019s results was a $48 million write-down of M&T's investment in an asset manager, which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. That amounted to $36 million after-tax effect or $0.27 per common share.","In July 2019, M&T agreed to sell its investment in the asset manager, which had been obtained in the 2011 acquisition of the Wilmington Trust Corporation.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.05 billion in the second quarter of 2019 down by $9 million or 1% from the linked quarter. This reflects a narrow net interest margin, partially offset by growth in both loans and total earning assets. The margin for the quarter was 3.91%, down 13 basis points from 4.04% in the linked quarter.","Factors contributing to that decline include the higher level of cash on deposit at the Fed, which accounted for an estimated three basis points of the decline in margin, a higher day count in the quarter compared to the first quarter, which accounted for 1 basis point of that decline. We estimate that market rates primarily from LIBOR moving lower in advance of an anticipated cut in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve accounted for some two basis points of the decline, which this - has been consistent with our recent experience where LIBOR moves in advance of Fed funds, only now it is in the opposite direction.","The higher cost of interest bearing deposits accounted for approximately 7 basis points of the decline, sharply higher mortgage escrow deposits in conjunction with our growth in mortgage servicing much of which are indexed to a mix of Fed funds and LIBOR are the primary driver of that increase.","The expected continued migration of deposits into higher yielding categories, notably, commercial deposits into interest checking and on balance sheet [sweep] [ph], as well as a higher cost of time deposits as new certificates that are issued at higher rates than maturing loans were also factors.","Average loans grew by 1% compared with the previous quarter. Originations remain solid, while payoffs and paydowns picked up a little compared to the first quarter but remain below our experience in the second half of 2018.","Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased 1% compared with the linked quarter. Commercial real estate loans also grew 1% compared with the first quarter with a slightly lower proportion of construction loans compared with permanent financing.","Residential real estate loans declined by about 1% compared to the linked quarter. The continued comparatively steady pace of planned pay downs of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City transaction was partially offset by the purchase of government guaranteed mortgage loans out of the recently acquired servicing pools.","While that practice will continue, it was somewhat elevated this quarter in connection with the onboarding of the mortgage servicing, we acquired. We expect the aggregate portfolio to resume its low double-digit rate of principal amortization in future quarters.","Consumer loans were up about 2%. Growth in recreation finance loans continue to outpace declines in home equity lines and loans. Regionally, loan growth was somewhat stronger in our metro region, which includes New York and Philadelphia, as well as in the Mid-Atlantic. New Jersey continues to show solid growth off a low base.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and certificates of deposit over $250,000 grew an estimated 2% compared with the first quarter. This primarily reflects the escrow deposits we referenced earlier.","Deposits received at the Cayman Islands office increased by $275 million. As noted last quarter, commercial customers continue to seek a higher yield on excess funds in demand accounts and often achieve that by sweeping around in the short-term interest-bearing deposits.","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $512 million in the second quarter compared with $501 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $107 million in the recent quarter compared with $95 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $723 million in the quarter, up substantially from $422 million in the first quarter, reflecting the lower, long-term interest rate environment, as well as the seasonal strength.","Total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were $72 million in the second quarter, improved from $66 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily the result of the additional residential loan servicing and sub-servicing that we acquire combined with higher gain on sale revenues.","Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $35 million in the second quarter compared with $29 million in the linked quarter reflecting seasonally stronger origination activity. Trust income was $144 million in the recent quarter, improved from $133 million in the previous quarter. This quarter's results include $4 million of seasonal fees earned in assisting clients with their tax filings. The rebound in the equity markets from the sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018 also contributed to the linked quarter growth.","Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, up from $103 million in the first quarter, reflecting higher levels of activity from what is usually a seasonally slower first quarter. The recent quarter also included $9 million in securities gains, representing the valuation gains on equity securities, while the first quarter of 2019, including $12 million of similar valuation gains.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were $868 million. As previously noted, the recent quarter's results include a $48 million write-down of our investment in an asset manager acquired in the Wilmington Trust merger. Also included in the quarter's results, was a $9 million valuation reserve on our mortgage servicing rights, reflecting the recent decline in long-term interest rates.","Salaries and benefits were $456 million in the quarter, down $0.4 million from the seasonally higher level in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects annual merit increases, the salary adjustments we made in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as further adds to staff as we expand our pool of IT talents. We continue to expect to offset this hiring over time by reducing our use of consultants and contractors.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 56% in the recent quarter compared to 57.6% in 2019's first quarter. Those ratios reflect legal related accrual and write-down, we noted earlier.","Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remains in line with our expectations. Annualized net charge-offs, as a percentage of total loans were 20 basis points for the second quarter compared with 10 basis points in the first quarter. That reflects higher net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolios.","The provision for credit losses was $55 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $11 million. The excess provision primarily reflects loan growth. The allowance for credit losses increased to $1.03 billion at the end of June compared with $1.02 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was unchanged at 1.15%.","Non-accrual loans declined by $16 million at June 30 compared with the end of March. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans improved by 3 basis points ending the quarter at 0.96%. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were $349 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $320 million or 92% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9.84% at June 30 compared with 10.03% at the end of the first quarter. The 19 basis point decline reflects the impact of higher loan balances, earnings retention and capital distributions.","During the second quarter, M&T repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $402 million. The 2019 capital plan announced late last month contemplates net capital distributions of $1.9 billion over the four quarter period beginning this month. Our reference to net distributions reflects our intention to examine the current, non-common equity components of our regulatory capital structure in the coming months.","Now turning to the outlook. As we noted at the beginning of the call, the interest rate outlook has changed materially over the past 90 days, impacting the outlook for M&T as well. We continue to expect growth in total loans in 2019 to be at a low single-digit pace with continued run-off in residential mortgages more than offset by aggregate growth in other loan categories. The forward curve is implying reductions in short-term interest rates, possibly starting as early as the end of this month and continuing over the next few quarters.","Recall that, following the Fed's December action to raise rates, we took further steps to hedge our asset liability position by layering on additional received fixed paced floating interest rate swaps. While our balance sheet is much less asset sensitive than it was previously, we expect lower rates to result in less growth in net interest income than we previously thought.","At this point, we estimate that all else being equal and holding aside volatility in certain deposit categories, each hypothetical reduction of 25 basis points in the Fed funds target should result in 5 basis points to 8 basis points of margin pressure over the ensuing 12 months. With these changes in mind, we still expect year-over-year growth in net interest income for 2019.","The previously announced servicing and sub-servicing acquisitions have increased our mortgage banking revenues above the outlook we shared on our January call. Lower long-term interest rates have led to a pickup in residential mortgage loan originations, but not enough to further change that outlook beyond the impact of the servicing addition.","Our outlook for the remaining fee categories remains unchanged with growth in the low single-digit range, except for trust income, which should be in the mid single-digit range, but remains vulnerable to market volatility.","The write-down of the investment in the asset manager was obviously not contemplated in our earlier expense guidance. As we noted earlier, the acquisition of on payroll IT talent reflected in salaries and benefits over the first half, should be offset by lower contractor and consulting expenses over the coming quarters. Beyond that, with the revenue outlook being more subdued than we previously thought, we are examining our spending, as we look forward.","Our outlook for credit remains little changed, credit cost moved from an unsustainably low level in the first quarter to a level, still well below long-term averages during the second quarter. We're watching criticized loans, which look like they will be down this quarter from the end of March.","M&T's capital allocation philosophy and policies remain consistent with our previous thoughts. To summarize, we believe that our current capital levels are higher than what is necessary to operate in a safe and sound manner given our history of solid credit underwriting and low earnings volatility. As such, our intention remains to manage our capital to a more appropriate level over time.","The 2019 capital plan is lower than the plan for 2018, basically reflecting the fact that the Fed's template used year-end 2018 capital levels at the start point which were some 86 basis points lower than year-end 2017, combined with stress test losses calculated by the Fed for the 2018 CCAR exercise.","As noted earlier, the 2019 plan contemplates net capital distributions of some $1.9 billion with gross distributions potentially higher as we examine the non-common components of our regulatory capital and monitor growth in loans and risk-weighted assets. Lastly, we'll continue to watch the Fed's rulemaking on stress testing capital levels including stress capital buffer and liquidity coverage ratio as we develop our capital plans beyond 2019.","Of course, as you're aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now, let's open up the call for questions, before which Samantha will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Just a little bit of - to get a little bit of color around the other expense line, I know you indicated I had originally include the $48 million Bayview and if - and then was the legal charge also that $50 million is that also in that line item?","Darren King","Yes. In the first quarter, other expense included the addition to the litigation reserve, and in the second quarter, it included the write-down of the asset manager, as well as there was $9 million of the mortgage servicing reserve as well.","John Pancari","Right. Okay, so excluding that, how should we think about a good basis to grow off of as we go into the second half on that line?","Darren King","I guess if you look at the other expense line and you look at it over the last five quarters, excluding kind of what I would describe as a special, so the litigation addition, and the - in the write-down of the equity investment, you'll see that that line is relatively consistent around 165, 170, it moves up and down a little bit and that's the place where over time we will expect to see some decrease in the professional services related to our IT spend.","And that will start to come into play over the last half of 2019 and into 2020, but it will take a little bit of time to for those expenses to ramp down as we bring on new staff and train them and deploy them on projects, there is a bit of a tail effect where it takes a while for the outside IT professionals to finish the work that they're doing, doesn\u2019t make sense to replace the midstream.","And so that's where you'll see some of that and also while we added to the litigation reserve in the first quarter, there is still some ongoing expense for that case in some of that will show up in the professional services or in that other cost of operations line as well.","So it should be - if you exclude those things look at kind of where the average has been for the last few quarters and use that as a start point and start to decline at probably more in 2020 than in 2019, that's the way I think about it.","John Pancari","And then also on the expense front, as we look out into 2020 and given the backdrop that you acknowledged around the rate environment, can you - how do you think about operating leverage for 2020, is that still a high expectation that you'll be able to achieve that or is there a risk to that, given the ray backdrop?","Darren King","It's a great question, John. We're in the process of going through forecasting 2020 and starting to look at where we think revenue will be and what that might mean for expense growth and probably a little early to handicap where 2020 looks, but obviously, given a slower net interest income growth picture that makes positive operating leverage, a little tougher to achieve and we're obviously we're also not going to short change the investments we need to make in the business for the sake of a couple of quarters of a positive operating leverage. I don't think it will be wildly negative, if it is, but we've got work to do before we comment on what 2020 will be, we'll give you guys an update obviously in January on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Just a follow-up on your comments on the rate. Thanks for the commentary about what each 25 basis point means, if I'm doing the math right. I guess 5 to 8 basis points on a 25-cut, that's what like 50 million to 80 million depending on annually?","Darren King","Yes.","Ken Usdin","So I guess the question is what's baked into your forecast then in terms of that new expectation that NII will grow a little bit this year relative to your prior expectations. Have you built forecast into that - cuts into that forecast formally and if so how many? Thank you.","Darren King","Yes, we usually run our ALCO models and off of the forward curves. And so we will look at the forward curves at the end of June and use that as the basis for forecasting our NII for the rest of the year. You can kind of see in where LIBOR\u2019s move that some of that's already started to happen. So I guess the question is how much incremental movement there is in LIBOR when and if the Fed actually moves. So I think a little bit of it's already kind of happened and then we'll see where things end up, but the direct answer to your question is, based off the forward curves and run at the end of June.","Ken Usdin","Okay, understood that is what I was getting at thanks. And then on the ability to control deposits costs and anticipate the mix shift, what are you seeing in terms of customers and what are you deciding in ALCO about how you're pricing deposits relative to that view of the curve? Thanks.","Darren King","Yes, so when you look underneath the second quarter activity on deposit pricing, there is really two things. So, one is the addition of the escrow balances that came with the servicing that we did and actually those grew through the quarter and we actually expect them to grow into the third quarter as well. When you hold that to the side, what we saw in the second quarter was a continuation of the trends that we saw in the first, where we still see some commercial excess balances moving into interest checking and into on-balance sheet sweep.","And we continue to see some consumer migration into time although that slowed down a little bit and really the time increases in the second quarter were driven by renewals of CDs that were actually coming off at a lower rate than where rates were and still in the one to two year and greater than two year space. If we look at the increase in time deposits in the second quarter, it was less than it was in the first and looked a lot more like what it did in the fourth quarter.","And so most of the reactivity in deposit pricing that happened early on was in the commercial space and in the institutional space and in the wealth space and many of those accounts are tied to an index. And so as the index comes down those will move down faster. On the consumer side they\u2019ll probably be a little bit slower, just because the cycle, the repricing cycle never fully matured and the way it tends to work is people move money into CDs first and then once those rate stabilize, they tend to look for liquidity and they move back into money market that second step didn't happen.","And so a lot of the consumer money that sits in certificates of deposits will be there for a while. It will take renewals for - those rates to come down. I guess the good news is that they shouldn\u2019t probably go up much from here either [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","If I could follow-up on Ken's question as you know - thank you for giving us some of the assumptions that you have for the five to eight basis points of compression. I'm wondering for each 25 basis points what is the reverse beta that you're assuming specifically on the deposit side and does it - is it naturally wider for the, let's say the third cut versus the first cut?","Darren King","Sure so when we disclosed in the Q, our ALCO runs they are obviously 100 basis point increments, when we do our work we do it in 25. And what we expect to see is the continued lag affect of deposit repricing continue into the third quarter. Usually takes two or three quarters for that to slowdown after the Fed stops. So even if they decrease rates at the end of July we\u2019re likely still to see a little bit of movement in deposit rates. And then as we go from there, we'll start to see them come down, the rate of decrease in the deposits will be kind of consistent with what I mentioned before with Ken and that\u2019s for the indexed deposits obviously there'll be 100% reactive.","And then for our other customer deposits movement out of suite back into DDA, I think it'll be a function of customers\u2019 businesses and cash flow. Not sure how quickly that will change, but we\u2019ll obviously be paying attention to the pricing there. And then on the consumer side, I think we'll continue to see a slowdown of the remixing hope the pressure will be as older CDs mature and come on to the books at a slightly higher rate, which is why we\u2019ll see a little bit of repricing there. I think as it relates to the third quarter and deposit cost specifically, I'll just remind you again that - we're expecting continued increase in escrow balances.","And those are linked to an index either to LIBOR or to Fed funds, there is a little bit of different pricing depending on which portfolio it is. And so, those will have an impact on deposit pricing specifically or deposit costs in the third quarter.","Erika Najarian","And just as a follow up. Could you give us a sense of how much of your interest bearing deposits are indexed and would reprice immediately. And could you please remind us and - with the size of your swap book and the average life please. The total new notional since you added some swaps on in the quarter? Thank you.","Darren King","Sure, so the swap book - the swaps that are currently in effect is about $13.5 million, $14 million of notional. And if you look at the remainder that's out there, which I think will show around $39 billion in the Q is our forward starting. And so, that should give you a sense of where the swaps are. And those should go out approximately two to two in a quarter years based on where we are right now. I should wrote down your first question. Remind me again your first question.","Erika Najarian","Apologies, what percentage of your interest-bearing deposits are tied to an index and therefore would reprice immediately when Fed fund goes down?","Darren King","It's approximately 12%.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Darren King","Of total deposits.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Darren King","Total deposits, obviously it plays a bigger percent of interest checking.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi with Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Just wondering Darren on the, just one more on the margin - the five to eight basis points seems like that's baking in the expectation that this drag in deposit pricing is going to be - is going to continue here for a little bit. If we don't get a rate hike or rate cut rather I'm just wondering what the margin would look like and your expectation of sort of margin outlook without - those baked in rate hikes or rate cuts going forward?","Darren King","Sure, so within the margin and in the go-forward, there is a couple things that are important to keep in mind. So when we talk about the five to eight, we were specific about saying holding some other deposit categories constant that - creates volatility in the market. So obviously cash balances, as we've talked about a lot, they were worth five basis points of expansion. The decrease in cash balances in the first quarter expanded the margin by five basis points. They contracted the margin by three basis points this past quarter.","And so those we kind of hold aside and because they can move around and they affect the margin, but not so much the net interest income. The other thing is that moving around right now is just the mortgage escrow balances. And as those roll on and we get so what we think is a more stable balance, we'll be able to give a little bit better guidance on our expectations on the impact of escrow. So if nothing changed in the second quarter, third quarter there\u2019s probably some margin compression because of those escrow balances.","And so any movement would be on top of that, excluding what's already been priced in. If we didn't have the escrow balances, and I mean, held cash balances constant, and you didn't see a change in rates from the Fed. I think we'd see pretty stable margin like the plus or minus 2 to 3 basis points, some because of the natural extension of deposit pricing and then some just because of roll-on, roll-off margins in the loan book.","Frank Schiraldi","And then there's been some recent reports out and the media talking about some branch reduction in the Philadelphia areas some consolidation and reinvesting into tech and I guess modernizing the remaining branches. Just kind of curious, if you could talk maybe a little bit about that, but more generally just your brand strategy here more broadly?","Darren King","Sure. So now I'll talk specifically about Philadelphia. So if you look at our market position in Philadelphia, and I think we have about 1% deposit share in a fairly similar brand share, which even as things move electronic, we find that customers still value branches as a place that they can go and get advice and solve problems as well as - and it provides a sense of security, they are there for a long period of time.","And our focus in Philadelphia by shrinking, isn't to ignore those things, but more to recognize that our strength there has really been in the commercial space and in particular with small business customers and we're aggregating or concentrating our efforts in Philadelphia in the markets where there is a concentration of small business customers and where we've had some success there, and we'll really orient the branch in the activities there to support the activities of our small business and commercial customers.","Our experience has been the - while this is customers tend to use only one branch and that one tends to be close to their business. So we think that that's a better way for us to compete there. And as we reduce the footprint, we'll take some of the savings and invest it in the remaining branches.","When you look more broadly, we have markets where we have really high share both in terms of deposits and branches and markets where we have a little bit less. We're going to be looking at what we do at Philadelphia and how that works in combination with the investments we're making in digital and to learn from that and see how that works and will - depending on how that goes, we will adjust our strategy there, if we like it, will probably see it rollout into a few other geographies.","And then when you look at the markets where we're a little bit more dense, I would describe our branch thoughts as consistent with our prior practices whereby we look at the total network each year. We look at which locations both branches and ATMs are favored by our customers and then we make adjustments to the network each year given - given that information.","We're always trying to make sure that we provide convenience and access to our customers and while managing our cost structure, so that we can be competitive. The nice part is in banking customers vote with their feet every day and we get to use the results of that vote to help us shape the network and that's the way we've always thought about distribution and we'll continue to.","Frank Schiraldi","But this is more thought of as a reinvestment opportunity as opposed to cost cuts, cost cutting initiative. Is that fair or maybe both?","Darren King","Yes, I think it's really both. We will clearly over time have some safe. But for all of our colleagues in that geography, they will be placed in one of the branches that remains open, usually there is turnover in those offices in over time, whether that is replaced or not will be a function of how busy the locations are, but we will be saving some of the occupancy expense, will reinvest a little bit of that in the end of the existing locations in some of that will save.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Couple of questions more clarifications then anything, first on the net interest income guide I forget the exact terms you use, but you said you expect to see some growth in 2019 full year versus 2018, by my calculations, that you're basically baking in, I think something in the neighborhood of $1 billion and change in net interest income run rate in the second half of the year quarterly is that it may, I'll just obviously place some reduction in the run rate, but is that more or less correct that math?","Darren King","Yes, that's correct, is probably based on the current forward curves. It probably comes down a little bit each quarter, but we'll be a little bit over $1 billion. Yes.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And then again a clarification. Great color on all the moving parts on deposit costs, and why you think it could be stickier is even as the Fed cut, but I guess, putting all of that together, would you expect deposit cost to actually rise in the third quarter versus the second quarter if I'm looking at your overall cost of interest bearing deposits that wasn't clear if that's what to me at least, is that, if that's what you're basically saying?","Darren King","Sure. So the short answer is, yes. And I'll give you color on that, it's, yes, because of the growth in the mortgage escrow balances that we anticipate. If those weren't there, we would expect a little bit of increase in our deposit cost just because of the last little bit of remixing that tends to happen for two to three quarters after the Fed stops.","When you look at that - when you look at just that effect, it was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter and we anticipate that the third quarter would be lower still and then it would kind of be done by the time we get to the fourth quarter.","Will it slow more quickly to zero in the third quarter, if the Fed reduces hard to handicap just given some of the repricing CDs and the fact that they're rolling off at a lower rate than they will roll onto there's probably still a little bit of push there, but that's, those are the two elements. And I want to make sure I'm explicit about what's driving it, because one of the things that's kind of in the five to eight and the other one is 10 and up.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So if we were to see two cuts, let's say, one in July and September, October, when would you think you would actually start to see deposit start to come down, is it sort of late years for early part of next year and how do you think about that lag in this cycle?","Darren King","Yes, I guess, so again with the nuance of the escrow balances, I think the whole and again holding onto to the side. You would see a modest increase in deposit costs in the third quarter and I think you'll start to see them either flatten out or decrease in the fourth quarter and just because of the fact that there are several categories that are index, those would give you a benefit, right away with the cuts and if those other categories like the time deposits, as well as just people shifting still from non-interest bearing into interest bearing our suite.","I put no modest upward pressure on it. But, I would expect that you see a little bit in the third quarter and by the time we get to the fourth quarter, you probably start to see it level out or decrease.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with KSP Research.","Kevin St. Pierre","Just circling back to expenses in conjunction with overall strategy. Darren, you and - both you and Rene have characterized M&T is being somewhat behind from a tax perspective and needing to catch up, maybe you could characterize for us where you think you are from that perspective along the timeline in catching up to competitors from a mobile and digital perspective?","Darren King","Sure. So I think over the last 18 months, we've made some really great strides in our technical environment, our mobile app continues to get updated on a regular basis with the new feature functionality coming, basically every six months, if not sooner. And it's in a pretty good spot. When we look at the feature functionality that is most used by customers.","We feel pretty good about what we have. I think the next focus is in there is on security features and more self-service and security features. When we look at the commercial part of the bank, we've just gone into production with our loan origination system. And so we're getting that up and running and the team up to speed.","And we continue to make investments in our treasury management platform, which will make things easier, both for our employees and for our customers and should bring us a lot closer to parity with our peer group if not towards some of the larger players. And we're making investments in our merchant capabilities.","Within the bank, we continue to invest in infrastructure. We invest in securities, things like cyber security and how we protect the bank and our customers, as well as in the data. So we're investing along all of those categories and we continue to make progress, but I think as you know and we all know that it's a bit of a moving target too. So each time you catch up some of that, something to get a little bit ahead and I think that's the nature of Rene's comments and my comments about you're never really there because the bar is always moving and you're continually investing.","And we just kind of think about our tech spend is we've got to spend to keep in the game to stay competitive and to react to the changes that are happening in all of our businesses, whether it's in the commercial business, the consumer business, the wealth and private banking business or the institutional business, and that's just going to be a way of life. And because of that, that's why we're making the investments we are in the tech hub and in adding IT professionals to our on-staff team, because as technology continues to become a bigger part of banking.","Then, you want to control that resource and not have a walk out the door and into someone else's operations the next day because they are an outside contractor. The outside contract can help you get there quickly and if you bring our skill set but you don't have in the short-term. But over the long-term - such a strategic asset that we would rather control it and that's why you see us making those investments.","Kevin St. Pierre","Great, and so as we think about the impact on the income statement, we can expect that the salaries and benefits is going to have this natural upward drift as you continue to invest in people?","Darren King","Yes, you\u2019ll see that happen. You\u2019ll see some from the first half to the second half, just because of that, as well as the full effect of the mortgage servicing that we brought on and the people that help with that. The offset over time will be in that other cost of operations line that we talked about. The trick is and the thing to keep in mind is just the timing of that right.","And if we have to, we have to add the new facility and build it out and get people there before we can consolidate other states then we have some double counting, if you will in that time period. As we bring on new focus to the team and train them up with - sometimes they\u2019re experienced professionals and they come up to speed faster or they could be new recruits.","And they take a little bit longer that you've got that overlap in time period where you get the new ones up to speed, before you can reduce the expense on the other side. And we don't expect that this is hundreds of millions of dollars by any stretch because we'll take it as increments. We think that's also a better way to manage the change as well as the cost, but it's going to be something that will be consistent over the next several quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","A couple of questions as we see some of the smaller banks report numbers this quarter, the trend of these one-off credit events seem to be popping up again. Are you guys seeing now that the margin pressure is picking up for everyone. Is there any evidence yet of more aggressive loan underwriting by banks to grow their balance sheets to offset this margin pressure?","Darren King","It's an interesting question. And when we look at payoffs and paydowns and we talk about that, we track it by what the source of the payoff or paydown was. And kind of to your point, what's been interesting this year so far is other banks have been a bigger source of payoffs and paydowns for us, than it has been private equity or funds or insurance. So there might be a little bit to that. And I guess, when we compete in the market from our perspective, we always feel like others are losers structure and lower on price, then we would want to be.","And so it's hard for me to say that there is a specific change, but it was notable when we were going through the numbers, that we did see a little bit higher proportion of other banks as a source of payoffs and paydowns in the first half of this year.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, and then based on your experience, you pointed out that you guys have used the forward curves to forecast out your margins. This is not something new of course, How accurate in your opinion, are the forward curves in predicting where rates actually go at this - in this kind of a new rate environment we're in, when you have to forecast out 12 months. I would think they're very accurate over the very short periods 30 days or so, but how about if you go out into six and 12 months in your experience they\u2019re very accurate?","Darren King","I don't know Gerard that sounds like a loaded question to me. I think we've all seen the charts that have been put together that always show the forward curves. At the moment in time against the actuals and I guess what - but my experience has been as if the forward curves are not very good predictors of the actuals. But they're good predictors of the direction.","Gerard Cassidy","Yes, I agree with that.","Darren King","And so, we obviously we use that in the absence of a better way to forecast, but also, that's why we use the hedges right. Is that we look at where the margin is and how that compares to long-term average and we take into account some of the deposit reactivity. And then just the shape of the balance sheet and that's why we use the hedging to try and take that volatility out of our earnings and that's what gives us the whereabouts when things get a little volatile like they've been late to - did not have to be overly draconian on expenses.","And allows us to make sure that we can maintain the investments back to the question, that Kevin was asking in particular about our ability to invest in technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","One real quick question, I know there's a lot of conversation around the expenses. So I was trying to keep up with everything. But I mean, directionally if you want to take that operating expense base from the second quarter, does it sounds like that's going to be higher in the third and fourth quarter before you start to see, like you said, some of the double spend that you have come out in 2020, is that's the right way to think about it?","Darren King","Yes, I guess so the way that I would look at the second half is, if you look at our expenses in the first half, and you take out the big things the write-down and the asset manager and the litigation reserve.","Brian Klock","Yes.","Darren King","That's probably a good guide for where the second half will show up, you know it's should be pretty similar to that that takes into account, the investments that we're making in the tech hub. The full-year cost of the mortgage servicing colleagues that we added and some of the other expenses that we foresee in the second half.","Brian Klock","And just another follow-up on the capital discussion yeah, does it sound like when you look at the 1.9 billion net that you talked about, having in the capital plan and now yesterday, the Board approved up to what $1.645 billion and a buyback. So does that imply that you're as you mentioned something in the neighborhood of about 300 million or 350 million of a preferred issuance possible in the future. Is that what you're thinking?","Darren King","Yes that was, that's in the ballpark of where our thought process was. I think the logic there is, when you look over the last several years of CCAR, Tier 1 Capital has become our binding constraint as much as CET1. And so, as we contemplated the plan this year, we are looking at the mix and the ratios of Tier 1 to CET1, and think there is an opportunity for us to just re-stack the capital a little bit to make sure that we're in good shape going into CCAR 2020.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Don MacLeod","Again, thank you all for participating today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the M&T Bank First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. MacLeod, please go ahead.","Donald J. MacLeod","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for participating in M&T's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast.","If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules, from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I\u2019d like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I get into the discussion of M&T's results for the first quarter, let me say a few words about the announcement we made on Friday regarding the pending Hudson City merger.","I believe this is the first time since current management came to M&T that we have had to publicly disclose a matter arising from a discussion with our regulators. However, in this case, because it has an impact on the pending merger, we are able to make a limited statement.","As you may recall, we announced the merger in August of last year. Apart from any issues specific to M&T, in terms of context, the industry is already in a regulatory environment that seems clearly heightened in at least 2 relevant ways. First, if you look at recent merger activity in the banking sector, the trend seems to be that it's taking notably longer to get regulatory approvals. Said another way, we don't take regulatory approval for granted. Second, industry as a whole is subject to a heightened regulatory environment and expectations, including bank's -- the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance programs. So that's the context in which our Hudson City deal is taking place.","During the 7 months we've been working on the Hudson City merger, we, of course, were also involved in our normal ongoing discussions with our regulators as part of the continuous supervisory process. In addition, we have been continuously working on scaling up and strengthening the overall risk management infrastructure of our growing bank, along with planned improvements to the BSA\/AML process.","We recently were made aware of the fact that certain deficiencies in our BSA\/AML compliance program rose to a level of significance such that they would impact our ability to close the merger with Hudson City in the near term and that we would have to implement the plan for improvement and demonstrate its efficacy [ph] to satisfaction of M&T management, our board and the regulators prior to obtaining regulatory approvals for the merger. Our ongoing investment includes bolstering internal staff and hiring an outside consultant to help us evaluate and improve our governance, people, processes, controls and systems. Fortunately, these efforts are already under way.","Of course, we then talked things over with Hudson City. Both companies remain strongly committed to this merger as it is a highly beneficial transaction for each of us for all the reasons we've discussed previously. So we mutually decided that we would proceed with our shareholder meetings on the merger and would also allow more time under our agreement, an additional 5 months, while M&T works hard to resolve these issues. We definitely appreciate the fact that Hudson City has been a totally supportive and steadfast partner in this.","So what are the regulatory issues? As you know, we have obligations to keep supervisory information confidential. So there is a limit to how expansive we can be today. And we can only talk about what we know as we sit here today. While we don't anticipate any other material issues cropping up as we get into this, of course that can never be completely ruled out. We have no reason to believe that the issues involve any wrongdoing or illegal conduct by anyone in M&T work or any identifiable instances of actual money laundering activity using our bank.","Independent of the merger, we are fully committed to resolving the BSA\/AML compliance concerns and to carry out any further requirements our regulators may ask of us that we are not aware of today. It is important to note that these things take time.","However, we should be helped by who we are -- who and what we are. Compared to some other institutions that have had these issues, M&T is relatively uncomplicated and locally focused business. We don't have any significant international operations and don't have the kinds of diverse complex businesses that the larger money center banks are engaged in. However, we do have a lot to do as we take having strong compliance programs seriously.","With that said, we are optimistic that we can make the progress that we need to make to satisfy our regulators and to obtain regulatory approval for this merger. And I know both parties are as firm as ever that this is a deal worth getting done. And that's why M&T and Hudson City remain strongly committed to the deal and to do whatever we need to do to see it through.","Next, I'd like to review the highlights from our first quarter results, after which Don and I will take your questions. The results were comparatively strong, exceeding our internal projections and get us off to a good start for 2013.","Turning to the specific numbers, diluted GAAP earnings per share were $1.98 in the first quarter of 2013, up 32% from $1.50 in the last -- in last year's first quarter. When you compare this to the $2.16 in the first -- fourth quarter of 2012, the decline reflects lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonally higher equity compensation and benefits costs.","Net income for the recent quarter was $274 million, up from $206 million in last year's first quarter. Net income was $296 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Other than our normal seasonal uptick in compensation and benefits expense, there was very little in the way of unusual items in our first quarter results.","Since 1998, M&T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effects of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions.","Included in GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2013 where after-tax merger-related expenses related to the Hudson City acquisition amounting to $3 million after tax or $0.02 per common share. There were no merger-related expenses in the fourth quarter of last year.","After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $8 million, unchanged from the prior quarter, and this amounted to $0.06 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter.","M&T's net operating income for the quarter, which excludes those items, was $285 million compared with $305 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.06 for the recent quarter, up 30% from the first quarter of 2012. The comparable figure was $2.23 in the linked quarter.","Net operating income, expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity, was 1.48% and 18.71% for the recent quarter, up from 1.18% and 16.79% in the year ago quarter.","Said another way, we increased our return on tangible common equity by nearly 200 basis points. On an average tangible common equity base, that is nearly $1 billion higher than the first quarter of 2012. The comparable returns were at 1.56% and 20.46% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $663 million for the first quarter of 2013 compared with $674 million in the linked quarter. The decline compared with the linked quarter is entirely due to the lower day count.","In line with the guidance we offered in January of this year, the net interest margin contracted by 3 basis points to 3.71% during the first quarter compared with 3.74% in the fourth quarter. The reduction in margin is almost entirely due to what I characterize as core compression as yields on new loans, both commercial and consumer, is -- are somewhat lower than that on maturing loans. This asset side pressure is being slightly offset by a lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including lower rates on core deposits.","While the day count diminished the net interest income, it added about 2 basis points to the reported margin, and that was offset by a 2-basis-point decline as a result of the lower loan fees as compared with the fourth quarter.","As for the balance sheet, loan growth for the first quarter was pretty much in line with our outlook as average loans increased by $840 million or an annualized 5% from the fourth quarter. On that same basis, compared with 2012's fourth quarter, changes in average loans by category were as follows: commercial & industrial loans grew by an annualized 8%, commercial real estate loans grew by an annualized 9%, residential real estate loans were up 2%, while consumer loans declined an annualized 5%. Upstate New York and our metro region, which includes greater New York City, Philadelphia and New Jersey areas, experienced the strongest loan growth in both C&I loans and commercial real estate loans, while loans in the mid-Atlantic declined slightly.","On an end-of-period basis, loans declined an annualized 4%. A fair amount of the borrowing activity that we saw late in the fourth quarter was done by customers in anticipation of changes to tax rates and was comprised of short-term and bridge-type loans that paid down relatively quickly.","The average investment securities continued to decline as a result of the -- as a result of paydowns, combined with our low appetite for reinvesting in the current rate environment.","Average core customer deposits, which excludes deposits received at M&T's Cayman branch and CDs over $250,000, grew at an annualized 2%. And during the quarter, we were opportunistic and took advantage of the tighter spreads in the capital market by issuing $800 million of unsecured bank notes. The $500 million fixed-rate tranche carried a 5-year fixed rate of 1.45%, while the $300 million floating-rate tranche was issued at a 3-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points.","Turning to noninterest income.  Noninterest income totaled $433 million in the first quarter compared with $453 million in the prior quarter, and improved by 15% from $378 million in the year ago quarter.","Mortgage banking revenues declined to $93 million in the recent quarter, compared with $117 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to an approximate 50-basis-point decline in gain on sale margins, while origination volumes were down about 6%. These downward trends have become evident at the end of last year, although recently, while the competitive environment continues to exert pressure on margins, volumes appeared to have stabilized.","Fee income from deposit services provided were $111 million during the recent quarter compared with $112 million in the linked quarter. Trust and investment revenues were $122 million, up from $117 million in the prior quarter. But particularly encouraging was the strong sales activity we saw in the Wealth Advisory business, which was the primary driver of the linked quarter increase.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $618 million for the first quarter. This compares to $612 million in the fourth quarter.","The seasonal increase in salaries and benefits that I mentioned earlier amounted to $37 million in the recent quarter and included items we typically note, such as accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, higher FICA, higher unemployment insurance expenses and expenses related to the 401(k) match. As in prior years, we would expect a decline in the second quarter as these items return to more normal levels.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses as well as intangible and amortization -- intangible amortization and any merger-related gains and expenses, was 55.9% for the first quarter, improved from 61.1% in last year's first quarter, which also included the seasonal uptick in salaries and benefits expense. That comparable figure was 53.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","So next, let's turn to credits. While credit quality remained strong, we saw an increase in nonaccrual loans. Contributing to the increase was a change in the method of identifying nonaccrual home equity loans and lines of credit to reflect the repayment performance of the related senior lien loans that is not owned by M&T. As discussed in our 10-K, prior to this quarter, we had limited knowledge about the repayment performance for such senior lien loans not owned by M&T. This change had not impacted -- this change had no impact on our allowance for loans.","Nonaccrual loans were 1.60% of total loans at the end of the first quarter compared with 1.52% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter, but down from 1.75% of total loans at the end of the first quarter of last year.","Other nonperforming assets consisting of assets taken in foreclosure or defaulted loans continued to decline, down from $104 million at the end of 2012 to $96 million as of March 31. As has been the case for some time, we expect to report a further decline in our level of criticized assets when we file our 10-Q next month.","Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $37 million, down from $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 23 basis points, down from 27 basis points in the linked quarter. And the provision for credit losses was $37 million for the first quarter compared with $49 million in the linked quarter. The provision very slightly exceeded net charge-offs. And as a result, the allowance for credit losses increased to $927 million as of the end of the first quarter.","The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41%, up from 1.39% at the end of the linked quarter. Both the allowance-to-loan ratio and the nonaccrual loan ratio were impacted by the decline of end-of-period loans as compared with the prior quarter end. The allowance -- the loan loss allowance as of March 31 was 6.2x the annualized net charge-offs for the quarter. We disclose loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from nonaccrual loans because they're deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say there's really low risk of principal loss.","Loans 90 days past due, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at acquisition, were $331 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $312 million, or 94%, are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Loans 90 days past due were $358 million at the end of 2012, of which 88% were guaranteed by government-related entities.","M&T's estimated Tier 1 common capital ratio was 7.39% at the end of March, up 36 basis points from 7.57% at the end of last year.","Lastly, our outlook for legacy M&T, which excludes any impact from the Hudson City merger, is little changed from what we discussed on the January earnings call. The 3 basis points of margin compression and the mid-single-digit loan growth we saw in the first quarter were consistent with that guidance and still reflect what we expect for the remainder of 2013. As I noted earlier, based on what we're seeing today, we're expecting a slow tapering off in the mortgage -- in mortgage banking revenues, especially in comparison to the record levels in the fourth quarter. Having said that, we are encouraged by the recent extension of the HARP program through 2015.","On the expense front, much of the lingering benefits from the Wilmington Trust cost savings as well as other initiatives are being redirected into infrastructure investments, which of course includes our regulatory infrastructure. And I'd also remind you that the high -- seasonally high salary and benefits expense in the first quarter will return to more normal levels in the second quarter.","And with respect to credit, we expect stable to slightly lower charge-offs in 2013 from the levels that we saw in 2012, which are already below what we've considered to be our long-term loss rate. The first quarter results further validate that expectation.","Now turning to the Hudson City transaction. While we can't predict the timing, we remain confident about the economics of the proposed transaction and do not expect material changes to the benefits of the transactions to our net operating earnings in the first full year following the close of the merger. Of course, all these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Jackie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And so just real quick on the BSA update. I guess, thanks for giving us some of that color. I know you can't say much. But as far as the expense base, and I guess your guidance for expenses for the rest of the year, you mentioned you hired a consultant. It looks like on your website you had 5 new postings for some BSA-related employees. I guess should we be thinking about an uptick into the second quarter kind of an expense base related to that BSA issue?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, I think, Brian, the first thing I'd say is we'll clearly make the investments we need to make, and we'll sort of go full steam ahead. I thought that's wonderful you already noticed the postings.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","[Indiscernible].","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Let's see. I think let's put it in context. We have been making quite a bit of investment in our overall infrastructure for some time now. Last year, it was heavily focused on -- the year before, focused on investments in our capital planning exercises, which, of course, affect our technology but our people as well. You saw that we hired Don Truslow as the Chief Risk Officer. You saw that we hired Mahesh Sanakran about a year ago, a little more than year ago, around our forecasting process. So we've been doing a lot on that front anyway. And I guess the way to think about it is, when you think about a over a course of a year, we now spend $2.5 billion. So we have a lot of resources to be able to sort of put to bear. And I just think when you sort of think about earnings models, I think it's kind of hard to find it all in that, right, because we're constantly making investments. The other thing I'd point you to, Brian, is that if you look at -- because there's so much change, we're constantly tweaking our business models. If you look at just the first quarter results over last year, our salaries and benefits are up $10 million, $11 million, $12 million. But that's totally offset by FDIC expense coming down because credit quality is improving and we're issuing the funding and so forth, right? So we're sort of constantly trying to manage the whole. So if I had a line item that said compliance, you'd see that go up and we'd make a lot of investment there, but I'm not sure how to sort of put that in the context of the overall spending.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the expense side. You pointed out the rest of the core cash expenses were down nicely sequentially from the fourth quarter. And you mentioned the FDIC insurance. So it looks like the assessment rate has come down. So should we look at that assessment rate irrespective of the changes in the base, should that continue to work down? It was actually as high as 17 basis points last year's first quarter. It looks like it's closer to 10, 11. And I guess first question, is that a good run rate to go forward? And then that other cost of operations, which was $170 million, was there any sort of credits or adjustments in there that should -- that we should adjust for? Or is that a good run rate going forward?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","So let me do it in reverse. So overall, I mean, typically, we tend to have a lower expense base, and the first quarter tends to be little bit higher other than the salaries in the force [ph]. So that decline is kind of normal. I don't know that it forecasts anything, right? I think if you look at what happened last year from the first to the second, it shouldn't be much different, right? I just tends to be a little low. Then your first part of your question was?","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The FDIC assessment base.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, yes, the FDIC assessment. I think look, the formula is affected by a lot of things. So as classified loans start to continue to come down, you're going to get lower rates there. As we begin -- early on, a year or so ago, we talked about changing some of the way we did business. That's affected that.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Right.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","The issuance of the $800 million has an impact. And so to the extent that as we kind of go out and look at the liquidity coverage ratio and kind of move our -- in that direction, you would logically see some offsets there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Has there been any MOU or a cease-and-desist order or any of the formal written agreement established with the Fed regarding the BSA or the anti-money laundering issue?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","So let me answer. I think so -- okay, so let's step back for a bit. So as you know, the regulatory dialogue that we have by its nature is confidential, as you said. But it's also ongoing. And as -- if you think about how it works as an industry matter, formal enforcement actions are disclosed by the appropriate regulator. While some informal regulatory matters, such as MOUs and so forth, are disclosed by the institution if they're material from a securities law perspective, we didn't wait to receive any formal findings before disclosing this issue last Friday. And as such, we're not really aware of any sort of final outcomes or conclusions from the regulators. We did this in part because of its impact on Hudson City, and we tried to be as proactive as we possibly could. Having said that, we don't believe -- we do believe that we have the full understanding of what the issue is -- issues are to be addressed, and so that's why we're running ahead and working on all of them. And in the end, I guess it will be up to other parties to sort of determine the appropriate sort of type of action that they take. But as I said before, we have never in our minds -- I think this is the first time that I can remember in my 21 years, and as I talk to others, where we've really ever discussed a regulatory matter in public, and it's related to the transaction.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, Ren\u00e9. And just as a follow-up, one of the local newspapers in Buffalo was commenting that some M&T employees were leaving Hudson City branches that were in the process of preparing. Can you confirm if that was true? And if it was, when would these employees be actually going back into the Hudson City branches preparing for the closure?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","So, I mean, what I can say is that each of the institutions kind of have to focus on their own issues. And until you get yourself close to a date and actually close to or having approval, you've got to be very careful to make sure that each institution takes care of their own matters, right? So that's what we'll do. Hudson City will continue to focus on managing its balance sheet and trying to keep themselves safe and sound. And on our front, we're going to focus heavily on this issue and make sure that when the time comes, we're ready.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I know you can't really pinpoint sort of the timing of the Hudson City acquisition. And I forget, the language in the release you all put out Friday said something like a significant delay or a sizable delay. Is it reasonable from a modeling perspective to stick it in the fourth quarter? Or how should we sort of think about the rough timing?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Thanks for your question, Bob. I mean, the thing that we're going to focus on is keeping our regulatory issues as the most important sort of issue, regardless of the transaction. So I got to say that right at the outset, right? And we have every intention that we're going to remediate the issues that are outstanding. And we're going to do so quickly and we're going to do so in a manner that probably exceeds expectations. And second point I'd make to sort of get to where you are is that we need -- to be able to complete the merger, we'll need to obtain the regulatory approval, which, by their nature, are pretty uncertain. And -- but if we can do so, we'll try to get them as soon as possible. But that said, we've not really provided you with a specific date at this time. And I would say that from our perspective, it really seems prudent for us really not to engage in that discussion till maybe later to -- towards the end of the summer when we've made progress on our own things. And at that point, if we have better clarity, we'll do it. But I think internally, we're just going to focus on hitting this one out of the park.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I think previously, the sort of margin assumption around Hudson City was that it would be relatively neutral to M&T's margin. Is that true regardless of the timing of the close because the yields will sort of all be marked to market as long as the yield curve is more or less where it is today?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Based on what I know today, that sounds like it makes a lot of sense. And how -- my understanding of how the 2 institutions are -- I mean, particularly how that institution is hedged. And that gets tweaked a little if you were to see changes in their balance sheet and if you were to see rates move a little. But I think you're thinking about it the right way.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Although changes in their balance sheet won't matter much because you're really only keeping the loan book. I guess you'll have the securities book until it winds down. But mostly, you're just getting loans and deposits, right?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That's correct.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then last question and I'll hop out, and I'll shift direction to loan growth. The loan growth on an end-to-period basis this quarter, as you guys mentioned, was actually down. How much of that do you think was volume being pulled into the fourth quarter ahead of year-end issues? And how much of it do you think is maybe anything else in terms of are you hearing anything different from your lending customers today in terms of their appetite to borrow from where they were in the fourth quarter?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay, yes. I mean, I guess directly to your question, I mean, I think basically, look, you average from the third quarter to the first quarter and you're going to see that a lot of that stuff was timing. And I can't believe that people were -- I mean, we're -- they were changing the timing in the fourth quarter because of the tax events we talked about. But at the end of the day, I think if you look just from the month of -- from February to March, after we saw the drop, we saw the sort of normal mid-single-digit -- low to mid-single-digit loan growth. So I haven't noticed any change. What we -- I mean, I think it's an interesting thing. So in upstate New York, as we talk to people and actually all the way across through Albany, we're seeing that some of the clients are actually -- have more utilization in their lines, that we're hearing stories of people looking to make capital investment, a few capital investments. When you flip all the way down to the other end of the franchise, in Washington D.C., it's more reserved, people are worried about the sequester, the competition has picked up. We were talking 2 quarters about life companies, and we were talking about conduits. Now what we're seeing, and I think it's probably because of the limited, fewer opportunities, that the competition sort of heed up among the large national players that are in that market. So when you look at the overall thing, it's almost a -- I'm kind of laughing at the back of Bob's letter. Middle America seems to be doing very fine, and all of those areas that are affected by specific-type events, right, have gotten more competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In terms of the BSA stuff, can you try to quantify? I mean, when you think about the new people you have to bring on, the new systems that might go in place, what kind of total dollar expenditures do these sort of add to the run rate on an annualized basis?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I mean, this is -- I mean, how do I say this? I mean, look, let me just say it again. We'll make whatever investment it takes. We're not starting from 0, right? So if we do this, we do it pretty well, but we need to make some additional investments. I think the difficult part will be that relative to some other things we've done, I mean, you saw we agreed to bring on the 600 people from -- in the local community here in the mortgage servicing space, right? I mean, those types of things are probably more relevant or so visible, I should say, than maybe hiring of 100 people or whatever the number may be. Really, what you got to think about, though, is on the systems and data side, right? And a lot of those capital investments that you're making, you might not -- they might be significant, but you might not necessarily see them right out of the gate on the -- in the financials, right? They'll come over time. So that would be the one area where you definitely see -- you see spending, but you don't necessarily see the impact being significant in any given quarter. So it's hard to say. I mean, that's basically the best I can do, Ken. As we learn more about it, I'll talk to you about it.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question. In terms of your higher-cost troughs [ph] that you have outstanding, has your thought process changed at all in terms of what you might do with those or when just given the push out of Hudson City?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No, it hasn't changed at all. I don't know that we've said it before, but we can. We do have approval to begin refinancing those out. And I just haven't really thought about when we're going to do it. In part, I think if we saw attractive pricing or something like that, we would probably go ahead and try to seize that opportunity. But we're really focused on decent pricing. So that will probably dictate the timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So a few people have asked me about what, if anything, that BSA\/AML kind of a catch-up means in terms of M&T, broadly speaking? What I mean by that is M&T, which has been a historically above-average-efficiency company and a very conservative company over time, is there anything -- and knowing that the industry is very much getting focused on by the regulators on BSA and AML, so I don't want to read too much of that. But is there anything we should take away here about M&T's investments or degree of investments that the company has been making? I guess the question I'm getting is, are you underinvested in other areas? And is that part of what's happening on the BSA\/AML side?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","One of the things that, Ken, is -- let's step back and think about what's unique. We were engaged in 3, 4 or 5 transactions through the crisis when most people weren't. And so what I think is confusing is when you look at the numbers, it looks like the expenses have been well controlled. But what you're seeing there is all of the synergies in -- from the mergers of -- the transaction have gone right back into building the infrastructure. So I already talked about the hiring of people. If you sort of looked underneath that, that's been continuing. But we've put in new data centers, one down in Hillsboro, Delaware last year. We spent $20 million on our way to a $43 million spend. On the one up in Amherst, another new data center, we've been involved in the building out our capital planning process and our compliance structure. We hired a new Chief Compliance Officer about 1.5 years or so ago. So I don't know if you've really noticed when you're looking at the numbers, but really a significant investment has been made. And so as we look at this, we kind of see it the same way because at the end of the day, you can't be a strong institution unless you're -- unless you've made these investments for the future. So I don't really look at this as a sort of short-term thing. I think we're going to take our time. We'll do this right. We'll exceed expectations because we tend to be sort of here for the long term, right? And the other thing I will say is that if you look back, there have been 3 periods of expansion for M&T: in the early '90s, at the turn of the century and then recently. And all 3 of those periods came to us because we were healthy and the industry was not. And what we did in the interim is we built up our infrastructure. So that's kind of what you're seeing today. I think we do it pretty well, and I don't think this is a sign of anything that's changing in our operating model.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's important color, Ren\u00e9. And my -- just I have one follow-up on the timing of the deal. Can you just walk us through what the path is from here? I know it's going to be hard to say about when it is you go back to the Fed or they come back to you and then when you start to put the merger process on -- back en route. But can you just walk us through what benchmarks -- how we can understand, what has to happen between now and closing and how that's now changed, what are the differences there?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Sure, I'll say it again, Ken. We do not take regulatory approvals for granted. That's what we have to work our way through. The significant issue that you have to get through is you've got to put in place your infrastructure on BSA\/AML, and you got to do it to meet the standards of the firm, the board and the regulators. So that's what we're doing.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. I'm just wondering more of like is there a path? So is that -- does that just imply then there's a period of time where you put your work in, there's a period of time where you ask if it's okay, there's a period of time where they tell you it's okay and then we move back on to just normal last-mile approvals? I think that's what people are just trying to understand, is what needs to -- what back-and-forth needs to happen between you and the regulators in order to get to that point, rather than trying to again perfectly gain like when that time is actually going to be.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","That -- I mean, how do I say this? That is just a hard question to answer. I think what you're requiring me to do is put your head down and make sure everything is in place. Our examiners, each one of them, who are from different places, are here all the time. They're continuously monitoring us. And so we feel that if we do our work, then the rest will take care of itself. But in terms of talking about timing, you just can't do it.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That -- that's I understand. And my last question, Ren\u00e9, is just on the mortgage business, can you just give us a little color on -- you mentioned that originations had stabilized. But can you give us an understanding of what the pipeline looked like at the end of the quarter and what your commitments to originate were?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Yes, sure. So let me just do the pipeline a bit. So we had just about 1 point -- just under $1.9 billion in our pipeline going into the -- at the end of fourth quarter. And that's now $1.6 billion, $1.64 billion. So it's down 12%, 13%. And if you look at what we locked, we were at $2 billion, and this quarter we were $1.9 billion. So that came down 6%. So it's a little lower. And as I said, I think we saw things drop significantly by the time we got to December and then January. But it seemed relatively stable as we kind of went through the 3 months of the quarter. So I don't think we're seeing any kind of an acceleration from where we were in lower volume. Although we would expect that over the next few quarters, that will be the trend, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess coming back to the question of Hudson City and the ability to do any of kind of the initiatives you had planned for accretion and cost savings and stuff like that. I mean, I guess one of the things that strikes me is some of the stuff Hudson City was thinking about doing as a stand-alone entity before the merger and some of the things you had planned for post-merger accretion initiatives are overlapping initiatives. And so, I guess, should we just expect Hudson City to run on a status quo basis? Or is there some subset of things like expanding into agency mortgage origination or maybe a start on the branch rationalization that they could do because then, even in a scenario, unlikely scenario where they end up being a stand-alone entity, they arguably would have done those things anyway?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Okay. So I can't -- Brian, I can't comment on specifics because Hudson City is going to have to go down their path and run their institution. But having said that, there's a number of things before we showed up that they were trying to do that would strengthen their franchise and that would change the mix of business they have on their balance sheet that are very consistent with things that we would do if we were operating in New Jersey. And one of the benefits of the transaction is that we were able to accelerate that, but they were very much aligned. And so when I look at the whole thing, if there's a delay or significant delay in the transaction, I don't see much of the changes in the economics. I mean, it's very small things. Like obviously, there'll be no benefit until Hudson City either significantly improves their -- or either significantly changes their operating model or does the merger with M&T before you'd see lower FDIC expenses, right? And in this case, that was a large item. So that'll just be delayed. But I think the way you've characterized this is right, but it's very important to understand that we don't have any influence over that whatsoever.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","What about -- can you remind us what percentage of your mortgage originations are HARP related?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, it was about 26% this quarter.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, pretty much unchanged from last quarter or...","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","It was like 30%. It was -- it might have been 30% last quarter. I'll get that number for you in a minute.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Ren\u00e9, I know you commented on sort of in the past what new origination yields sort of are in the ballpark, I know. Maybe if you could comment where those are relative to some of your overall average loan yield that was, I think, 424 basis points for the first quarter.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, you're -- I'm sorry, I was back on mortgage. So you're saying what's going on with loan yields?","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just new origination yields sort of relative to the current book, which is 424.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, yes. Yes, it's interesting. So last quarter, we talked about it a little bit, and I said that we hadn't seen much change in the competitive pressure. And we heard more comments across our footprint about competitive pressure this time. So I grab this chart, which actually, I think, I got in front of me. And really, what you see is there really has been a steady, downward pressure on margins probably for 6 quarters. It's been slight, so you don't really noticed it. But I would say that we're running now at levels that we hadn't really seen since maybe the fourth quarter of 2010 because it's kind of been very gradual. And I think what you're seeing there -- so now, first, having said that, it's still much, much higher, the spreads to LIBOR, from where we were than before we went into the crisis and all that, right? So they're still relatively healthy. But having said that, I think what you're seeing is that there are limited opportunities. Whether people should be thinking about it this way or not, they are thinking that they have a lot of capital, right, and they're trying to find something to do with it when the economy really hasn't moved that much, and it's creating a fair amount of competitive pressure and particularly in those customers who are very, very healthy, right? Everybody wants the same individual. So when you look at the trends, I would say that it's just coming down slightly. Maybe it's dropping 2, 3, 4 basis points a quarter, right? But there's -- clearly, you can see the pressure.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","I know, I guess really the yield dilution or yield pressure, a lot of it has really been on the securities book. And I seem to remember new originations were sort of coming on close to where the average loan book is. So what's your -- where is the number sort of relative to the 424? Is it sub-4%? I guess if you're assuming 2 or 3 basis points a quarter, I guess that's what you would apply.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Some I'll throw some numbers out there just as a rough reference, right? And I don't think about loan yields that way. I think about them as a spread to LIBOR. So if we're running up at 300 basis points now, 18 months ago that might have been 320. And that 300 basis points is kind of consistent what we were in 2010, but we might have been at 400 back in middle of '09, right? So -- and you kind of think that steady progression. Having said that, we were 200 or right around 200 and trying to hold our ground, which is why our industry loan growth was low, maybe 190, back in '07, right? So we're still about 100 basis points higher than that. And then -- and so that's good news. But in terms of what you're thinking about the rollover of the balance sheet,  you got some downward pressure there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had 3 questions for you. How much traction are you still feel out in the marketplace with the HSBC branch sales and the disruption of the customers? A lot of those in-market acquisitions that go to somebody else create a pretty substantial market share gain, so I just was curious if you still felt like there was some momentum there.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, I think -- again, I guess the best indication was Western New York, again, had our best loan growth. So I think we said we had 5%. I think it was 11% loan growth in Upstate New York on average this quarter. And while I would expect some of that to begin to taper off because a lot of the activities that -- the significant activity that took place last quarter. Marty, I don't know if you'll appreciate this, but as I live here in Western New York and I go to dinner parties, people -- every time I say I'm from M&T, people still come up and say, \"I need to switch to your bank.\" So I think there's a lot of momentum.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. [Indiscernible].","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","But I wouldn't expect it to be as strong as what we saw last year.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And then BSA and AML are long-standing requirements. And as you pointed out, you really don't have a lot of international activity and complex businesses. And the acquisition of Hudson City really doesn't add to that exposure as well, so not specifically in that area. How do you -- is it just the size, so your size of the organization, that kind of puts you on a threshold? Because this isn't the first review you've had of these requirements. They've been out there for quite a while.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","I think, Marty, that what you're seeing is that in this environment, there's a lot of change and you've got to continuously make improvements and investments. And you've got to go above and beyond to make sure that you're ahead of the curve. And you can't -- you just can't step back. You've got to keep making investments. A huge change is going on in the industry. And it's not a matter of sort of saying, well, I was okay last year, so I'll be okay this year. You've got to make those investments. And I think in our case, it's a little bit exacerbated by the fact that we're a bigger firm.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","There's no signs before in reviews or anything like that that there was imminent issue?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes, you -- well, Marty, you've been on my team. I guess I'll leave it at that.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","We'll go on to the next question. Any change in your balance sheet perspective for the positioning? Since Hudson City was only going to balance the balance sheet and kind of use some of your asset sensitivity, any change in your perspective with the delay? That was the last thing I wanted to ask. And thanks for humoring me on some of my questions there.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No change at all. We don't see any change at all. I think we're just -- we'll keep -- as we said in our outlook. But there's no restructurings or anything. Or if we're working on anything where, as you saw with the issuance of unsecured debt, we're sort of steadily working our way to make sure that we have the appropriate liquidity and so forth. And we will -- I wouldn't be surprised to see a few more of that type of thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ebrahim on behalf of Erika. I had a quick clarification to Brian's question earlier on the other expense line item. Did you say we should expect that $170 million to sort of trend back higher to sort of where it's been in the second half of last year, like the first quarter is seasonally low and it goes back up?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Yes. Usually, there's a seasonal dip in that, and I can't explain exactly why right off the top of my head. But in terms of professional services and those types of things, they tend to be light in the first quarter, and I think that was the case this quarter. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a little uptick there. Put it this way. Our -- in the past, going from the first quarter to second quarter, you don't get the full benefit of the change in the salary and benefit swing.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Good, okay. And I guess just one question with regards to the Hudson City deal. Does that change in terms of your hiring plans in the New York area with regards to commercial bankers, like that deal will reduce the rate of hiring? Or how does that impact the thought process there?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","No, I don't think so at all. I mean, I think -- remember, the thing to think about it, which people tend to forget about, is that we're already there. And so we've hired quality people. And if we find -- we continue to find quality folks who we think can add to our franchise, then we would continue to hire them. But it -- you will almost again think of that as a little bit separate from the transaction. I know we accelerated everything because of it, but I think quality people are always welcome here.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Steven Palestri [ph], a private investor.","Unknown Shareholder","This is Gap Lester [ph], Ren\u00e9. I'm concerned where the new shares are coming from that you're going to be issuing to HCBK shareholders.","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Could you just repeat that question again? You're just a little -- your voice was a little light on the call.","Unknown Shareholder","Sure. I'm concerned where the new shares are going to be coming from, that you will have to be issuing HCBK shareholders. Are you issuing new shares and will that dilute the current shares of M&T?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Now so the proposal of -- as the agreement we entered into specifies, is that we would be issuing shares of M&T to the Hudson City shareholders. 60% of the consideration would be in shares, and the remainder would be in cash. And because they would be issued in conjunction with the -- a positive economic transaction, there would be no dilution.","Unknown Shareholder","But are those shares currently in circulation only held by M&T so that they're -- you're just not loading more shares to the [indiscernible] of shares?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Well, what would happen is those shares, part of the shares would be exchanged for the Hudson City shares. And in return, we would get the capital that sits on Hudson City's books today.","Unknown Shareholder","Okay, so there's no dilution of the current shares of M&T?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Not as we projected.","Operator","You do have a question from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Adam Chaim - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Adam Chaim in for Matt O'Connor. I just had a follow-up on the balance sheet management question ahead of HCBK. Sorry if this has already been asked, but you started selling almost all your residential mortgage production late last year, I think, partially given anticipation of Hudson City closing. So I think you said earlier that your balance sheet management wouldn't change ahead of this given the delay. So this doesn't change your thought process in terms of holding more of that until the deal is actually closed? The transaction [ph]?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","We don't have any change in thought process from where I was in January. So I don't plan to do -- we don't plan to do anything different.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Gary Lu with First Investors.","Gary Lu","So Ren\u00e9, so if the timing of the regulatory issue is so difficult to predict, can you talk about your thoughts behind putting out a January 2014 time line in the press release? And also, the second question is, assume we are in January 2014 and you still haven't received the approval. Do you intend to maybe extend the deadline a little bit? Or do you really want to walk away from the deal?","Ren\u00e9 F. Jones","Oh, that's a lot of questions. I think it's tough to say that. But think about it this way. In banking and in regulated -- definitely in regulated industries, it's not unusual, first, for shareholder approvals to be obtained prior to getting any kind of a regulatory approval, right? So that is not unusual at all. And I think if you kind of go back and look at what we've been talking about for the past 7 months in investor conferences in our original deck, this transaction is unique and adds a lot of value to both sides. So our thought process was -- our thought process when sitting down with the Hudson City folks is that we all remain really committed to the transaction because it adds so much value and it improves both financial institutions. So -- and I don't -- I think at the end of the day, not much else to say about that. I mean, you can see it in the market's reaction. Everybody gets this transaction, makes a lot of sense, and so we're very committed to it. So we thought we would extend the time line, give ourselves a little bit more time to get our issues resolved and move on.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions.","Donald J.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Maria, and good morning. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. M&T's results for the second quarter represent a continuation of the trends that we've been seeing for the past several quarters. These include, continued growth in net interest income, which was up nearly 8% compared with the last year's second quarter, expenses that remain well controlled, not withstanding the steps we\u2019re taking to redirect savings from the lower tax rate and the higher compensation for certain employees, a credit environment that remain stable with further decline in non-accrual loans and the net charge-off ratio at just 16 basis points for the quarter.","These factors, combined with the impact from capital distributions, consistent with our 2017 CCAR Capital Plan and subsequent resubmissions have led to continued improvement in our returns on both assets and common equity.","As announced in late June, M&T's revised capital plan for the 2018 CCAR cycle received no objections from the Federal Reserve. The plan includes 25% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $1 per share, which will be considered by the board this quarter.","The plan also calls for $1.8 billion of common stock repurchases to be completed over the fourth quarter period that began July 1st. The board's stock repurchase authorization record [to implement the buyback plan was announced by means of an 8-K filing yesterday.","Now let's take a look at the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share was $3.26 for the second quarter of 2018, improved significantly from $2.23 in the first quarter of 2018 and $2.35 in the second quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $493 million, also up sharply from $353 million in the linked quarter and $381 million in the year ago quarter.","On a GAAP basis, M&T's second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.7%, and an annualized return on average common equity of 13.32%. This compares with rates of 1.22% and 9.15% respectively, in the previous quarter.","Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $5 million or $0.03 per common share, little change from the prior quarter.","Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.","M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization was $498 million, up from $357 million in the linked quarter and $386 million in last year's second quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.29 for the recent quarter, up from $2.26 in 2018's first quarter and $2.38 in the second quarter of 2017.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.79% and 19.91% for the recent quarter.","The comparable returns were 1.28% and 13.51% in the first quarter of 2017 \u2013 2018, excuse me. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","As a reminder, the year-over-year comparisons for both GAAP and net operating earnings were impacted by the reduction in Federal income tax rates for 2018 and beyond with M&T's current effective tax rate some 11 percentage points lower in 2017. GAAP pretax income in the recent quarter improved by 10% from the year ago quarter, while pretax net operating income improved by 9%.","Recall that both GAAP and net operating earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were impacted by certain noteworthy items. During the first quarter, M&T increased its reserve for litigation matters by $135 million to reflect the anticipated settlement of the Wilmington Trust Corporation shareholder litigation. That increase on an after-tax basis reduced net income by $102 million or $0.68 of diluted earnings per common share.","Also, during the first quarter of 2018, M&T received income of $23 million from Bayview Lending Group, which was included in other revenues from operations. This amounted to $17 million after tax effect or $0.12 per diluted common share.","M&T's results for the first quarter also included a $9 million tax benefit related to accounting guidance for equity compensation. That amounted to $0.06 per diluted common share, while reducing the effective tax rate for the first quarter to 22.99%.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.01 billion in the second quarter of 2018, up $34 million from previous quarter.","The comparison with the prior quarter reflects an expansion of the net interest margin to 3.83%, up 12 basis points from 3.71% in the linked quarter, combined with the impact from one additional accrual day in the recent quarter.","The primary driver of the wider net interest margin was to further increases in short term interest rates arising from the Fed in March and June rate actions. On top of that, one month LIBOR, the index to which a majority of our commercial loans are tied has maintained a wider than normal spread to the Fed funds target rate, and that wider spread persisted for a longer period than was the case last quarter.","In addition, we continue to experience less deposit pricing reactivity than we have been modeling. We estimate these factors added the benefit to the net interest margin of as much as 12 basis points in 2018 second quarter. Other very modest positive factors were offset by the impact from the additional day linked [ph] quarter compared to the first quarter.","Average loans declined by $360 million or less than 1% compared to the previous quarter. The largest factor in the decline is the continued runoff of the Hudson City mortgage loan portfolio. Putting that aside, other loan categories grew less than 1% in the aggregate.","Looking at loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were up slightly about 1% compared with the linked quarter driven by growth in floor plan balances.","Paydowns by commercial customer continue to be headwind. Commercial real estate loans were effectively flat compared with the first quarter. As noted, residential real estate loans, which are largely comprised of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City transaction, continued the expected pace of paydowns. The portfolio declined by some 3% or approximately 13% annualized, consistent with previous quarters.","Consumer loans were up less than 1%. Seasonal strength in recreation finance loans were offset by a slight decline in direct auto loans and the continuation of the long-term trend of declines in home equity lines and loans.","Regionally, we're continuing to see good loan growth in New Jersey, where we are still building out our commercial banking franchise from what was Hudson City's historical thrift business model.","Area surrounding New Jersey, including New York City, Philadelphia and Cherrytown, which in the aggregate comprise our metro region were another area of relative strength.","Average earnings assets declined by about 1% or slightly over $1 billion, which includes the $360 million decline in average loans. Average investment securities declined by $610 million, reflecting our preference to place cash flows received from maturities and MBS principal amortization at the Fed, rather than reinvest into securities in the current rate environment.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, CDs over $250,000 and brokered deposits declined an estimated 1% compared with the first quarter. This primarily reflects a loss of commercial escrow deposits \u2013 deposits, excuse me, which we noted on the April call.","In addition, we're seeing some flows of non-maturity deposits in the time accounts, which we would expect at this point in the interest rate cycle and we\u2019re having increasing discussions with our commercial customers about optimizing our cash balances.","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $457 million in the second quarter compared with $459 million in the prior quarter. As noted, the first quarter included $23 million of income from Bayview Lending Group.","Mortgage banking revenues were $92 million in the recent quarter compared with $87 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $644 million in the quarter, up about 3% from the first quarter.","Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities were $61 million, essentially flat compared to the prior quarter.","Commercial banking \u2013 sorry, commercial mortgage banking revenues were $31 million in the second quarter compared with $26 million in the linked quarter, reflecting increased to origination activity.","Trust income was $138 million in the recent quarter, up from $131 million in the previous quarter, and 9% above the $127 million in last year's second quarter. Results from the recent quarter and the year-ago quarter, both include some $4 million seasonal fees earned for assisting clients in preparation of their tax returns.","Service charges loan deposits were $107 million, improved from the $105 million in the first quarter. Gains on investment securities were $2 million in the recent quarter compared with the $9 million loss in the first quarter. This volatility comes as a result of changes in the fair value of our GSE preferred stock, which prior to 2018 had been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.","Included in other revenues are certain categories of commercial loan fees, including letter of credit and loans indication fees, which remained somewhat subdued in line with the current commercial lending environment.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were $770 million, down from $927 million from the previous quarter. As noted, the first quarter's operating expenses included the $135 million addition to the litigation reserve for the Wilmington Trust Corporation litigation matter.","Salaries and benefits declined by $45 million to $419 million, reflecting a return to more normal levels from the seasonally high levels in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these are the initial actions we've taken to deploy some of the savings from lower tax rates into higher wages for certain employees. This program won't reach his full run rate until the fourth quarter.","Excluding last quarter's addition to litigation reserve, other cost of operations increased by approximately $20 million, which includes higher advertising expense, as well as the cost of legal services arising from the Wilmington Trust litigation.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator was 52.4% in the recent quarter. That ratio was 64% in the previous quarter and 52.7% in 2017 second quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Credit quality continues to be in line or even slightly better than our expectations. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 16 basis points for the second quarter, down slightly from 19 basis points in the first quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $35 million in the recent quarter, which matched net charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses was unchanged at $1.02 billion at the end of June. The ratio of allowance to total loans was also unchanged at 1.16%.","Non-accrual loans were $820 million at June 30th, down from $865 million at the end of the first quarter. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans fell by 6 basis points, ending the quarter at 0.93%.","Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were $223 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $202 million or 91% were guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.52% compared with 10.59% at the end of the first quarter, reflecting strong earnings retention during the second quarter net of share repurchases and the impact from the end of period of changed in risk weighted assets. During the second quarter, M&T repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $475 million.","Turning to the outlook. Based on second quarter results, our thoughts for 2018 remained largely in line with what we shared on both the January and April conference calls.","To reiterate those thoughts, we had previously signaled that we expect the lending environment for 2018 overall to look much like 2017, with growth in total loans ranging from flat to low single digit pace. We currently believe that loan growth for 2018 will be at the lower end of that range. I'll remind you that the third quarter usually reflects seasonal low balances for dealer floor plan customers.","The net interest margin has widened from the December, March and June actions by the Fed, and the market is expecting one to two additional actions over the remainder of 2018.","Based on the current level of interest rates and reflecting the impact of the interest rates hedges we entered into last year, we continue to estimate that a hypothetical future 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates should result in a 5 to 8 basis point benefit to the net interest margin.","This also embeds a series of assumptions on resultant deposit pricing reactivity for various deposit categories. So far, deposit pricing reactivity continues to be lower than what we have modeled. Based on those balance and margin assumptions, we expect somewhat better year-over-year growth in net interest income, perhaps beyond a mid single digit range.","Residential mortgage banking activity held up somewhat better than expected with origination volumes helped by the summer selling people. We continue to expect additional improvements in commercial mortgage banking revenues as the year progresses, although we are seeing some pressure on margins there.","The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remained little changed, we continue to expect growth in the low to mid single digit range. Excluding the first quarter's $135 million addition to the reserve for the Wilmington Trust Corporation shareholder litigation, we continue to expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2018 compared to last year.","As noted, the wage adjustments tied to the reduction taxes will reach the new run rate by the end of the year. Our outlook for credit also remains little changed. There are no apparent significant pressures on particular geographies or industries.","As to capital, as I noted at the start of the call, we expect to begin executing the 2018 capital plan. Our estimated 10.52% CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter is still in excess of where we believe is necessary to safely operate the bank over the long-term there is room to continue to bring that ratio down.","Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth; changes in interest rates; political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Maria will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Darren King","Morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Darren, I was hoping you could talk more about the comment you made, do you guys are having more discussions, I got this right, but more discussions with companies about their excess cash. I mean, does that imply that we should start to see a more meaningful reduction in the non-interest bearing deposits going forward? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So by having those conversations Ken, we're looking at the total balances that our commercial customers have. As interest rates go up, we'll see some movement in earnings credit rates, which means that the excess balances that they have available to them they are looking to invest. I think we'll see those balances go primarily in one or two places. One will be in the sweep products, which could be on or off balance sheet sweeps. And the other place you'll see that go and we're seeing some equity is actually into interest-bearing commercial checking accounts, which are now an available option after the repeal Reg Q during the crisis.","So some pieces we're seeing stay on balance sheet with changes to rates and earnings credit rates. And in other cases, it's moving in to other interest bearing categories, some on balance sheet, some off.","So we probably see a little bit of movement there. We saw a little bit in the second quarter, which is really seasonal. We tend to see commercial balances peak in the fourth and first quarters as they prepare to make distributions and pay taxes.","Those balances tend to come down in the second quarter and then start to build back up in the third and fourth. So we'll see a little bit of those two effects counterbalance each other as we go forward through the year.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. And just aside from the balance changes, if we can't tie into the deposit sort of competition or deposit costs, obviously your deposit base seem very low this quarter.","Darren King","Yeah\u2026","Ken Zerbe","But given those discussions that you're having, given that from several other banks we've heard talk about sort of increased deposit competition and their need to increase their deposit cost to stay competitive.","I mean, does that - it seems that your NIM expectations are fairly unchanged in terms of the benefit of the 25 basis point rate hike, but can you just tie that, that sort of those expectations in with this presumed expectation that from here it sounds like you're going to have a little more increased pressure on your deposit costs?","Darren King","Sure. So I think there is a number of factors to consider when going through our balance sheet, Ken. First, we have the run-off in the Hudson City mortgage portfolio. And that right away creates unfortunately $400 million or $500 million a quarter balances that are already funded. So that gives us a little bit of a help on deposit pricing.","Obviously, the deposit relationships are important to us and we'll be competitive on those, and we operate in an environment that is one that is competitive and we'll match what our competition is doing there.","And then we also have the Hudson City time deposit portfolio that continues to run down. And as rates have come up, particularly in the CD space, what's rolling off there is almost price to - what the roll on margins are. So we have the benefit of those not actually pricing up.","So for some of the legacy customers who have lower priced money market accounts, we'll see some of those moving into time accounts, which will put some upward pressure on interest costs. Obviously, the conversation that we just had about commercial customers will put a little bit of upward pressure on deposit costs, but we do have some other offsets, which I think, keep us maybe a little bit below where the industry has been.","But I think the pace that we have been on, which was pretty close to zero, I think we're probably past that and we'll start to see a little bit more reactivity in deposit pricing as we go forward. And that's really the five to eight basis points change that we've been talking about, we've just been running above that so far, probably because that the assets are repriced higher, faster than fed funds. And so far, deposit pricing has been a little bit lower than we expected. So that's where we're still comfortable with that range, and hopefully that makes sense.","Ken Zerbe","It does. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Darren King","Morning, John.","John Pancari","On the - just more specifically on the second quarter margin. Given your commentary around the benefit to the margin this quarter, is there anything about the quarterly progression in the margin in the second quarter that could revert at all to the downtime next quarter, given those factors that you flagged?","Darren King","Yes. The biggest thing to keep in mind there, John is the LIBOR, right? And the assets, the vast majority of our assets are priced off of one month LIBOR, and for the longest - well, for a lot of this year and in particular, in the second quarter, LIBOR ran well in advance of fed funds.","And so as fed funds catches up to LIBOR or vice versa, that will put pressure on the asset yield. But as long as the fed funds that comes up, then there shouldn't be any problem when this LIBOR comes down and makes a little bit of movement down on the yield on those assets, which might put a little bit of pressure on the margin.","But nothing that would take us outside of that range that we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters.","John Pancari","Okay. And that goes for the loan yields as well, that 22 basis point increase linked quarter, same thing, not really outsized there?","Darren King","Yes, that's right.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then separately, in terms of the balance sheet moves, I know you mentioned the ongoing runoff of the acquired Hudson City resi mortgage portfolio. How much incremental runoff do you expect here? Any change in the expected pace of runoff that you see?","Darren King","We've been running pretty much at this pace for the last couple of years. And the vast majority that drives that is the normal amortization and paydown activity as opposed to prepayment speed.","So our expectation is that we'll continue to run 12% to 13% annualized run down in that portfolio. But don't forget the dollar amount that runs off will continue to shrink as the portfolio gets smaller.","John Pancari","Got it. And the dollar amount that ran off this quarter was what?","Darren King","Was just about $600 million.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s it from me., Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey. Good morning, Darren.","Darren King","Morning, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Just to start to follow-up on the deposit conversation, given how much you guys have lagged, are starting to see one higher pace pricing as you're having conversations with those commercial customers. And two, are you seeing more widespread pressure just to increase deposit rates across the board that we've seen some other banks to recently?","Darren King","I think when we look at our deposit portfolio and what's going on, it's very customer-specific and somewhat nuanced. So for balances that are municipal deposits, and some of them are mortgage escrows that we talked about, those have generally been tied to fed funds or some market level and have always moved pretty much 100% reactive with those changes, and in some cases might have been more.","And when we talk about those commercial mortgage escrow balances that ran off, they were fairly richly priced, and we can replace them for an equal spread, maybe even slightly less, which is why we're okay with that.","When you get to some of the commercial customers as rates are moving up, as we mentioned, we're seeing more attention being paid to how those balances are earning a return for corporate customers and treasurers.","And obviously, we continue to see larger balanced customers, notably wealth and private banking types of customers very focused on the return they're getting. And those prices have been moving, and I would describe us as pretty much in lockstep with where the market is going.","When you get to a more consumer type of balances, we obviously, we've had that Hudson City time deposit, which really helped us manage the total cost of deposits over the course of the last, I would say, 18 months. And we're at a point now where those 2 rate curves have started to cross, if you will.","With the Hudson City rates coming down and the non-Hudson City rates going up, kind of matched each other. And so we'll stop seeing a decrease in Hudson City, but we don't expect to see a massive increase.","Most of our action in the consumer portfolio has really been in time accounts. And for us and I think pretty much the industry, the consumer still tends to be short in how they are managing their interest rate that they are earning. Mainly because once you get past two years on the CD rates, the incremental earnings you're getting don't really compensate the tieing up your money for the incremental time, and so most of the action has been 2 years and below, really around 1 year. And when we look at our money market rates, our rates are very competitive with those in our markets.","So as mentioned before, I think, we'll start to see a little bit more, but consistent move up in deposit pricing as we go through the rest of the year and into next year. But when we look at the path that we're on and what's happening in the market, we don't foresee a massive spike in one or two quarters. It will be more consistent through time.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. If I can ask you one separate question. Look at C&I loan growth balances, they are basically down over the past year. We think about what business confidence has done, the economy has been really well, you have tax benefits. Just want a big picture of you, why are you not seeing stronger C&I loan growth here?","Darren King","So Steve, it's a great question. It is - really there's two trends that are going on underneath that are a little bit masking each other. When we look at our origination activity, both last year and this year in the first half, well, in 2017 we were down in originations from '16, but '16 was a blockbuster year.","2018 over '17 is up about 6% to 8% in terms of our originations. What we've seen, and we saw at the back half of '17 and we've seen again in '18 is just an increased level of paydowns and payoffs. And in the C&I space, when we look underneath that what's going on, the vast majority of it is driven by merger and acquisition activity, sometimes facilitated by private equity, sometimes not.","But as customers who are selling their business entirely or selling parts of their business and then taking those proceeds and paying down their loans. So the optimism in the economy does seem to be there, albeit maybe not quite as great it was in 2016, but '18 is better than '17. It's just being masked a little bit by some of the other things that are happening in the economy with the M&A activity.","Steven Alexopoulos","Got you. Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thanks, Darry.","Darren King","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Darren King","Morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","I'm just looking loan-to-deposit ratio has increased 98% now. Just wondering what your thoughts on deposit growth going forward?","Darren King","Well, the loan-to-deposit ratio obviously is a measure that we pay a lot of attention to. I'll say again, that one thing that helps the loan-to-deposit ratio is the Hudson City mortgages that runoff, right? So those create room to replace them with commercial loans, either real estate or C&I without affecting the loan-to-deposit ratio.","And then obviously, we're paying attention to our deposit book, watching how customers are moving balances between categories and looking at other categories that we can grow in, things such as brokered money market and brokered CDs is another place where we can help manage that one.","It's certainly, something that we pay attention to, and we'll be watching through time. And obviously, we'll be paying attention to both sides of the balance sheet, both the loan and our deposits.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just a follow-up [indiscernible] question, but you updated the guidance on the loans coming in more at the lower end of that flat to low single digit. But is there a risk that loans could decline just given you've got that seasonality in the third quarter?","Darren King","I guess, when you look at both, I guess, think about the back half of the year. There is potential for a little bit of a decline in the third quarter on an average basis, just because of the auto dealer loans, but fourth quarter is usually pretty strong, and we tend to see big upticks in the fourth quarter and those two should cancel themselves out.","Now where June ended was pretty decent, and so far it seems to be holding up into the third quarter. So it's way too early to declare victory there, but it's off to a good start. And then really the wildcard that we've been signaling for the last few quarters is just the rate of paydowns and payoffs.","And that's really hard to predict, and that would be the risk to seeing that -- to seeing some average decline. But we feel good because the pipeline that we ended the second quarter was equal to or slightly better than where we ended the first quarter. So I see a couple of pros and cons.","I guess, we've been signaling this kind of balance sheet growth really since December. And we still feel pretty good about it. There's nothing that I see where I envision us being 3% or 4% growth. But in the current period I don't see 3% or 4% decline either, I think we should be right around that flat to slightly up range.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks, Darren.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, Darren.","Darren King","Morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you carve out for us, if you could take only kind of special issues that you have, and you talked about Hudson City portfolio and then the escrow deposits and stuff? So if you just kind of take those away, what was the core deposit and loan growth on a year-over-year basis would you estimate for you guys this quarter?","Darren King","So if you take out the Hudson City runoff and you look at all the other loan categories, the average asset - the average loan growth was probably about half to 1%. And if you look at deposits and you factor out the Hudson City runoff, which is a little bit lower, probably deposit growth was flat to down half a percent mainly due to those commercial mortgage escrow balances that we talked about. So those were couple of large things.","Underlying trends, when we look at our consumer accounts and consumer growth, it's pretty steady. You will notice in the other costs that some of those expenses were up, and some increased advertising, which is driving some increased volume in consumers, which doesn't translate immediately into balances, but will generate balances through time as well as fees as those customers activate their debit cards and credit cards and start using them.","And solid growth in our small business customer base, which is one of our core strengths. And then continued movement in commercial customers, we'll just see as we talked about through time probably a slightly different profile of their balances as the mix between what stays in operating accounts or DDA versus what goes into an interest checking versus what goes into sweep. I think we'll start to see some shifts as we go forward.","But underlying core, when we talk just about customers and the balance sheet, we feel really good about where things are.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then you guys have been very successful in years past in making acquisitions. I recognize they are episodic, and recognize that you guys tend to be more of a, I don't want to say distressed buyer, but you certainly don't get involved in auctions.","Can you just give us an outlook of what you're seeing on an M&A front? Has your views changed on mergers and acquisitions now that RenA [ph] is at the helm? And just maybe an update of that outlook?","Darren King","Sure. Well, RenA [ph] is at the helm now, but certainly, an architect of all of the acquisitions we've done in the past. So I'm pretty positive that the stock process can change as the title change.","But our thoughts on acquisitions haven't really changed Gerard, and that we always start with the returns. And in fact that's pretty much how we think about the bank and our shareholders capital. And we think about returns when we're investing in loans, when we're investing in technology, when we're investing in other institutions, and that's really the primary driver.","And if we think there's a combination that makes sense, where we can create value for both sets of shareholders and we've got willing [ph] seller, then we're interested in talking to those folks.","What seems to be the case in banking right now is everyone wants to be a buyer and no one wants to be a seller. So I think there is lots of interest in partnerships, but I think everyone thinking that they are the buyer and not the seller. And I think that's why you're seeing some slower activity than you might expect given some of the changes that have come out recently with the regulations.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey. Good morning, guys, a couple of questions, just some follow-ups on the commercial environment. Darren, any sense at all that trade friction, geopolitics is hitting sentiment from some of your - hitting sentiment for some of your commercial clients, even those who aren't necessarily involved there in international trade?","Darren King","I think the short answer is, yes. I think anytime the environment, there is uncertainty in it. It just causes a little bit of inactivity and paralysis. But it's not widespread. It's depending on who really is impacted by those changes. Many of our customers, given our geographies, do trade across borders and can be impacted by, but in different ways depending on whether their imports are finished goods or raw material.","And then obviously, there is many of our customers who aren't directly impacted by, but could be because of big employers in the economy where they operate. It's certainly something that's on their mind from our discussions with the customers. I wouldn't say it's overwhelming them, and that they are obsessing about it.","But it's just the next thing that's on the back of their mind as they think about their business. And for us, the best thing that can happen in any of these environments is just that we have some period of stable certainty or at least as close to as we can get, so people can focus on their business.","Saul Martinez","And what -- I mean, is it -- do you think it's impacting utilization rates or anything like that? Or is it just sort of not top of mind, but something that folks should be thinking about?","Darren King","I think it's not top of mind, but definitely on their mind. And again, I think it varies. I would say, we've definitely seen some slight upticks in utilization this year, and we tend to see people focus as much or more on borrowing or working capital, and for M&A types of things as opposed to for CapEx. We have seen a slight increase in CapEx, but really when we look at where the activity is, that's not the place where we've seen it so far.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Got it. And I think just switch gears a little bit, I think, in the past you've been a bit skeptical of a national digital banking strategy. And then the number of your competitors have talked about that, and launching national digital bank.","But any evolution in your thoughts on that? Whether it would make sense to the client acquisition tool or deposit gathering tool?","Darren King","To be honest with you, it's really not been something that's been at the top of our list of ways to gather deposits. But if we need to move pricing, we can do that with our existing customers and bring back some of the balances that maybe they don't have at M&T.","And that we can grow balances within our footprint without eating that extra funding source, where generally our experience have been those customers are incredibly rate-sensitive and also not likely to become full relationship customers.","And when you look at M&T and how we've always gone to market and the value we bring, it's been bringing the whole bank of our customers to help solve their needs, whether they are individuals, whether they are small business or whether they're commercial customers, and that's really been and continues to be our focus.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys, There is actually Ricky for Matt. So a quick question on the Trust business. It was a strong quarter, that's great. I was wondering if you can give more color on sort of what drove...","Darren King","I'm sorry, could you speak up a little bit, Ricky, you're a little faint coming over.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Can you hear me now?","Darren King","Perfect. Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","Just a question on the Trust business, I wonder if you can give a little more color on what drove the strength year-over-year? And then how much of an uptick linked quarter was from the seasonal tax fees?","Darren King","So I'll answer the second one first. $4 million is approximately the increase from first quarter in tax fees, which is also pretty consistent with the increase we saw in the second quarter of 2017 over the first quarter.","When you step back and you look more broadly at Trust fees, there's really two primary drivers going on there. One is, we continue to grow assets under management by adding new customers.","And the other is existing balances are enhancers capital markets move up. It's probably two thirds, one thirds new customers versus capital markets, but both things have been working in our favor. And that's what drove those increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, good morning, This is actually Josh on for Ken. So you guys hold to your guide for low nominal expense growth for this year. But could you help us think through what that implies for the second half?","Darren King","For the second half, is your question for the second half in relation to the first half?","Unidentified Analyst ","Yes, my question is based on, I mean, year-over-year growth for this quarter was around 3.5% over the previous 2Q. So I guess, that would imply deceleration of year-over-year growth in the second half. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Darren King","Yes. So I think you got to look at the total expenses for the year. And when we give the total expenses for the year, that includes the compensation costs in the first quarter of both years. So typically the second half expenses are lower than the first half just because of the seasonal comp expenses that happen in the first quarter. This year, the first quarter was also elevated because of the litigation reserve increase that we had of $135 million.","And I think the whole -- if you take out the litigation and you take out the comp costs, seasonal comp costs, you're probably up 1%. There's some other factors that are in our other cost of operations in the first half. One of the big ones is legal expense, and that was related to the defense of the Wilmington Trust Corporation matter.","And while those should come down in the second half, I am not sure that will be completely eliminated as that goes through the sentencing and appeal process. So there would be a little bit of expense in there. But some of those factors are why we think the total guidance still makes sense for full year to full year.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay. Got it. And could you talk through of how you're thinking about layering in additional swaps as we move through the rate cycle?","Darren King","The swaps that we have on and that we look at, we kind of watch quarter-to-quarter. And when you look at where we've been, we've kind of been 2 years out. And as we've gone through time, the original swaps that we're on when they got to about 18 months remaining on them, we extended them another 6 months. But really, we're trying to just take some of the volatility that can come in our net interest margin, net interest income off the table, and also protecting a little bit of the downside.","How much we do in swap activity going forward will also be a function of how well or how fast the deposit's repriced, because at some point as the deposits price up, that reduces some of that asset sensitivity, we don't need the swaps to take that off the table. So we're kind of looking at how deposits are repricing, how the balance sheet is shifting and the mortgage is paid down. Those things combined give us -- we'll be looked at when deciding what swap activity we might choose to engage in.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it. Thanks for your time.","Darren King","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Darren King","Morning.","Erika Najarian","I just had a few follow-up questions. Darren, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that the wider spread between LIBOR and fed funds and the outperformance of deposit pricing was 12 basis points the margin. And I'm wondering, as we look forward, you have been recently beating that 5 basis points to 8 basis points range. Could you break down how much of that 12 basis points is due to the LIBOR and fed funds spread versus the outperformance on the deposit side?","Darren King","So when you look at the 12 basis points, Erica compared to our 5 basis points to 8 basis points, we break it down that of the 12 basis points -- of the difference of 4, probably 3 is LIBOR and may be an additional 1 is because of just lower-than-expected deposit reactivity. When we quote the 5 basis points to 8 basis points, one of the things that drives that range is the pace of deposit reactivity. So deposit reactivity is already kind of built into that guidance.","And really what we've seen for the last couple of quarters is really that one month LIBOR move much sooner than the fed funds, and what we've traditionally seen and what we model, and then just a little bit less deposit reactivity than what might be included in that 5 basis points to 8 basis points.","Erika Najarian","Including that 5 basis points to 8 basis points, what is the deposit reactivity that you have embedded in there relative to your experience today?","Darren King","Well, the reactivity we have embedded in there, obviously given where we're going is higher than what we've experienced in the last couple of moves. But the reactivity when we build that up is actually done by deposit category by 25 basis point increment. So when you look at what that's been by category, some categories performed very close to what we expected, like the government balances and some of the mortgage escrow balances.","And when you look at some of the consumers, those have been less. When we look kind of through-the-cycle, what have we experienced in the past, probably 40% to 60% reactivity. Obviously, so far the cycle we've run well below that. But over the long-term, that's probably where we'd expect to run.","Erika Najarian","But just wanted to clarify, if I think about the overall deposit base, what is embedded in that 5 to 8 basis points? Is that you're already within that through-the-cycle range of 40% to 60%?","Darren King","No, no. We're running below that. And you can kind of see that in the news in the deposit rates year-to-date.","Erika Najarian","No, no. Of course. I guess, I was just trying to understand what was in guidance; whether or not, just because it seems like that, that 5 to 8 basis points is relatively conservative outlook relative to what we've seen over the past few quarters.","And so, I guess, what the Street has been getting wrong is perhaps the reactivity on the deposit side. So as we think about taking that guidance forward and taking into account everything that you said about deposit pricing going forward by category, is what's embedded in that 5 to 8 basis points?","An assumption that we're near to through-the-cycle cumulative range? In other words, if we don't believe that we're going 40% to 60% next quarter, then you could outperform the 5 to 8 basis points?","Darren King","Yes. So when you look at where the -- what the deposit reactivity is, that's in those assumptions that we included in the K and the Q. You're probably closer to the bottom end of that through-the-cycle estimate, and we've been running a little bit ahead of that. Until recently, I think you've seen that pace start to pick up. So we would expect on a go-forward basis that we'd be closer to that 5% -- 5 to 8 basis point range.","The other thing to keep in mind in there is, we brought that range down a little bit because of some of the hedging activity that we had done that we had some caps and some fluids and that the caps would reduce some of the upside as the rates went higher.","And then the other thing that can kind of cause some moment from quarter-to-quarter just in the rate is Trust demand deposits. And as those come on and off the balance sheet, they can cause that net interest margin to move 2 to 3 basis points up or down depending on whether those balances are coming on or off.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our final question will come from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Darren King","Morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","Darren, I got on a little late. So it's -- I guess, wanted the detail on the expense questions. You can just, I guess, give me your read about it [indiscernible] On the expense side, Darren, the other costs, so both the advertising and marketing and the other miscellaneous expenses were a little bit higher than the adjusted sort of third quarter and the other and then just the advertising quarter-over-quarter was a lot higher than normal.","So I know there was a question earlier as far as the second half of the year, so it feels like that those two lines probably should normalize a little bit for the next 2 quarters. Does that make sense?","Darren King","Yes. So I guess, if you look at the 3 kind of big categories where there was some moment this quarter, salaries and benefits was one of them. And now, we've talked about -- we signaled in January that increase that would start to show up, and it started to show up this quarter, it will continue a little bit into the third and fourth quarters before it reaches kind of a more normalized run rate.","Advertising and promotion tends to be a little bit back-end loaded in the year, and that for us the sales cycle really is February to November. And that things slow down a bunch in December and January. And so the rate that we saw this quarter is probably more typical of what you can expect in the second and third-- sorry, in the third and fourth quarters of the year.","And then in other, there is little bit of, I wouldn't call it onetime, because I don't want misstate it, but things that shouldn't repeat themselves at the same rate, namely, some of the legal expenses that we incurred in getting to the settlement with the Wilmington Trust Corporation matter, we don't know that they would go all the way to zero as we go through the back half of the year, because there will probably still be some sentencing and appeal procedures that will require some expense. But we do expect those to be down somewhat from where they were in the second quarter.","Brian Klock","Got it. Okay. So it would make sense to think about maybe a third quarter or the fourth quarter, if you look at your guidance, and I think your nominal year-over-year expense growth adjusting for litigation expense in the first quarter, they're like a 2% year-over-year growth rate, but that's on rate when you say nominal?","Darren King","Yes. Probably, 2% to 3%.","Brian Klock","Okay. So the 2%, it looks like the third and fourth quarter should be lower than the second quarter, I think that's what you mentioned on earlier -- answer to an earlier question?","Darren King","In that range, yes. Move around a little bit maybe third and fourth, but certainly, when you look at the second half to the first half, in aggregate, the second half expenses should be less just because of the seasonal comp and the onetime litigation. If you take those out, probably it will be pretty close to one another.","Brian Klock","Okay. Another question just on the FDIC surcharge. I'm not sure if you talked about it yet, but is there any assumption that this is getting closer to being fully funded now? And it seems like it could grow in the fourth quarter, is that in your guidance at all or is that something\u2026","Darren King","A great clarification, Brian. We've assumed that, that will go in the fourth quarter.","Brian Klock","Okay. So it's about like $10 odd million a quarter, that's the surcharge?","Darren King","Roughly. Yes.","Brian Klock","Okay. And then last question, sorry to run it again, if you answered that, I apologize, but you guys did take some of the tax benefit and increased some wages, is that something that's still going to impacting the third quarter? Or is it in the run rate yet or is it still something that might be in the run rate into the...","Darren King","It's something that has started to work its way into that line and you will continue to see some movement up there in the third and fourth quarter. And we expect that the fourth quarter run rate will be fully reflective of those changes that are happening.","Brian Klock","Okay. And just last question, I promise, can you remind me just how much that is for the full year impact, like $25 million?","Darren King","On a full year basis, we think it's $20 million to $25 million, probably half of that may be slightly less than half of that in the second half of this year.","Brian Klock","Great. Thanks for your time. Appreciate it.","Darren King","Sure.","Operator","That was our final question.

M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Ren\u00e9 Jones.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in this morning\u2019s press release, the past year was one of substantial progress for us. Our results included lower credit costs, as well as notable improvements in our liquidity, capital and overall risk profile. We made excellent progress on our critical initiatives to strengthen M&T\u2019s BSA\/AML compliance and overall risk management infrastructure.","And while the target investments that we made moderated our return on tangible common equity to a shade below 14% for the year, the -- taking these steps now positions M&T well for the changing -- for the change to banking environment.","Our results for the last quarters -- our results for last year\u2019s final quarter were characterized by higher revenues, dampened by a slightly higher tax rate. As we usually do, I'll start by reviewing a few of the highlights from M&T\u2019s fourth quarter and full year results, after which Don and I will be happy to take your questions. Remember that you can reenter the queue if you have additional questions that haven't been answered.","Turning to the details, diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.92 for the fourth quarter of 2014, improved from $1.91 in the third quarter and a $1.56 in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Net income for the quarter was $278 million, up from $275 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $221 million in a year ago quarter. There were no noteworthy items impacting M&T\u2019s third and fourth quarter 2014 results. However, recall that our results for the fourth quarter of 2013 included an after-tax $24 million litigation related accrual, which amounted to $0.18 per share.","As you are all aware, since 1998 M&T is consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. Our after-tax expense [$0.26] [ph] per common share in the recent quarter, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter.","Net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $282 million, up slightly from $280 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.95 for the recent quarter, up from a $1.94 in the linked quarter.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1.18% and 13.55% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.24% and 13.8% in the third quarter of 2014. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $688 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of $13 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.10% during the quarter, down 13 basis points from 3.23% in the third quarter.","The margin compression included the following component, substantially all of the decline came as a result of higher deposits from our institutional trust business and which we in turn held at the Federal Reserve.","On an average basis interest-bearing deposits with banks including the fed were nearly $4 billion higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, that increase added to net interest income, but diluted the margin by an estimated 13 basis points.","The credit performance of our acquired loan portfolio continues to outperform relative to our previous estimates. As a result, three years after the Wilmington Trust merger and five years after the Provident merger, we continue to realize higher than projected cash flows from those required portfolios.","In the fourth quarter, interest income on all acquired loans was $49 million, increased from $43 million in the previous quarter. This had the effect of boosting the net interest margin by about 3 basis points, which was offset by a like amount of compression in the core margin.","Average loans increased by $1 billion or 6% annualized compared to the third quarter. The improved face of activity we saw late in the third quarter carried through to the fourth quarter. On that same basis, average C&I loans increased an annualized 5%, influenced by seasonal strength in the auto floor plan portfolio.","Average commercial real estate loans increased by about 9% annualized. This included double-digit annualized growth in Upstate and Western New York, and improved activity in New York City -- in our New York City Metropolitan region, which had M&T includes New Jersey and Greater Philadelphia, as well as New York.","Also contributing to that growth is a larger held for sale pipeline in our commercial mortgage banking operation, which had its strongest quarter since the second quarter of 2013.","Residential mortgage loan volumes increased an annualized 1% and average consumer loans grew an annualized 7%, reflecting growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans. Overall, end of period loan growth was just slightly stronger than the average, up $1.1 billion or 7% annualized.","The past quarter results are relatively consistent with what we've been seeing over the past 12 months, with better growth in Upstate New York and in the New -- Metro New York City area, driven by somewhat stronger economic growth that we're seeing in Pennsylvania, Baltimore and elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic, and this is despite the intense competition that we see across the entire footprint.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over 250,000 increased an annual annualized 27% in the third quarter, reflecting the increase in trust deposits, I referred to you earlier. Given their typical short-term nature the trust deposits declined meaningfully by the end of the quarter and reached to more normal level on an end of period basis.","Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income totaled $452 million in the fourth quarter, little change from the prior quarter. There were no securities gains or losses in either period.","Mortgage banking revenues were $94 million in the fourth quarter relatively unchanged from the prior quarter. Lower revenues associated with residential mortgage origination activities were offset by strong origination activity on the commercial side, commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale declined by about 16%, while the gain on sale margin was relatively unchanged.","Fee income from deposit services provided were $106 million during the fourth quarter, compared with $110 million in the linked quarter, reflecting a slowdown in consumer service charges, as well as in commercial fees.","This was offset by higher credit related fees, which are included in other revenues from operations and which were -- noticeably stronger in the fourth quarter compared with somewhat soft third quarter.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude expense from the amortization of intangible assets, were $673 million, also little change from the prior quarter.","Salary and benefits were $345 million, down $4 million from $349 million in the third quarter. Furniture, equipment and occupancy costs were $62 million, down $5 million from the prior quarter, reflecting -- primarily reflecting lower depreciation expense.","All other operating expenses were up by $10 million from the previous quarter. The increase relates to cost of litigation defense, as well as investments in technology and risk management infrastructure.","Expenses arising from the BSA\/AML compliance initiative were essentially flat. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization, was 59.1% for the fourth quarter compared with 59.7% in the prior quarter and 65.48% in the year ago quarter.","Next, let\u2019s turn to credit. Our credit quality remains extremely strong. Non-accrual loans declined further from the end of the third quarter. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans declined by 9 basis points to 1.20% at the end of the fourth quarter.","Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $32 million, compared with $28 million in the third quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the fourth quarter, consistent with the full year figure and slightly up -- and up slightly from 17 basis points in the previous quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $33 million for the recent quarter. The allowance for credit losses was $920 million, amounting to 1.38% of total loans as of the end of December. The loan loss allowance as of December 31st was 7.6 times 2014\u2019s net charge-offs.","Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition were $245 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, the loans, $218 million or 89% are guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital, M&T\u2019s Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 9.83% at the end of December, up 7 basis points from 9.76% at the end of September and up 61 basis points from the end of 2013. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under the Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis is 9.59% at the end of 2014.","Before we turn to the outlook, I will take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2014\u2019s full year results. GAAP based diluted earnings per common share were $7.42 compared with $8.20 in 2013. Net income was $1.07 billion, compared with $1.14 billion in the prior year.","Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles and merger-related expenses, was $1.1 billion compared with $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. And diluted net operating income per share was $7.57 per share, compared with $8.48 per share in 2013.","The rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity for 2014 was 1.23% and 13.76%. Recall that results for 2013 included $67 million of net after-tax securities and securitization gains, amounting to $0.51 per share, which were incurred as we reposition the balance sheet for our first-time participation in the CCAR program.","Other noteworthy items impacting 2013 results were an after-tax $15 million benefit from the reversal of a purchase accounting accrual related to the Wilmington Trust merger and the litigation related accrual I referred to earlier.","Turning to the outlook, as is our usual practice without giving specific guidance, we\u2019d like to share our thoughts for the coming year. We are looking for loans to grow at a pace consistent with the 4% increase we've seen over the past 12 months.","Investment securities will increase as we execute -- should increases as we execute the remaining actions needed to reach compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio. And offsetting those increases should be a decline in cash held at the Fed, as trust deposits have returned to more normal levels.","Our guidance on the net interest margin is little changed. We are expecting about 3 to 4 basis points of core margin compression per quarter. If short-term rates start to rise as the forward interest rate curve currently implies, the impact will tend to be offset by -- that impact will tend to be offset.","Purchase of securities, as we complete our LCR build-out over the next three quarters, we will further dilute the margin but should have little impact on net interest income. I think it's important to note that as you think about those comments, that our 310 margin for the fourth quarter of 2014, as a starting point, obviously was influenced by that 13 basis points that we mentioned with higher cash balances.","We are looking for low single-digit growth in fee revenues. Our growth last year in core wealth and institutional service business was in the mid-single digits and we are looking to match, if not better that pace in 2015. We see the possibility of an absolute decline in mortgage banking fees depending on where interest rates go.","Consistent with our previous comments regarding expenses, we anticipate normalizing some of the professional service spending in 2015, as some of our work streams reach completion. That said, we still have some infrastructure and technology initiatives that we are working on, that will absorb some of those savings. And at the same time, we are rapidly turning our attention to optimizing our business model in a way that produces positive operating leverage.","At 59.06%, our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter has improved slightly from the previous quarter and down 640 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect continued progress as we get to the fourth quarter of 2015. Given the environment, we expect lower spending in 2015 as compared to last year and our goal is to produce positive operating leverage.","I\u2019ll remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in the first quarter of 2015, which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation, as well as a handful of other items. Last year, that increase was in the neighborhood of $40 million.","We see no indications of a change in the credit cycle. But with net charge-offs for the full year at just 19 basis points which is roughly half our long-term average, our conservatism won\u2019t let us count on beating that figure in 2015. With respect to capital, we have effectively closed any gap that we had versus our peer regional banks. This lets us turn our attention to enhancing the efficiency of our capital structure at these higher levels.","And I will conclude my remarks -- my prepared marks with the topic that I\u2019m sure you are all closely focused on, the merger with the Hudson City Bancorp. As we\u2019ve noted, we feel we have made tremendous progress on all of our initiatives and milestones across our most important work streams. Both parties remain committed to the merger and as you know, agreed to extend the date after which either party may terminate the merger agreement to April 30, 2015.","Finally, the financial metrics we calculated at the time of the transaction -- at the time the transaction was announced remain intact. Of course as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, local events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Lorie will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","Good morning, Ren\u00e9. Good morning, Don","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good morning.","Brian Klock","Hi, guys. So just two quick questions on the margins, thinking about where the current curve is and your commentary about LCR. So just thinking about the excess liquidity, the accretable yield number. If we take it -- maybe it's a 3.20ish, 3.24 number that we go into next year with, I guess what should we be thinking about as far as what you need to do on an LCR purpose to kind of build up your securities balances, your HQLA?","I noticed that your investment securities balances are down about $350 million in the fourth quarter. So, is that something you would do throughout the year? Or is this something that maybe you would wait till there is maybe a better outlook in the long end of the curve? So maybe just talk about what you are thinking about with those LCR actions in 2015.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Thanks, Brian. I mean, I think that\u2019s relative straightforward. We had a fair amount of purchases in the first three quarters of 2014. We took a pause in the fourth quarter. And I think our plan would kind of be to go back and do the same to sort of finish out the work that we have to do.","So my sense is that the first three quarters of '15 will look generally very similar to what we\u2019re doing in '14. And I think beyond that that should bring us well into compliance. I mean, we are in very good shape today. And I think what you will see next year is closing the final gap and then obviously thinking on the liability side beginning to replace debt, that\u2019s maturing and getting into more of a routine cycle.","Brian Klock","Okay. And a follow-up question on capital. I think you are right, thinking about where your TCE and your core capital is, your common equity Tier 1 all fully phased-in are at levels -- at above some of your peers versus when you announced the Hudson City deal. I guess with the CCAR that you just submitted, I guess what are you guys thinking about return of capital and maybe be in a position to ask for a buyback or what level of Tier 1 common would you be comfortable with in order to start returning capital again?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, I think I can respond to in sort of general terms. I mean, so, as you know, we got through one CCAR and we\u2019re pleased with how we fared. We believe and feel very comfortable that we made further enhancements, particularly to the sustainability of the process. So we are pretty pleased with the work we\u2019re doing going in.","From a general perspective, in terms of priority now that we have a higher amount of core loss absorbing capital, we\u2019re heavy on the hybrid side. So we\u2019ve not sort of one of the few people that have not yet optimized their hybrid. So that\u2019s something that sort of falls into the first priority for us to figure out how to begin to take those instruments that won\u2019t qualify as core capital or regulatory capital and move those off of our balance sheet.","And then as we kind of work through fully implementing out our risk management infrastructure, I think it\u2019s very logical that what you would see overtime, I can\u2019t really talk about the timing, but that we would take what is very, very low payout, total payout ratio now relative to the average and we begin to sort of move that in sync.","So for us, at some point in time it\u2019s -- bank maintains its historical position. We tend to generate a lot more capital than others, but I think our plan is to sort of steadily make improvements in getting back to a more efficient space there. Timing, I can\u2019t really talk about.","Brian Klock","So I guess as far as the -- that timing could be something that, would you feel comfortable with the Hudson City merger closing this year, being able to put a capital return into this year's numbers?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, I mean, regardless of any CCAR test and what have you, I mean for us to be buying back shares while we\u2019re entering a transaction just sort of outside of our thought process and our philosophy, our policy, not really our policy but just our behavior. So, that\u2019s not something that we really have ever done.","Brian Klock","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for your time.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Matt.","1","Matt Burnell","Good morning, Ren\u00e9. How are you?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good.","Matt Burnell","Just a couple of questions. One on the trust income line. I know you mentioned that you are expecting some growth in that next year. I guess I'm just curious if you are thinking about potential investment in that business, maybe not inorganic growth, but just further investment in that business along the line of what several other regional banks have done to try to boost fee revenue?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","That\u2019s a good question. I mean, I think right now I often say that when we do transactions that there is the pricing, there is the integration, but then there are the merging of the systems, but then there is longer integration. And the way I think about it is, we are always open to opportunities, but we are very, very heavily focused on continuing to make improvements into our back-office or infrastructure and our investment platforms. We are still really very much in an investment mode in that space.","And it\u2019s been very nice to see that the topline revenue growth has consistently grown since the -- what has been 2.5 years since the merger, 3.5 years. And so that\u2019s been positive, but we are still in investment mode. So to the extent that there is now lot of opportunities out there, we are not out there chasing them. But obviously down the road if something were to make sense for us to do, we would probably entertain it.","Matt Burnell","So barring an acquisition, it sounds like you are still thinking about sort of mid-to-low single-digit growth in that line item, specifically for 2015.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, definitely.","Matt Burnell","Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","And then, what I would say is that in that business topline and bottomline over the longer term are not the same because there is opportunity for leverage, right. And then the way we are thinking about it as well is the fee income aspect of it is very attractive as well.","Matt Burnell","Right. Makes sense. Just a question on your C&I business, maybe a little bit on the CRE side of things. What has been your experience the last quarter or two in terms of demand for lines? And some of your competitors have suggested that in 2015 there may be some elevated pricing on C&I lines just as they begin to work through some of the capital implications from some of the regulatory pronouncements, but just curious as to how you are thinking about that heading into 2015?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I guess, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re in a different space. I mean, we have been pretty disciplined throughout. And what I can\u2019t talk about next year, but as I look at this quarter, talking to every single region, the one thing that\u2019s become common is that there is consistent competitive pressure. So from time to time when we get together, you will see some regions feel a little bit less pressure than others this and the fourth.","As we finish the year everybody was very loudly speaking about the fact that our competitive pressure was relatively intense and probably stronger in the second half of the year than in the first. Generally speaking, the big issue that we are seeing -- one of the big issues that we are seeing across the board is that people are moving out in terms of term, 10-year deal structures on commercial real estate.","And what\u2019s interesting about that is it's hard because our metric is pretty pure. So we, sort of, are questioning whether people are really getting the right risk-adjusted pricing for that that added term but generally other than that, no other big changes.","Matt Burnell","Okay. One final question and I'll go back in the queue. You mentioned appropriately managing your capital structure would include getting rid of or refinancing some of the hybrids. Would you be thinking about refinancing those hybrids in terms of perpetual preferred stock or is there some other product you're thinking about?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, we\u2019ve got the appropriate amount of perpetual preferred stock for a balance sheet of our size or balance sheet of our size with, if you were to include Hudson City. So it's just actually excess sitting there.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.","Bill Carcache","Thanks. Good morning. Hi, hi Ren\u00e9. I guess just in terms of thinking about a range of different potential outcomes, let's just say for the sake of argument that you guys did not receive approval to close on the Hudson City deal. Can you help us understand what would happen to your efficiency ratio over the next few quarters as you would unwind some of what you guys have done in anticipation of closing?","It seems like you'd retain the benefit of much of the BSA\/AML spending that you've done. But I was hoping maybe you could parse out for us how much of your expense base you'd be able to cut, to the extent that you think about the future without Hudson City being a part of it?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ll start up with saying, we don\u2019t think about it in any different with or without, I mean, the numbers might change but we don\u2019t think about it any differently because our key is sort of make sure that the core of our institution is very healthy. And so as we look at the current environment, I think it's a good reflection of what we\u2019re likely to see as the banking industry going forward and revenue growth is very slow.","You saw that we had mid-single-digit loan growth and we had some measures I mentioned of margin compression. And then on the fee side, our mortgage banking is relatively elevated. So it\u2019s hard to see that growing dramatically. So I think you're in a slow revenue growth environment with a lot of healthy institutions competing for a few solid customers.","We've been here several times before and part of that equation is looking at sort of the operating leverage. So as we go into -- as we go into \u201815, we would expect to see continued improvement. I won't repeat my comments around the spending on our projects most of which is in -- is in -- heavily in professional services. But if you just take that topic for a minute, if you were to look at our peer group which includes 11 institutions, so 12 with M&T.","Typically over time, we are in the top quartile in terms of return on it -- return on tangible assets. And if you were to look through the third quarter with our higher level of spending related to these initiatives, we\u2019re actually just outside of the top quartile. The single largest difference if you go across margin, different fee categories is the single largest difference is our spending and professional services. And simply moving that to the average spend for the peers puts us squarely in the top two or three position and in terms of return on tangible assets.","Now we are focused on our overall business. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re beginning to look around and think about other ways in which we should be optimizing the firm at a time we\u2019ve gone through all this change. But if you look at just that particular item, it really is very telling as to what sort of has dragged down our returns of it. So we\u2019ll have heavy focus there. And then I think we'll try to gain traction with some other initiatives that maybe we can get into full swing in the second half of -- our second half or towards end of \u201815 that will help us going into \u201816. So I expect continued improvement in our operating leverage.","Bill Carcache","Okay. So is it fair to say that your comments or your outlook, your goal of achieving positive operating leverage in 2015, that's something that you're targeting with regardless of whether the deal closes?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. Yes definitely and in fact as I guess I'm thinking about it, I'm not thinking about the deal when I\u2019m saying that.","Bill Carcache","Okay, that's great. Switching gears to margins, just setting aside the effects of excess liquidity that you are parking at the Fed and some of your comments around the LCR actions, could you help us understand what happens to your NIM if rates were to hold at current levels?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","That is the three to four, that is the three to four.","Bill Carcache","Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I tried to say it in a different way. I mean, I guess, if you would move the LCR out of the way and you use the forwards largely if you believe the forwards, you don\u2019t have much compression just looking at the forwards through to the end of 2015. But our current pace has been three to four and to the extent that we don't see increase in rates that's where it will be.","Bill Carcache","Okay. That's great. And finally, the last one for me is on your effective tax rate. It was a little bit higher this quarter, anything noteworthy there? Can you talk about maybe what was behind that and where we should expect it to settle going forward?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. It\u2019s a great topic in the sense that we\u2019ve got so few shares outstanding that our numbers are really sensitive. So it\u2019s like a couple million buck. So no, you really can attribute to any one thing maybe in a period we have lower credits available. But on the whole, I don\u2019t expect any significant change when you look at \u201814 versus \u201815.","Bill Carcache","Got it. Thanks, Ren\u00e9. Appreciate it.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great, good morning. Ren\u00e9, could you just go back to the comments on CRE, or the CRE growth? I just want to reconcile the comments that you were making about competition and 10-year terms versus the very strong growth you guys had in the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah, I mean -- I guess the big thing that I could do is kind of talk about what we saw. So one of the things that I thought was really relatively interesting in particular as we sort of finished the year is that like this quarter, over the last 12 months, our loan growth has been comprised of 5% in the New York City Metro, Philadelphia and New Jersey area and 5% in upstate New York and essentially flat i.e. zero in Pennsylvania and in the sort of Baltimore, Washington area.","And you know a lot of the -- there is a sort of a greater abundance, at lease, in our portfolio on the real estate side as you get down to the Washington area. And what we sort of seeing there is that that there appears to be sort of -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an inflection point but there is abundance of office space. You got to remember that the sequestration stuff is still affecting the economy there and then in the defense sector.","So it just seems like as we look back over the last 12 months that really the slower growth we\u2019re being seeing there in total and in the real estate side has been affected by the economy whereas here in upstate New York, it's been stronger than it has been quite frankly in the last 30 years. And similar is true down in and around our metro region.","Other than that, I mean, the commentary is very consistent across the board. So what you're seeing and we were able to get the growth, the billion dollars of growth that you saw in our loan book 6% while that\u2019s just coming from our core customers. And when we\u2019re winning, it's usually because we have some sort of long-term relationship advantage that allows us to sustain the deal that provide some benefit beyond pricing, particularly, when it comes to smaller community banks.","So a lot of pressure that we\u2019re seeing is coming from the smaller community banks but they just don't have the breadth of services. So if you\u2019re getting a larger more mature client, we tend to have a bit of an advantage there.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Then the growth, the loan growth outlook, I think it was 4% over the next year. Is that predominantly driven by commercial real estate or is that a little more balance between CRE and some of the other categories?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. I mean, I think it's very much the same as both across the board, maybe a little greater on the consumer side but it's a smaller portfolio.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on the margin. Ren\u00e9, can you tell us how much of the deposit growth you experienced in the fourth quarter you expect to flow out, and sort of, and timing as well? And to that end, you would still have some excess deposits. Do you expect that to be funding your future HQLA purchases?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. So roughly at the fed we had $9 billion in the quarter and at the end of the quarter it was already down to six. So three of the four rise was sort of off our balance sheet by the end of the year. So that gives you some sense of the normalization there.","Erika Najarian","And that would be it?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It\u2019s hard to say, depending on what the client needs are but my sense is that the year-end numbers are better number than what you saw during the quarter, that 5 billion or 6 billion is a better number. And then in terms of the LCR, we\u2019ll be back into the market with unsecured fundings primarily. And we really never, even though the deposits that we\u2019re talking about on the trust side, definitely qualifying the liquidity coverage ratio.","We kind of in our internal view, sort of cap the amount that we use because of the uncertainty around the availability of those deposits. So most of the LCR purchase would be funded at the wholesale market.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And a follow-up question. We heard you loud and clear that you expect progress throughout 2015 on the 59% efficiency ratio, and heard you loud and clear on how you could do that on the expense side. I'm wondering if this the 59% -- the progress from 59% can happen even if nothing happens to the curve?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I think, I said yes, I think, yes, we will continue. I just can\u2019t tell you how much but that\u2019s what our efforts will be to do. And quite frankly, the tougher the revenue environment is out there, the more time you actually have to focus internally on your operations. We've done it before so it tends to be something that we're pretty good at, so yes.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. That was clear. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey of FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning, Ren\u00e9. I had just a couple questions about fee income. On the mortgage banking side, could you split what of the income was origination versus servicing in the quarter?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yes, I probably can. Give me a minute. Someone will do that, so you can hear all the shuffling of paper running around.","Bob Ramsey","Thanks. I know you had noticed that the uptake in service in year-over-year with the acquisition? Maybe while you dig that up I\u2019ll ask another question about deposit fees. They were down I guess, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year this quarter. I know there has been a lot of focus industry wide on deposit fees. Just curious, there was anything unusual this quarter or how you're thinking about the deposit fee growth in 2015, whether it will be flat or even possibly lower than \u201814?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. We had some discussion about that. I mean, I personally think it was a little unusual. Last year they were down slightly but I think that was across the board in the industry with behavior changes but our volume of transactions was lower. We had some really nice -- very large storm in Buffalo but still with the year end and the holiday spend I was a little bit surprised about the nature of the decline. Having said that, it was both on the consumer and the commercial side. So I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see what underlying customer behavior is.","So we do this, I mean, I guess on the residential side, -- I\u2019m getting all this. So I mean, roughly we had about $70 million of our mortgage banking income was on the retail side and another $23 million was on the commercial side and of the $70 million, about $56 was on servicing.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then if I circle back around, I know you were asked about capital a couple ways. I might not have caught it. I know you said that that M&T has a very low payout ratio relative to average? I was just curious if you were speaking about total payout or dividend and I think historically you all have always had sort of a below average dividend payout ratio, but in an ideal world when you do start to look to take the payout up? Could you just sort of remind us how you think about dividend payout and where you'd like it to be?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I mean, I think, first of all, actually, I was talking about the total payout ratio, when I look across the industry.","Bob Ramsey","Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","And I think, you're right, we\u2019ve always been historically lower. We think, we felt, always felt that was a more prudent decision and of course, we didn't cut the dividend. So it sort of hovered around 30%, which is not atypical for we've been. I think what is atypical is the long period of actually not having any sort of increase in that dividend.","But as a general philosophy, I don't know that it's going to be very different. We think that it matters regardless sort of what the rules are currently that in order to have more flexibility, it probably makes sense.","At a point in time when you\u2019re distributing the normalized percentage of your earnings that making sure that a decent percentage of that or a large of that is in repurchases is probably where we would end up on the long run. I don\u2019t know if that tells you much, Bob.","Bob Ramsey","So, I think it does. I think if I understand you correctly, the dividend payout is in the right ballpark, I mean, maybe there is a little bit of room, but it's in the right ballpark and really the opportunity when the time comes is to be more active on the repurchase front.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I think that\u2019s right and I think, if you just don\u2019t get yourself into the guidance space for a minute, outside what we typically would do in this new environment. I think, really what it says is that you got to, to the extent that there is there is no hard limit, but to the extent that you are over 30, you should be very, very comfortable with your risk management platform and your ability to monitor and to see risks, identify risks.","And so a lot of the way we think about it is that over the last year and then in the coming year, we continue to make improvements. So we\u2019ll talk a lot about that during the course of the year in those areas and I think that may end up giving us more flexibility as those new structures mature.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Great. Thank you, Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey. Good morning, Ren\u00e9. Hey, Ren\u00e9, coming back to the net interest income, just wondering so with the normalization of those trust deposits? Can you just help us understand what the starting point is for the NIM when you reset that or assume that the 3.10% is kind of not so much a low point, but lower than you'd expect to start the year with that normalization?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Well, had the balances at the fed remained at $5 billion where they were in the previous quarter. The net interest margin would have been -- printed net interest margin would have been 13 basis points higher than the 3.10%, so 3.23%. And we've not gotten back, the whole $4 billion as of the end of the year. We got back three quarter of that, right. So you can pretty very much use those numbers to kind of figure it out.","Ken Usdin","Right. Okay. So then I just, I think, I'm trying to understand then, when you think about net interest income dollars, we have to think about the balance sheet likely to be smaller, but a higher starting point for the NIM and then you get the 3 to 4 core plus LCR?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","If there is no change in the rate environment, yes.","Ken Usdin","Okay.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","If there -- if the rate environment pans out like the forward curve say, you just get a total of probably something like 3 to 4 just for the LCR or some like that, right.","Ken Usdin","Right. So roughly speaking, no change, you get 6 to 8 and then you try to offset that with balance sheet growth? So, I guess, where brings it back to is like, off of the $2.7 billion of NII this year, do you think you can grow NII this year kind of like you were talking about on the fee side?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","It\u2019s our job to try. But it\u2019s a tough revenue environment.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Okay. And then on the cost side, Ren\u00e9, just a similar question coming back to the, can you remind us just how much of the consulting costs are in the current $680 million?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No. I don\u2019t have that number and I think, the best place to get it is off of the -- where is it comes on the [190] [ph]?","Don MacLeod","Yeah. It will, components of that will be reflects in [190] [ph] when it comes out.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Because I think the question is just -- similar question, Ren\u00e9, just on the cost side, you guys have been at the $680 million type level, plus or excluding the first quarter seasonal computation bump? And I think we're just trying to understand the moving parts between when you mentioned finally starting to rationalize some of that consulting cost versus the magnitude of those incremental investments? So can we finally start to see that other line start to net down or total expenses start to net down as that compliance -- as that consulting cost come -- starts to come in?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I think that\u2019s exactly how we think about it, I am not giving you a number, a little less prepared than I should be, because at the same sort of number that\u2019s it\u2019s been out there for a long time that you can actually see in the regulatory reports.","But that\u2019s exactly how we think about it and as each of the phases of the work streams, sort of work themselves down, there's a lot of excess professional services that are no longer necessary because they are covered by the existing staffing base that you\u2019ll see come down.","And it might not be all of that because we are continuing to invest in technology, in some of those areas as well. But there should be a noticeable amount by the time we get towards the end of the year.","Ken Usdin","Got it.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","We haven\u2019t seen it before that, but yes.","Ken Usdin","Understood. And the last point on that is, can you just give us an update just in general terms of where you are on those workstreams, in terms of the seven major kind of promises you have related to getting compliance and whatnot? Like, how many have we made through and are we at a point where you're actually now over the hump, so to speak?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I mean, generally, we would characterize ourselves as on track with every single workstream that we have. And I think probably one of the most meaningful things that\u2019s out there is -- think about this is, as by the time we get ourselves to March 31st for the first quarter, we will have had implemented our new customer risk rating system and it will have actually been running and in effect for a full year.","And so that's great because through the course of \u201814m as we\u2019ve run that we've been able to get some of the, any kinks out of the system and feel really good that as we onboard new customers that we\u2019ve got a good stable system to do that. So that I think is a real key milestone.","I think we've got to -- we use the term remediate our existing customer base. We\u2019ve got to do the entire customer base, 5 million accounts, 3.5 million households or 3.7 million households and we've gotten through the majority of the high-risk customers and we are on schedule with that work. And so no blips in sight there.","And of course the remaining group of moderate and lows, we will get through over time right. But that will take some time but we are on track. Transaction review is well underway. And I think I started talking about probably in the third quarter of last year and on schedule for completion. And then we have -- really are pleased with the fact that we now have controls in monitoring and management reporting that is under -- is being operated in every single business unit.","And that allows us to sort of escalate any customers\u2019 issues that are there. So relative to where we were before, we have made substantial progress. The capabilities that we have today versus where we were, say two years ago are vastly different. And so we feel very, very good about that progress.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, Ren\u00e9.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Sterne, Agee.","Terry McEvoy","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Out of the $11 billion of consumer loans, could you just remind us how much is auto? And could you provide possibly any commentary around competition and the ability for growth in that portfolio in\u201915?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. So if you look at the portfolio, it's about just under $11 billion. And in terms of average balances, the biggest portfolio there is a home equity line of credit which is $5.8 billion and our auto portfolio is just under $2 billion and that's rounded out with the next biggest thing is sort of\u2026","Don MacLeod","Primarily recreation finance.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","\u2026yeah recreation finance and other loans, other personal loans that are about $3 billion. So, I mean, I think with the consumer loans, those things tend to move in a very predictable pattern. We've seen pretty steady growth over the quarter so if you look for example, we said 7% over this past quarter. It was 7% year-over-year in terms of the fourth quarter, over fourth quarter. So, I would expect that to continue at that pace and maybe actually be slightly higher based on what we are seeing with the trends. We are not changing our credit profile in that space relatively conservatives.","Terry McEvoy","And then just as a follow-up. This morning, I took a look at the presentation you used in Boston last November and it mentioned stronger competition from bank and unregulated bank lenders. Could you talk about where the unregulated bank lenders are showing up? Has there been any impact so far and what has been your response? And then are any of the initiatives that we are seeing in the expense line, will they make M&T more competitive going forward?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Remember that second question. We are seeing it mostly in Commercial Real Estate. So you get life companies that have been in the game for quite some time now looking for yield and that\u2019s made things pretty competitive. You\u2019ve also had conduits back in that space. And then the thing that's little different this cycle is obviously you\u2019ve got non-bank lenders in the form of private equity.","And I think in particular spaces like leverage lending and some spaces like that where the regulation has been tightened up and there is higher scrutiny. Also different capital rules, I think, a number of private equity firms have decided to sort of offer their own credit. And as I mentioned before, we see that also because in Wilmington, we may provide the trustee services for those businesses.","So that's one place where we've actually seen quite a bit of activity. What\u2019s interestingly enough, that actually is a trend here in the U.S., but it's also a trend overseas in London, you are seeing the same types of activity. I think it's all driven by the higher forms of regulation. And then second part of your question was about whether we had any advantage from the work that we're doing. You want to ask that again? Did I get that right?","Terry McEvoy","That is correct. You're investing a lot. We see it in the expense line. And where is the upside as it relates to the competitive landscape that you just talk about, if any?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I mean, I think, look, if I look at what we\u2019re doing and I just, I look at clearly BSA\/AML program, clearly the risk management and compliance updates and then definitely on the technology side as well, every one of those investments is a leverageable investment.","And so one of the reasons why we -- or a number of reasons, but one of the reasons why we were so focused on doing this fast is because to the extent that you get behind you, you can sort of begin to participate, mature those things right and then use them as you grow the institution.","So I can\u2019t give you timing, but clearly we think of all of those investments and the investments that we will make in 2015 and that like. I think that\u2019s really important.","Terry McEvoy","Thank you.","Operator","One final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, Ren\u00e9.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize. I've been jumping on and off your call. But obviously, your Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is very strong today at about 9.6%, well above the required numbers a bank your size needs to have, about 7%. Recognizing you've got to carry more than that because of CCAR, looking longer-term, when you go through CCAR you guys come out real well. Where do you want to manage that number to in terms of once you get the Hudson City deal closed and you guys are back on a normal track?","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Yeah. I think, I sort of implied that in my comments earlier Gerard. I think the way I think about it is this is a process, right, and it\u2019s a process because we\u2019re going through a period of great change. So we took our efforts. We didn't issue shares during the crisis. We then built our capital up organically to where it is today. We made our investments our different platforms, particularly in the CCAR and risk management. We fared well in the CCAR test, right.","And then as we kind of go into this test, it\u2019s an evolution. So my sense is that from a pure capital perspective, you see in a test there is not a need given our risk profile to have higher capital levels. But I think the rest of that process is to make sure that our risk management process is to sort of keep monitoring that are very, very sustainable. That\u2019s the sort of phase we\u2019re in now.","And then as we kind of check that box, I think our job is to get back to normal distributions and get the capital out there back to the investors. I think that issue becomes exacerbated were we to consummate the Hudson city deal, because it essentially is a portfolio that under us would be much, much smaller, right, which then suggests it throws off a lot of equity and the only way you create value is to get that excess equity back to the shareholders over time.","Gerard Cassidy","I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","No, you go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","No, because my thought was bringing the capital ratios down for you and many of your peers, they seem to be so high and the ROEs for everybody are pretty weak. And so to get these stated ROEs back up to 12%, 13%, the Es need to come down. And I didn't know if longer term you guys would be comfortable with an 8.5% Tier 1 common ratio or is that just too low?","And then as an add-on to that, there is some talk about raising the asset size of CCAR banks. And if those asset sizes are raised to a level well above yours, assuming the Hudson City deal closes again, would you consider even a lower ratio? Because you guys historically manage your capital so well, now it seems like you've got so much extra capital.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","I don't think we\u2019re thinking about it that way right now, Gerard. I think that -- I don't think capital levels -- I wouldn\u2019t think about capital levels coming down from where they are today. I think that they are healthy, but they're probably for the industry where they were continued to be. When I look beyond that and I look into our portfolio and earlier I made some comments about sort of about return on tangible assets.","We typically are in the top quartile of our peer groups and we\u2019re not right. And so I see a fair amount of opportunity in trying to, now that we\u2019re under all the new rules and under all the new processes trying to figure out how to do them more efficiently and to optimize the spending that we've had in this big period of investment. And so really what I'm thinking about is making sure that we can take that return on tangible assets and move it back into sort of number the top three positions amongst our peers.","And I think we see ways to do that, and so that's about focusing our operations. I think over the course of the next couple of submissions two things will happen. One, we will get to a much more normalized payout ratio, because you will gone through the test and you will have a lot of evidence that suggests that not only on your models but under the national models, people have a good sense of what your profile is.","Down that road, I mean the way you would end up releasing capital from where you are today is probably you would have to show that you're having lower and lower risk profile under stress and that may happen. But that's really not a topic that I think is out there today.","Gerard Cassidy","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Ren\u00e9 Jones","Sure.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call to Don MacLeod for any additional or closing remarks.","Don MacLeod","Again, thank you all for participating today. And as always, if clarification of any of the items on the call or news release is necessary, please contact our Investor Relations Department at 716-842-5138.

Please go ahead, sir.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Paula, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link. Also before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Since this is my first conference call as Chief Financial Officer, I'll ask you to bear with me. Ren\u00e9 Jones most recently and Mike Pinto before him, set a high bar for CFOs in general and for M&T Bank in particular. I certainly have big shoes to fill. Before I start, I'd like to take a moment and thank Ren\u00e9 for the advice and guidance that he's provided to the company and to me personally over the time that we worked together, particularly during the last 90 days. I'm looking forward to working with many of you as well over the coming months and years.","Let's get started. In the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of revenue, net income of $336 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.98. Return on assets were 1.09% and return on common equity was 8.38%. Looking at the second quarter results on a net operating basis, which excludes the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets, earnings per share equaled $2.07. Return on tangible assets was 1.18% and return on tangible common equity was 12.68%.","Every measure noted above both on a GAAP and net operating basis improved from the first quarter. The efficiency ratio also improved to 55.1% in the second quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter, and 58.2% in the year ago quarter. We were able to deliver these results against the headwinds that we and our clients faced, including an uneven economic recovery in growth, persistent low interest rates and volatile financial markets.","There are many highlights from the second quarter that characterize the state of the bank and before we review the details, I'd like to take a minute to review a few of the more noteworthy developments. Probably the biggest highlight of the quarter was receiving a non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 CCAR capital plan. While we learned our results in the second quarter, the non-objection was the favorable result for months of hard work by many of our colleagues around the bank, as well as the payback on the investments we've made over the past several years in our risk management governance, processes and technology. We know however that the CCAR bar keeps rising and so this quarter we'll begin the preparations for CCAR 2017.","Another highlight of the second quarter is the continued growth of our loan portfolio. While on the surface 3% annualized loan growth isn't particularly exciting, a look at the details reveals that lending to commercial customers increased an annualized rate of 11% against the decline in the residential mortgage book of an annualized 16%, largely the result of expected runoff in the Hudson City mortgage portfolio. This is a pretty typical pattern when you're converting a thrift to a commercial bank. Against this backdrop, credit quality on M&T hallmark remains strong.","In the second quarter, as noted on prior calls, we've been reinvesting a portion of the savings from the merger and the BSA\/AML savings to position the bank for the future. We launched a brand campaign in New Jersey to introduce ourselves to the new market. We reminded our legacy markets who we are in the face of changing competition and we continued to invest in our technological infrastructure along several dimensions. For instance, in foundational elements like data, in employee tools like teller cash recyclers, and in customer convenience and security that will be seen in the form of our upcoming new and improved mtb.com website and enhanced security at our ATMs through the upcoming deployment of (5:06) protocols.","So while unique unto itself, this quarter reflects the continuous cycle of invest and harvest that has characterized M&T Bank for many years. Overall, we would describe it as a solid quarter.","Let's take a look at the details. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the second quarter of 2016, improved from $1.73 in the first quarter and equal to last year's second quarter. Net income for the quarter was $336 million, up 13% from $299 million in the linked quarter and up 17% from $287 million in the year ago quarter. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.04 per common share in the recent quarter compared to $7 million and $0.05 per common share in the first quarter.","Also included in the second quarter results were $13 million of pre-tax merger-related charges incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share. Merger-related expenses in the second quarter \u2013 or sorry, excuse me, merger-related expenses in the first quarter totaled $23 million pre-tax. That amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.","M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was $351 million, compared with $290 million in last year's second quarter and $320 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.07 for the recent quarter, improved from $2.01 in the year ago quarter and that figure was $1.87 in this year's first quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.18% and 12.68% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.09% and 11.62% in the first quarter of 2016. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.","If we turn our attention to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $870 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $8 million from the linked quarter. The decline reflected a combination of a narrowing of the net interest margin and a change in the mix of interest earning assets.","Let's look at the specifics. Net interest margin declined to 3.13%, down five basis points from 3.18% in the linked quarter. What we consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about three basis points of the decline. That includes the impact of a slightly more costly mix of deposits, including the impact of the Hudson City time deposits as well as growth in savings deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations.","On the non-core side, interest bearing deposits with banks, which primarily reflect cash on deposit at the New York Fed, averaged $8.7 billion during the second quarter, up by over $500 million from the prior quarter. That increase, the result of higher balances of trust deposits, decreased the margin by approximately one basis point.","Average investment securities declined, reflecting normal principal amortization as well as a step-up in prepayments. Those prepayments of higher yielding securities and a limited amount of reinvestment into lower yielding LCR compliance securities reduced the yield on the portfolio. We estimate these factors diminished the margin by an additional basis point.","The cost of deposits reflects, in part, our decision, which we previously discussed, to maintain pricing for customers in the Greater New York area whose accounts were formerly held at Hudson City Savings Bank. We'll offer more thoughts with respect to that pricing in a few moments.","Average loans increased by about 3% annualized or $572 million compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 14%. Commercial real estate loans increased by about 10% annualized. As noted earlier, those two categories combined grew an annualized 11%. Also, as noted, residential mortgage loans declined at an annualized 15% rate. Consumer loans grew an annualized 5% with growth in indirect loans, including auto loans, partly offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit. Loan growth was consistent across most of our footprint, including Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Greater New York City and New Jersey. Growth in the Mid-Atlantic region was slightly softer.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased at an annualized 8% from the first quarter, reflecting the higher level of trust and savings deposits that I mentioned earlier.","Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income totaled $448 million in the second quarter compared to $421 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $89 million in the recent quarter compared with $82 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $858 million in the quarter, up some 30% compared with the first quarter, while the gain on sale margin was relatively stable.","Our commercial mortgage banking operation had a strong quarter as well, with a slight increase in multi-family commercial mortgages originated for sale combined with a favorable mix of higher margin loans than that prior quarter. Trust fees improved to $120 million in the recent quarter, up from $111 million in the previous quarter. That increase reflects about $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that usually occur in the second quarter as well as fees from net new business, particularly on the institutional side. Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial loan fees also improved from the first quarter.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $726 million, improved from $741 million in the prior quarter. On that same operating basis, salary and benefits declined by $28 million from the seasonally high level in the first quarter. Partially offsetting that decline was a $16 million increase in other costs of operations, including higher professional services expenses. The operating efficiency ratio improved to 55.1% in the quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in last year's second quarter.","Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to say strong, with continuing low levels of non-accrual loans and net charge-offs. Non-accrual loans declined to $849 million and the ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans was 0.96%, improved from 1% at the end of the first quarter. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $24 million compared with $42 million in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter's results included $14 million of charge-offs associated with consumer loan customers who were either deceased or filed bankruptcy, compared with just $5 million in the recent quarter.","In addition, the results for the second quarter included a $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan. Reflecting that recovery, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 11 basis points for the second quarter, while the comparable figure was 19 basis points in the previous quarter.","The provision for credit losses was $32 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $8 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. The allowance for credit losses was $970 million at the end of June. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.10%, unchanged from the end of the first quarter.","Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value discount at acquisition, were $298 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $270 million, or 91%, are guaranteed by government-related entities.","Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.01% compared with 11.06% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects earnings retention less $154 million of share repurchases during the second quarter as well as net loan growth. I'll offer our thoughts on our 2016 capital plan, which received no objection from the Federal Reserve, in a few moments.","Next, I'd like to give you an update on several of the projects we've been working on. As previously announced, we completed the conversion of Hudson City during the first quarter, in which we converted them to our systems and operations, including loan and deposit accounting, mortgage servicing and other core applications. All the Hudson City facilities were rebranded to M&T at that time. Speaking of branding, those of you who work and live in the Greater New York, New Jersey market have undoubtedly seen a step-up in our advertising as part of this process.","More recently, we've been working on the longer-term initiative of converting Hudson City from a thrift culture to M&T's commercial bank culture. We're continuing to hire in the New Jersey market, including commercial lenders, business bankers, and wealth advisors. We've hired some 49 customer-facing employees since the beginning of 2016. To complement our commercial hiring, we've begun an accelerated business banking training initiative for some 30 Hudson City branch managers, who are on a fast track to learn M&T's branch sales practices. Training also continues for our other branch-based colleagues, increasing their familiarity with our entire suite of commercial bank products and services.","Our investments in technology include continuing to enhance our ability to capture and organize data for risk management and capital planning requirements as well as for improving customer service. These investments paid a dividend in the form of our 2016 CCAR results but, as noted earlier, the bar rises every year requiring continuous improvement in our risk management practices.","Beyond our data initiative, you should see some tangible results from our technology investments shortly, including a major update to our website within the next several weeks, and an updated mobile app that we anticipate rolling out later this year. We're also working on enhancing the tools we give to our employees to improve our interactions with customers by simplifying the processes that employees must follow to complete their work. These projects are still in the early stages.","Lastly, we've discussed in a general way, the opportunities presented to us by the changing competitive environment occurring, or about to occur in our footprint. We know from firsthand experience that change brings uncertainty. Whether it's with their personal banking or business banking, customers seek stability when considering their banking options. We are here to help customers in our communities as we have been for over 160 years. To offer one example, using checking account acquisition as a proxy for new customer acquisition, year-over-year growth in Greater Buffalo is nearly 19%, almost twice as large as the average across the remainder of the footprint.","Now, let's turn to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we are tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave you on the January call. While our outlook is mostly unchanged from the previous calls, one factor that has changed is the outlook for increases in the Fed funds rate. At the time of our January call, the forward rate curve was implying two actions by the Fed in calendar year 2016. There now appears to be a little prospect for even one increase this year, perhaps not even until mid-next year to late next year. But even without any Fed action, the curve has flattened with the yield on 10-year Treasuries touching an all-time low recently.","Our ability to maintain a stable year-over-year margin will be impacted by that changed interest rate outlook, but that could be somewhat offset by our ability to reposition the balance sheet, particularly with respect to trust deposits and the pricing on Hudson City time deposits. Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with or slightly better than our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans, both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate. Partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate. Absent rises in interest rates, we don't expect the pace of repayments to slow. Fee revenues remain in line with our expectations given the normal seasonal effects.","On expenses, our outlook for the second half of 2016 is to be somewhat consistent with the first half. This includes the FDIC surcharge imposed on banks over $50 billion in size, which will add about $5 million per quarter to our FDIC assessment as well as our ongoing investment program. We remain focused on producing modest positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We don't expect any additional merger-related expenses in connection with Hudson City. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short-term. We're still not seeing pressures on credit, either non-accrual loans or charge-offs.","Regarding our capital plan, we were delighted to receive no objection from our regulators to the plan we submitted in connection with the 2016 CCAR process. As you know, we plan to repurchase $1.15 billion of M&T common stock over the four-quarter period beginning July 1. In addition, the plan contemplates our board considering an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.75 per quarter in January of 2017. While there is no reason to expect we won't execute on this plan as proposed, I would remind you that all of these capital actions are subject to our normal capital governance policies and unexpected adverse macroeconomic events could impact our actions. Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now, let's open up the call to questions before which Paula will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","To follow up on the expense outlook of back half of the year similar to the first half, I guess first, just to clarify, is that on a reported basis or ex merger charges?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ex merger charges because we think we're finished with those one times as of the second quarter. So if you take those out and look at what our total expenses were in the first half, probably close to where we'll be in the second half of the year.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That helps. But I guess still like if I think about the back half, normally you have seasonality working in your favor since 1Q's high and you should still have cost saves coming in, I think, from Hudson City. So, I guess why flat versus down?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Sure. I think there's a few factors going on there, Matt, which affect things. So, first of all, we've got the FDIC assessment going up $5 million a quarter right there. What you'll see is that when we look at our other cost of operations, which is really where we're focused, legal expenses are up in the second quarter and will likely continue at that pace in the third quarter and fourth quarter and possibly increase slightly as we go through our defense with some of the Wilmington Trust indictments that are out there. And we will be continuing to make the investments that we've been talking about in the franchise, especially continuing on path with technology.","So, those are probably the big things that you'll see in there. Oh, and the other thing, of course, which I should mention, is we'll be right in the throes of some of the changes that will be happening in our marketplace in the third quarter and we'll probably spend a little more on advertising as we try to take advantage of the changes that are happening. So some of those things are kind of more permanent in nature, some of those \u2013 more permanent is probably a bad description. Some of those things will run their course over the rest of this year and some of them will probably take a little longer.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And how much was the litigation this quarter?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","I think it was roughly an increase of $4 million from what it was in the first quarter of the year.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sorry, do you have that number handy or is it in the 10-Q that I can look it up? The first quarter level?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, I think it was about $14 million. That's what it was for the quarter.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, that will probably stay elevated for maybe the near-term, medium-term, but obviously longer-term would hopefully come down then?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","That's how we're thinking about it.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, okay. Thank you very much.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Oh, hello, there. Thank you for taking the question. On the increase in deposit costs in the quarter coming, I think you said after Hudson City, could you remind us first of all the mechanics of why that's coming through now in 2Q when the deposits have been on the balance sheet for a couple of quarters?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, sure. I think really what you're seeing there is kind of what I would describe as a timing mismatch, that the rate of decrease in the Hudson City mortgage portfolio is about $900 million a quarter, and the rate of decrease in the time deposits, it has been closer to $100 million in the quarter. And that's been a conscious decision on our part to maintain that pricing while we get the branch staff ready to have a different conversation with those customers than they've had in the past. So because the mortgages are running off a little faster or a lot faster in this case than the time deposits are, the impact of those deposits on the margin is exaggerated.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And when do you think you start having some of those discussions and figuring out whether the relationships with those deposit customers make sense and if they don't make sense, get to rid yourselves of some of the interest expense that comes through from them?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So that process is going to begin this quarter, and will play itself out over the course of the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. If you look at the book, it's relatively short. I think 75% of it is 12 months or less. So that's kind of the timeframe over which these discussions will happen and it's something that we'll be focused on obviously over the course of the coming quarters.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Good morning.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","So, you guys had really good growth on the CRE side this quarter. That's sort of been a hot topic recently with the concentration limits of smaller banks and OCC's outlook on risk in the markets. I'm just kind of curious, your view on the competitive environment there. Whether you're seeing other banks pull back? Whether you're seeing kind of irrational pricing or irrational terms in some market and just kind of where do you think we are there?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Sure. I guess I'll offer a couple of thoughts as it relates to CRE. First, when we look at where our growth has come from, it's been fairly broad-based across our geographies and across property types, so we're not seeing any concentrations or things that we would point to that we would get worried about. When we look at pricing, I wouldn't say that it's going up, but it seems to have stabilized somewhat. So we feel better about that and when we look at the amount of equity that's in the deals, it's still at or above where things were back in 2006\/2007. So I think the market's learned its lesson as far as that goes. When we look in our markets and where we're winning business, it doesn't seem to be at the moment, coming from any particular competitor that might have reached concentration limits but I know that's an issue that's out there. I think when we do see things that look a little crazy to us, either in terms of pricing or structure, it tends to be the non-bank lenders that are in that space, and we would tend to shy away from that and keep our powder dry.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great, that's helpful, and can you give any color on where the commercial pipelines are this quarter compared to last quarter? Or how things are shaping up for the rest of the year?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, sure. When we look at the commercial pipeline and where it stands right now, it's pretty similar to where it was at the end of the first quarter. So when we look forward, I guess I don't have a reason to believe right now that we'll see a meaningful decrease in the production levels, but we're also not anticipating any crazy upticks either.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks so much.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","No problem, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good morning. One more follow-up on the net interest income side. To your point earlier about not potentially having the rate hikes, the loan growth and the remixing into securities seems to be a support, but underlying it you mentioned the three basis points of the core pressure and is that on an ex-rates basis how we should expect things to go from here which is that you're able to fight off the NIM pressure with the balance sheet growth?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","I think when we look at the NIM pressure and the ways that we fight it off, it's primarily with the deposit pricing and primarily with that CD book. Obviously, we'll use some of the proceeds, if you will, from the mortgage paydown to fund loan growth, but we'll need to supplement that on the deposit side. We think we've got ample funding between money that we have at the Fed as well as money that we have in savings account that we don't need to rely on that CD funding for growth. And as we can change that mix and bring the percentage of CDs on the balance sheet down somewhat, and\/or bring down the average rate that we're paying, that's the biggest lever that we have to fight off that margin compression.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Right. So we might not see a lot of earning asset growth but you might be able to offset the core pressure with the remixing.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","I think that's probably a true statement. I think the challenge will be at least in the near-term over the next couple of quarters just making sure we can outrun the net interest income impact of the runoff or the payoffs in the residential mortgage book from Hudson City.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And on the fee side, just one quick question, the wealth business had a good quarter. I know some of that is seasonal. Are we seeing a bit more stability in that business now and was there any help from fee waiver recovery in that line as well?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","I guess the way I tend to think about that business is you got the seasonality part right. When you take that out, we still had a nice quarter. We had some good growth in the institutional part of the wealth business. We saw some customer balance acquisition. The financial markets, it looked like they were going to hurt us a little bit with Brexit but in the end have been okay. And then on the waiver recovery, there's always waiver recovery, but there's always offsets too, right, that there's some new business that you might do some pricing actions to get a customer to join the business. So, I think net, you could say that there was some waiver recovery but it would be modest. It wouldn't be a big driver of the increase.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Good morning.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your plans for reinvestment of liquidity on the balance sheet and how you look at the securities book now, particularly given what we're looking at here on the longer end of the curve. Thanks.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, sure. I guess we're at an interesting point. Given where rates are and where the book sits today. I guess when we look at what some of the options are of where and how we can invest, the current yields on some of the investment options don't look particularly compelling. And I guess as the book pays down, we'll probably look to reinvest the paydowns back into the market, either in Ginnie Maes or Fannie Mae securities, but I don't think we're looking to really grow that book right now just given where interest rates are. We'd rather put the cash to work in loan business rather than in the securities book and try and keep that relatively flat unless we see a move in rates.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. All right. No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then separately on the capital front, just wanted to get your updated thoughts in terms of where you stand on the regulatory obligations still tied to the Hudson City merger and then also how soon you could be out there with some potential interest in bank M&A again? Thanks.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Sure. I guess as it relates to bank M&A, we've obviously \u2013 we continue to do our work to build our risk infrastructure, particular note was AML\/BSA, but we continue to make great progress on the aspects of the written agreement that we were obligated to and we're nearing completion of those activities. But we have to finish our work so that the Fed can come in and do their work and hopefully remove the written agreement from us. We don't have a timeline on when that might happen but we're always hopeful that it will be soon, but you can't really control that.","Could you repeat the question on Hudson City?","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Well, no, it was just the regulatory obligations around that. You kind of just answered that with that answer. But I guess my second question was really just once you clear those hurdles, could you be back out there looking at potential bank M&A, particularly given some of the headwinds some of the smaller banks in your markets could be facing?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, if you've watched us through the years, you know that we've always been a bank that grows through acquisition, but we do complement it with organic growth. I think for all the reasons that we talked about when we did the Hudson City merger, we think that New Jersey is an attractive footprint for us in terms of customers that are there, both business customers as well as consumers. And it's a natural fit with our franchise.","That said \u2013 and obviously with our capital levels, we're in a good capital position to do deals. All that said, we're not interested in doing a deal for a deal's sake. We're interested in doing things that are positive for our shareholders. And to us, that means accretive to earnings and capital and we'll be patient.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Great, thank you.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, no problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good morning.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Good morning.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Just wondering if you could talk about, with the CCAR authorization, I understand it's all sort of dependent on economic outlook, but is the idea that you sort of start off doing a quarter of the total authorization a quarter and then adjust as necessary as you go through the next 12 months? Or do you start off a little more cautious? Are the buybacks a little more front end loaded? How should we think about the pace of activity?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Probably the best way to think about it is split evenly over the course of the four quarters.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Okay. And then I wonder now that Hudson City is done and closed and you've had a little bit of time with it under your belt, just curious if there have been any surprises, what kind of the biggest takeaways are and where you see the greatest opportunity from here?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","I guess, there haven't really been a lot of surprises that we would note, at least anything that stands out. I think we feel that the spot we're at with Hudson City is about where we expected to be at this point, kind of 120 days post a system conversion. There's work to be done to get the branch teams up to speed, especially from a thrift, up to speed on the breadth of products that we offer as well as learning the systems and then getting used to a sales environment. So that's kind of proceeding as we would expect. And as we mentioned, that's why we feel comfortable that now we're kind of ready to start taking the step that we're ready to take on the deposit pricing.","And then for the commercial and business parts of the bank, we've been there actually with M&T bankers pretty much since shortly after the announcement date, so really our focus there has been to keep that group of people engaged. And since we got the deal done, they've been excited and have the ability now to work with the branches and offer more confidently the deposit side of the relationship. And then we've been out recruiting and we're trying to grow that business through people additions. I think the thing that we pay a lot of attention to is just like we pay a lot of attention to credit and we want to grow in that footprint. We're going to grow under the kind of terms and structure that we know is good business, so we're not going to rush it. And the same thing kind of applies to people, that we know that finding and adding to our teams, people that fit our culture and understand how we do business and think about relationship and think about good structure, it's more important to us that we get the right people on the teams rather than fill the spots quickly.","So, I feel really good about where we are. I think we're tracking to where we would expect to be. And we just got to manage the pace that we talked about a little bit earlier on, which is the pace at which those mortgages run off and the pace at which we grow the commercial balances to offset that. But overall we're very pleased with where things are.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great, thank you.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question in terms of the commercial pipelines. You were saying that they were Iargely unchanged quarter-over-quarter. I guess I'm curious how much of the commercial growth, if you break it out this way, has come from legacy Hudson City markets and how much of that is coming from legacy M&T markets? Because it would seem to me that with the recent conversion you \u2013 one would have thought that you might have had a somewhat stronger pipeline in the second quarter. And we've also heard from a couple of other banks that commercial demand has slowed a little bit from the start of the year. So, maybe just a little more color on the commercial demand.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Sure. Well, as you would expect, when you look at the New Jersey markets, the growth rates there on commercial loans are actually slightly higher than what you would see in the rest of the footprint. We kind of averaged, just get the number here, 38% growth in C&I this quarter, annualized. That's an annualized number. And 18% in commercial real estate in the quarter, which those are higher than what you would see in the footprint, but it's off a small base, right? So I think when you look at the total loan growth, we're pleased with how things are going in New Jersey. We are building the pipeline there and we are getting growth rates that are faster than what you would see across the rest of the footprint. But it takes time for the dollars to build, right? So the percentage of dollars of growth that New Jersey represents is still small and growing compared to the size of the legacy balances and footprint.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Doucette of KBW.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, Darren. Hey, this is Brian Klock. I had some technical difficulty there. So, can you hear me okay?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, they changed your name?","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","No, it's me. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to follow up on the margin side. It looks like the C&I loan yields after the fourth quarter, the December hike, you've seen a positive carry through into the first quarter, and then you had another eight basis points expansion in the second quarter. So is there still repricing going on or was there any sort of recovery that impacted the second quarter or what do you expect to see from the C&I loan yields going forward then?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There was a couple of big recoveries early in the second quarter, but I think when we look at pricing and loan yields, I guess I'd go back to what I mentioned before, that it feels like things are stabilizing and when we look at the yields of business \u2013 new business that have been originated, the yields bounce around a little bit but really have been pretty stable for about the last four months to six months. And obviously a lot of that's tied to LIBOR. So you've got to watch what's happening with LIBOR, which moves around a little bit, but overall pricing is pretty stable and I wouldn't expect to see big movements over the course of the coming quarters, either direction.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","So is there a sort of core margin, or the core C&I loan yield? Is it closer to the 3.39% from the first quarter, if you adjust for those recoveries? Or is it still something that's...","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's probably in \u2013 yes, yes.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes. No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you guys share with us, you pointed out in your quarterly numbers that your return on average common shareholders' equity was 8.38%, which generally is believed to be below most banks' cost of capital of around 9% to 10%. This company, pre-financial crisis, used to deliver ROEs of around 15%. Can you share with us how you expect \u2013 I know we're not expecting it to go back to 15% because of the increased capital levels, but can you share with us what you think you can do to get that above your cost of capital?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess I'd offer a couple of thoughts. We spend a lot of time thinking about return on tangible common because that's one of the key binding constraints in CCAR and we focus a lot on that. When you look at the capital levels of where we were pre-crisis and where we are now, they're at least double.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Correct.","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So two elements to managing or thinking about returns as we go forward. One obviously starts with the capital we carry to run the bank. So that was part of our CCAR announcement and our CCAR ask, and we'll be continuing to look at the volatility of our earnings and our charge-off levels and continue to work on our capital policies to make sure that we were adequately capitalized but not overly capitalized. And that will help.","The other thing that I guess we think about when we look at our return versus our cost of capital, when you look at the volatility of our charge-offs and you look at the volatility of our earnings, we would kind of think that our cost of capital will be towards the bottom end of the industry because our beta's lower. So when you look at that, we think our cost of capital would be below the average in the industry and we think that over time as we continue to make the changes to the business to improve profitability as well as return capital, that those would be the factors that we would be thinking about as we move the needle on returns up in a positive direction.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Following up on your comments on CCAR, I congratulate you for using the mulligan. We wish more banks would do that. I notice that, if I recall correctly, the amount of capital that was reduced because of the CCAR process was considerably higher this year than last year. I think it was over 600 basis points this year and last year it was just under 300 basis points, if I recall. What caused that to be so much greater this time? And second, if it was totally due to the Hudson City deal, should we expect as you integrate that further that that kind of reduction in capital should be reduced on a go-forward basis?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so, I guess a couple of thoughts on that. I'll be honest with you. I'm not as familiar with the 300 basis points and 600 basis points that you're mentioning, but I guess a couple of things that I think about. First off, if you think about the mulligan and how people use that, I guess I feel the need to kind of address that, that we didn't go into the process with the intention of using the mulligan. We followed our process and did our analysis of our PP&R and our capital levels under stress and we set our ask based on what we think is the target that we need to run the bank. I think what we saw is that there were some differences between our analysis and the Fed's and they built a process that gave people a chance to make an adjustment because they can see that they're looking at things differently than we are. They get to see the industry and we don't. And they built a process that I think is sound in allowing you to make that change.","So we were fortunate that it was in place and we used it. I think when you think about our returns over the last three years, if you add in this year and the prior two years, we'd still be towards the bottom end of returns in the industry and we were cautious leading into the Hudson City acquisition because there's always uncertainty when you're doing a deal and we didn't want to have any issues. I think if you look on a going forward, we kind of see where our earnings are going, where our PP&R is going. We'll continue to make progress on our models and our loss rates and I think looking at the balance sheet and as the balance sheet changes, we feel like our capital levels, even with this buyback, will be pretty good and depending on what happens over the course of the next year, we'll be looking to continue to bring those levels down closer to, I guess, closer to what our targets are, and\/or where we were when we passed CCAR over the prior couple of years.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thank you.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jill Shea of Credit Suisse.","Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks. Credit quality continues to be very strong and the provision run rate was down this quarter with the lower net charge-offs. Can you just touch on how you think about the total allowance percentage as you shift towards a more commercial loan mix over time and how we can think about the pace of reserve build as we look out?","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, sure. And I think if you look at the bank pre Hudson City, where the mix of earning assets was more commercially oriented, as the Hudson City mortgages run off, which tend to have a lower loss rate, and the portfolio shifts to be a little more commercially-oriented, both C&I and CRE, that over time will shift and the allowance for losses will likely shift as the mix shifts.","I think if you look at the quarter, charge-offs were very low for the quarter because we had a big recovery. I think if you look at how we feel about things going forward, the first quarter was probably a little high and the second quarter was probably a little low and we would expect to be somewhere in the middle of that as we go through at least the next couple quarters.","Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. I had a quick follow-up to Ken's line of questioning. Given your comments about modest earning asset growth and what you're doing on the liability side to defend the margin, can we see stability to maybe modest growth from that $863.8 million net interest income number ex any change in the yield curve? And also, maybe some more color on how you can manage the trust deposit volumes which is clearly bloating your cash. I think you alluded to that in your prepared remarks.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, so I guess starting with the net interest income. Over the next couple quarters, it's probably going to be tough to see any growth there just because of the rate or the expected rate of decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio from Hudson City. So that's a big hill for us to climb to get back to flat or positive. I think when you look at the margin itself, we think we've got some opportunity there that's in our control from the Hudson City time deposit book to bring that down to reduce the cost of funding the assets on the balance sheet and obviously we're seeing and expecting to see some continued growth on the commercial loan side.","As it relates to trust deposits, I guess we could do something to turn those deposits away but when we look at it, it's a good deal for us because it requires no equity and we park the money at the Fed. And I think Ren\u00e9 had mentioned on prior calls, but I'll just remind you that with some of our business in the trust side, we get paid either in fees or in deposits. And in the current environment, many people are choosing to pay us in deposits. So while it reduces the margin in the short-term, it's positive for net interest income and for earnings. So we don't get too fussed about where the margin prints because of what's going on with trust demand deposits.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Good morning.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A question on expenses. The guidance that you gave, the second half's going to be roughly equal to the first half ex the merger charges. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's probably a fair bit higher than what I was building in, maybe consensus was building in for second half. But when we think about 2017, obviously you get some further cost savings related to Hudson City, but are we also looking at more of a parallel shift higher in expenses in 2017, or just trying to think of if there's any offsets to the increase. Thanks.","Donald J. MacLeod - Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations","Yes, so here's how I think about it. When you look at the expense increases that are going on, I'll bucket them into a couple of categories. So if we start with savings from Hudson City, we've largely achieved that. There's maybe a little bit to come through the back half of the year, but it might take a little longer on some of those pieces as we work through ORE and expenses like that.","When you look at the run rate for the rest of the year, there's change in the deposit charge, the FDIC charge, and that will go up in the third quarter. We think it will start to move a little bit down in time as we change the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We've got some increases for events, I would call them, one of them being the change that we see happening in our marketplaces and what we'll spend on some advertising dollars to take advantage of that. And then we've got the other event that is going on and will through the end of the year which is the legal things that are happening.","So, those will elevate expenses for the back half of this year. I wouldn't expect them to carry on all through 2017, right? So the advertising we know pretty certain what will happen with that because there's a time limit to that. With the legal stuff, we know we have a trial date in January but those dates can change, so I don't want to get too crazy on that. But that's part of what's driving some of that expense.","When you look at the other places where we're investing, it continues to be in technology and that will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but that's some of where the increase was in this quarter and some of that will be continuing on through 2016, 2017.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your final question comes from Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Joseph Schiraldi - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Just one quick one. Just trying to get a sense on the potential for repricing deposits from Hudson City customers. How do we think about \u2013 in terms of if it's a customer, you look at it, you want to retain, do you expect you are going to continue to sort of operate this two-tier payment or pricing model or do you think it's going to be a much tougher conversation in terms of if you remain an M&T customer, you accept sort of M&T CD pricing? And I'm wondering just how far over the next 12 months we could see that repricing and how front loaded that would be over the next two quarters versus the next 12 months?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So I guess if you think about the conversation with these customers, it probably goes and ends one of three ways. So one way is we say to someone who's a CD only customer, here's the rate we're offering to people that only have CDs with us. That rate will be lower than what they're earning today and would be more in line with what we're likely offering in our existing markets. The customer can choose that or they can choose another alternative, which would be to broaden their relationship, maybe bring a checking account relationship with them where they have their paycheck deposited. And if they bring that to us, then their rate would stay roughly where it is, but we would get the benefit, if we add the low cost deposit from the checking account and that really opens up some fee income opportunities through debit card interchange that goes with checking accounts or other maintenance fees that go with those accounts.","And then the last option is if they don't like the rate that we're offering them standalone and they choose not to broaden their relationship with us, they may choose to leave and go elsewhere looking for a yield that suits their needs. And so what we'll see over time is we'll see probably a combination of two things. We'll see a decrease in the rate that we're paying and we'll also see a decrease in the balances that sit within those time accounts. And the combination of those two things is what will help reduce the interest expense and help manage some of that margin compression that we were talking about.","Frank Joseph Schiraldi - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Like I said before, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but when you look at the book, the vast majority of it, I think it's about a $12 billion book and three quarters of it we'll reprice over the course of the next 12 months. So there you're talking about $9 billion that we'll reprice over the course of the next 12 months. And I think there's a little bit of front loaded to the third quarter based on my recollection, but if you think about it, fairly evenly split across those quarters. That would be a good way to think about it.","Frank Joseph Schiraldi - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay and is the majority of that money, that $12 million, is that CD only customers right now or is that not the case?","Darren J. King - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess it's a good chunk of it. When we look at that portfolio, it's probably 75% to 80% single service and would be CD oriented. So that's \u2013 I'm just trying to think about it in balances and reflect on some of the numbers I've seen, but I don't have that exact information off the top of my head so I don't want to misquote.","Frank Joseph Schiraldi - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Don MacLeod","Thank you, Laurie, and good morning. I would like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link and then on the Events & Presentations link.","Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don. And good morning everyone. M&T's results for the first quarter largely reflect the continuation of the economic environment we've been operating in over the past 5 or 6 quarters and the financial trends that have emerged. ","The results are characterized by the following: strong year-over-year growth in net interest income reflecting continued expansion of the net interest margin combined with modestly lower loan balances as growth in commercial and consumer loans was offset by our continued run-off of the residential mortgage portfolio acquired in the merger with Hudson City. ","Fee revenues were comparatively stable, with trust fees continuing to be a highlight. We experienced our usual seasonal uptick in compensation related expenses during the first quarter associated with equity compensation and employee benefits cost. Aside from that, expenses continue to be well controlled. ","The credit environment remains very good to excellent. As announced in early February, M&T amended its capital plan for the 2017 CCAR cycle. After receiving no objection from the Federal Reserve, M&T's board of directors authorized an additional $745 million of share repurchases to be completed by the end of this year's second quarter. ","Let's look at the specific numbers for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.23 for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $2.01 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.12 in the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $353 million, compared with $322 million in the linked quarter and $349 million in the year ago quarter. ","On a GAAP basis, M&T's first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.22% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 9.15%. This compares with rates of 1.06% and 8.03% respectively in the previous quarter. ","Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter or after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $5 million or $0.03 per common share little change from the prior quarter. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur. ","M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization was $357 million, compared with $327 million in the linked quarter and $354 million in last year's first quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.26 for the recent quarter compared with $2.04 in 2017's fourth quarter and $2.15 in the first quarter of 2017. ","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.28% and 13.51% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.12% and 11.77% in the fourth quarter of 2017.","In accordance with the SEC\u2019s guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the first and fourth quarters of 2017 as well as the first quarter of 2018 were impacted by certain noteworthy items.","Included in the first quarter of 2017\u2019s results was an $18 million tax benefit that arose from accounting guidance for equity compensation. This amounted to $0.12 per common share.","Included in the last year\u2019s fourth quarter results was a contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation amounting to $44 million. That contribution equaled $27 million after-tax effect or $0.18 per common share. The contribution exceeded the $21 million of realized securities gains recognized during the fourth quarter. ","M&T\u2019s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was also impacted by changes to US corporate tax rates. M&T\u2019s provision for income taxes for the quarter was increased by approximately $85 million as a result of the tax law changes reflecting a revaluation of the corporation's net deferred tax assets. This amounted to approximately $0.56 per common share. In aggregate, these items lowered net income for the fourth quarter by $98 million or $0.65 per diluted common share.","During the recent quarter, M&T increased its reserve to litigations matters by $135 million to reflect the status of preexisting litigation. That increase on an after-tax basis reduced net income by $102 million or $0.68 of diluted earnings per common share. ","Also, during the first quarter of 2018 M&T received a cash distribution of $23 million from Bayview Lending Group which is reflected in other revenues from operations. This amounted to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.12 per diluted common share.","Similar to last year, M&T\u2019s results for the first quarter included $9 million tax benefit relating to the new accounting guidance for equity compensation. That amounted to $0.06 per diluted common share. That benefit coupled with the lower corporate income tax rate reduced M&T\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter to just shy of 23%.","Earlier, I note $21 million of realized security gains in last year\u2019s fourth quarter which arose primarily from the sale of a current -- of a portion of our JSD preferred stock holdings. ","Our results for the first quarter reflect a $9 million unrealized loss on our portfolio of equity securities primarily comprised of our remaining holdings of JSD preferred stock. New accounting guidance requires equity securities to be revalued through the income statement instead of through other comprehensive income. ","Looking ahead, impact from this accounting change on holdings of equity securities could result in some volatility in securities gains or losses. ","Turning to the balance sheet and to the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $980 million in the first quarter of 2018, little change from the linked quarter. The comparison with the prior quarter reflects the impact from two fewer days in the recent quarter partially offset by expansion of the net interest margin to 3.71% up 15 basis points from 3.56% in the linked quarter. The increase in short-term interest rates resulting from the fed's December and March rate actions added a benefit to the margin of as much as 9 basis points in 2018\u2019s first quarter. This was in excess of our projections as the LIBOR rate grows more rapidly than the Fed funds target rate.","A lower level of average balances of funds placed on deposit with the Fed had an estimated 4 basis point positive effect on the margin. The lower cash balances were primarily the result of some seasonal volatility in commercial deposits as well as fluctuations in trust-related deposits. As it is usual the today shorter first quarter, compared with the previous quarter reflected an estimated 2 basis point benefit to the margin arising from the impact of 30 over 360 interest basis assets.","Average loans declined by less than 1% compared with the previous quarter. Customers sentiment appears to be stronger while paydown activity seems to be slowing. Commercial real estate activity is picking up slightly. ","Looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat, compared with the linked quarter. Commercial real estate loans were up approximately 2% or roughly 6% annualized compared with the fourth quarter. Funding of construction loans was a primary driver. ","As noted, residential real estate loans which are largely comprised of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson city transaction continued the plan rate of paydown. The portfolio declined by some 4% or approximately 14% annualized consistent with previous quarters. Consumer loans were up 1% growth in indirect and recreation finance loans continue to outpace declines in home equity lines and loans. Regionally broken floor plan balances was offset by softness Encina activity elsewhere, and which was fairly uniform across our footprint while CRE demand was a little better in New Jersey upstate New York and our metro region, which includes New York City. Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 declined an estimated 3% compared with the fourth quarter. ","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $459 million in the first quarter, compared with $484 million in the prior quarter. As noted, the recent quarter included $9 million of unrealized securities losses while 2017's final quarter included $21 million of realized securities gains. As I noted, included in other revenue from operations for the recent quarter is a $23 million distribution from Bayview lending group. ","Mortgage banking revenues were $87 million in the recent quarter, compared with $96 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $625 million in the quarter, down about 10% from $696 million in the fourth quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were $62 million, essentially flat, compared with the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $26 million in the first quarter, compared with $34 million in the linked quarter reflecting seasonally lower originations activity. That comparable figure in the first quarter of 2017 was also $26 million.","Trust income was $131 million in the recent quarter, up from $130 million in the previous quarter and 9% above the $120 million earned in last year\u2019s first quarter. New business generation continues to be strong and results were aided by the appreciation in the equity markets. Service charges on deposit accounts were $105 million, down seasonally from $108 million in the fourth quarter.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were $927 million. The first quarter\u2019s operating expenses included a $135 million addition to the reserve for litigation matters, while last year's fourth quarter results included a $44 million contribution to the M &T charitable foundation. Operating expenses for the recent quarter also included $56 million of seasonally high compensation costs, related to the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement eligible employees. The HSA contribution, the impact of annual incentive compensation on the 401K match and FICA payments as well as the annual reset in FICA payments and unemployment insurance. Those same items amounted to an approximate $53 million increase in salaries and benefits and last year's first quarter. As usual, these seasonal factors will not recur as we enter the second quarter","Next, let's turn to Credit. Overall credit quality continues to be in line with our expectations, matching the benign trends seen over the past four years. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the first quarter, compared with 12 basis points in the fourth quarter, which included a higher level of recoveries from previously charged off loans. Charge-offs in last year's first quarter also equals 19 basis points. The provision for credit losses was $43 million in the recent quarter exceeding net charge-offs by $2 million. The allowance for credit losses was $1 billion at the end of March. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was unchanged at 1.16%. Nonaccrual loans decreased by $18 million at March 31, compared with the end of 2017. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans declined by 1 basis point ending the quarter at 0.99%.","Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were $235 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans $224 million for 95% were guaranteed by government related embassies.","Looking at capital. M&T's common equity tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.59% compared with 10.99% at the end of the fourth quarter, and which reflects earnings retention during the first quarter share repurchases and the impact from the net decline in end of period risk weighted assets. During the first quarter M&T repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $721 million. ","Turning to the outlook. Based on first quarter results, our outlook for 2018 remains consistent with what we've shared with you on the January conference call. To reiterate those thoughts, we expect 2018 overall to look much like 2017 with growth in total loans ranging from flat to a low-single digit pace. The net interest margin has widen following the December and March actions by the Fed and the market is expecting additional actions over the remainder of 2018. ","Based on the current level of interest rates and reflecting the impact of the interest rate hedges we entered into last year, we continue to estimate that hypothetical future 25 basis points increase in short term rates should result in a 5 to 8 basis points benefit to the net interest margin. This also embeds a series of assumptions on resultant deposit pricing reactivity for various deposit categories. So far, deposit pricing reactivity continues to be less than we have modeled. Based on those balance and margin assumptions, we expect modest year-over-year growth in net interest income. ","The higher interest rate environment has impacted residential mortgage loan originations both volumes and gain on sale margins. Residential mortgage banking revenues could be pressured absent our ability to acquire additional servicing or sub-servicing business. We do anticipate seasonal improvement in commercial mortgage banking revenues as the year progresses. The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains stable with growth in low to mid-single digits. ","Notwithstanding the addition to reserve for litigation matters, we expect low to nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2018 compared to last year. As noted, we expect the seasonal surge in salaries and benefits we saw in the first quarter to normalize in the second quarter. Our outlook for credit remains little changed. There are no apparent significant pressures on particular industries or geographies. However, one factor in most of the stress credits we're seeing at present is leverage. ","As to capital, we continue to execute on the 2017 capital plan with $475 million of repurchase capacity remaining through the end of second quarter. We have submitted our capital plan for the 2018 ECAR cycle to the Federal Reserve and await discuss testing results, which should be published late in the quarter. ","Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. ","Now, let's open up the call to questions. Before which Lorry will briefly review the instructions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. ","Ken Zerbe","I guess just starting with the loan growth. You mentioned that sentiment is picking up, [pay down just filling] but the guidance for loan growth still seems pretty, I mean I am going to say tepid for the flat single digit pace given the run-off for the resi-mortgages of course. When you look at first quarter numbers, I mean were you expecting first quarter to be fairly weak with a stronger half pick up? I am just trying to get a sense of if this trend is in line with your expectations for loan growth, because the industry loan growth as you probably can imagine is pretty weak overall.","Darren King","Sure, Ken. When -- what\u2019s happened in the first quarter is pretty consistent with how we expected the year would unfold. When we were looking at 2018 it was our view that the trends that we have seen in the back half of 2017 would start to moderate a little bit meaning that the paydowns would likely slow down a little bit but not enough for the originations to materially outrun them and we see kind of slower growth in the first half of the year and it would pick up in the back half of the year as the impact of the -- most importantly the tax changes goes through and businesses have a better sense of where GDP is heading and how they choose to invest. It seems like there has been more optimism within our customer base since the tax reform. I guess the only thing that\u2019s dampened that a little bit of late has been some of the trade and tariff conservation that\u2019s going on, and I think there\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty now based on those comments there or those actions that are ongoing. But overall the mood is definitely more positive than what we saw in the second half of last year and where the first quarter ended up is very consistent with our expectations that we had coming into 2018.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay, great. And then just second question. Could you just give a little more detail in terms of what those equity securities were in the year holding on balance sheet that drove some of the volatility? And I guess also the question is like why are you still holding them or what\u2019s the rational for holding them given that they will introduce additional earnings volatility going forward?","Darren King","So those equity securities are almost entirely [GSE] preferred so Fannie and Freddie, those are securities that we\u2019ve had since I think about 2007 and we wrote them down pretty dramatically in \u201809 or \u201810, I have to get the exact date for you, but they are pretty much fully written down. When we were going through the fourth quarter of last year and looking at the changes to the tax law, we sold down a substantial portion of those but we kept a little bit because of where the pricing had moved and where we thought the real value was. So, there\u2019s a little bit left over and it\u2019s down to an all book value maybe $18 million, no less than that $9 million, the current value I think is around $18 million. So, there\u2019s not a lot of downside in the valuation and if get some [GSE] reform we see investment will payoff down the road. ","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. ","John Pancari ","On the deposit side, just give us a little more color on the decline in the non-interesting bearing. How much of that was seasonal factor and how much of it was just the trend through the quarter and how much of that expected in terms of that type of move? Thanks. ","Darren King","So, John on deposit balances and movements in the quarter there are three factors, one of the trust-related and two of them related to commercial. So, trust demand balances as you guys know move around quite a bit depending on the activity in the capital markets and it was a little bit slower in the first quarter than what we had seen in the fourth quarter which that moves a reasonable amount from one quarter to the next depending on what\u2019s going on. Within the commercial book we do see a seasonal decline in commercial deposit balances usually every first quarter, what tends to happen as commercial companies will build up their deposit balances going into the fourth quarter as they prepare for their distributions to their principles and to employees, and as that gets paid out you see those balances go down. We are starting to see a little bit more interest in suite balances, as rates have moved up, corporate treasures have shown a little more interest in managing the return that they're getting on their balances, you\u2019re seeing that in some movement into suite and discussions about that, some movements and rates and the combination of those two things commercial, and trust-related deposits that move the non-interest-bearing down in the first quarter. ","As we look forward, we also see in some of our interest-bearing checking accounts, likely some movement there in the future quarters related to escrow balances where we are expecting some of those escrow balances to move from M&T to other organizations which those balances we pay pretty much Fed funds on them and so will replace them with a like deposit instrument at a similar cost so we are not anticipating any change materially to our cost of funds, but there will be some geography movement in terms of where the balances fit on the balance sheet the in future quarters.","John Pancari ","And then secondly on the expense side, I know, in terms of your outlook you mentioned nominal growth there. I think you had previously indicated approximately 2% are so give or take in terms of year-over-year expense growth for the year of 18\u2019 is that still intact is that the best way to think about nominal?","Darren King","That's the best way to think about it John and when we talked about this on the fourth quarter so whole of the litigation reserve to decide. What we had talked about was kind of what we would describe as normal quarterly expenses which tend to appear most in the second and third quarter. And if you annualize those and kind of grew those around 2% and then add-on the seasonal compensation cost that we just discussed and happen in the first quarter, which they always do that was the math behind the expense number and the target. ","John Pancari ","So, the positive operating leverage expectations are still impacting?","Darren King","The positive operating leverage expectations is certainly intact. ","John Pancari ","Operator","Your next question comes from Kenneth Usdin of Jefferies. ","Kenneth Usdin","If I could just follow on, on the balance sheet. John would you given that there is still some remixing to your point about the deposits. Do you think that this quarter kind of mark the bottom for the average earning asset base given that flush out that you would had and some of your points about some of the ins and outs that might go forward [next to that] earning assets growth from here or is it still a net down that could still happen?","Darren King","So, Ken, when you think about the earning assets, it can be a little tricky quarter-to-quarter just because of the dollars that sit at the fed that are trust related and we\u2019ve seen some large moves quarter-to-quarter on those that they can move by $1 billion or $2 billion at the end of 2016. They actually move by $2 billion or $3 billion a quarter. So, if we hold those to the site because they are a little bit less predictable and we just look at the lending and loan balances were close to the bottom. I don't know that we are quite there yet but we are close. And the reason I'm not quite calling the bottom right now is depending on the rate of pickup in commercial loan growth. So, we saw some nice uptick in commercial real estate balances this quarter and we saw C&I balances kind of flatten out which is a good thing, but in aggregate, we've got the runoff of that residential real estate portfolio. And just the normal amortization and paydown, which looks like we've been seeing over the last few quarters around 13% to 14% annualized until that portfolio gets a little bit smaller the dollars that we need to add in other categories meaning in C&I and CRE or another consumer loans needs to be $600 million a quarter is for us to see absolute growth in total loan balances. And it's the combination of those factors. I think we are close. If we get a little bit more uptick in investing activity in our commercial customers and commercial real estate then I think we will see that turn sooner. And if not then we will probably be flattish through the year, which is why we gave the overall guidance for the year of flat to kind of low single-digits.","Kenneth Usdin","And as a follow up to that you know you mentioned expectation for a modest NII growth, but even with the FTE adjustment delta you are up six and change already just based on this December-hike pulling through. So, if we continue to get the fed funds curve move forward and the type of pull through on that 5 to 8 basis points, it seems that you could do decently better than quite modest, I don\u2019t know if you can help us talk through a zone of expectations on that front door to an extent will be helpful.","Darren King","Sure, as we look forward at the net interest income and future fed moves, what's left in the forward curves today I think is an increase in late summer, mid to late summer and one right at the end of the year. So, the one of the end of the year will have not a material impact on our net interest income for the year. So, there is one more rate increase. I think when we originally came into 2018, we were expecting two; one of which we thought would happen in January and it happened in December, so the rate of increase in fed funds rates is a little bit faster than what we thought. And as long as we can maintain loan balances in line with the guidance that we gave and what we have seen so far there is probably a little bit more upside in net interest income. But I wouldn't think a ton. We don\u2019t anticipate seeing as much of a gain in dollars and net interest income in 2018 as we saw in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I was wonder if you could talk a bit about your technology spend and just kind of thoughts on whether you have to further ramp it up listen out the next couple years. And obviously your [cost signs] this year was pretty clear as that was relatively flat, extra-legal charge. But just conceptually how you think about investment spend as you look out the next couple of years.","Darren King","Sure. So, technology spend has been increasing at the bank pretty consistently for the last 3 to 5 years certainly over the last 4. When we look back at where we have spent in our trajectory into 2018. In total, our IT spend has been growing 10% to 13% a year. That's both on new technology as well as on maintaining plant and equipment. When you think about the categories that we're investing in, is very broad. I tend to think about it in terms of customer facing tools that we're investing in, we've talked about our mobile app and upgrades we've made to the mobile app and the website. This year we'll see Zelle go live late second quarter early third quarter. We're making some improvements to the tools that our commercial customers use for their cash management. So, things to help make it easier for customers to work with the bank. We're investing in employee enabling tools, we're making major investment in our commercial loan origination systems, which are intended to help the RMs spend less time in front of their computers doing loan spreads and putting packages together and get them more time to be with customers helping advise them on their business needs. ","In the consumer space, we're improving our account opening tools and procedures so that the amount of time it takes to open the checking account or credit card account can be dramatically reduced so that our team members can spend more time giving advice to customer during that interaction rather than taking information and preparing the application. And then there is investments that we're making in infrastructure that we need to make just because we're a bank. We've been investing a lot in data quality and our data warehouse. We of course invest in privacy and cybersecurity to make sure that we're buttoned down. And when you add up investments along those dimensions, that's where we've been investing our technology dollars and will continue to. ","What has been happening though, it's a wash in the expense numbers is that as we make those improvements or we think those investments there are other parts of the bank where we're becoming more efficient. Where it changes the process and business model are helping us reduce our costs and therefore you don't see it's clearly in the numbers the big spike in technology investment. ","And I think the other thing that we've talked about before is you don't tend to see that big spike, because for us, we are very measured in the space at which we deploy new technology and we find that that's an important way to minimize the risk and it minimizes risk in two fashions the less change you introduced to the system or at least more measured you are. If something goes wrong, it's easy to correct and fix and identify. Because there is only a couple of things that have changed in any given time. And the other important aspect of risk management is the change that you introduced to your employees and to your customers. Too much change all at once can cause service disruptions or can cause short term pain while employees adapt to the new way of doing business. And for that reason, we try to be very measured and consistent in terms of the pace in which we're investing in and deploying new technology. ","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, if you look at your CET 1 obviously very strong at 10.6. And just what are your thoughts in terms of where you need to be longer term kind of in this new regulatory environment that we're in. That seems like there is been some soft thing for banks enjoying in particular for you, for banks your size and risk profile.","Darren King","Sure. So, where we sit with our CET1 ratio today is I would say middle-ish of the peer group based on where we saw everyone\u2019s CET1 ratios through the end of last year. And we\u2019ve talked about for the last few years, our objective is to operate towards the bottom end of that peer range. That\u2019s a bit of a moving target. But when we look at as you pointed out, our business model and the strength and lack of volatility in our earnings, we think that that\u2019s a good targeted place for us to be. As the rules get sorted out and the changes come through as we see the changes that were proposed by the fed last week as well as the bill in the house right now, as more clarity comes from those bills and the direction, we will obviously continue to asses where we are operating and what we think makes sense for M&T.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos ","I wanted first follow-up on C&I. When you talk to your C&I customers what are they saying that they are likely to do in the short run from the benefit of the lower tax rate? And are they at least signaling that an increase in CapEx and investments coming at some point?","Darren King","Sure. So, based on our conversations with our C&I customers in particular over the last 90 or so days, we mentioned that there\u2019s been a definite movement up in terms of their optimism and there has been more discussion with our relationship managers about investment in property, plant and equipment. So those discussions are starting which I take as a positive sign because that hadn\u2019t been the case during 2017 and before. So, I think there\u2019s a little bit more optimism that GDP growth rates will stick where they are at least for a long enough time horizon to get customers comfortable, making those investments and adding back that fixed expense so to speak to their income statements. ","So definitely a little more positivity and we\u2019re optimistic that that will translate into some more loan demand as we go through the year. ","Steven Alexopoulos ","And are you seeing an increase -- maybe [drawing a line] but an increase in commitment to wanting to get the lines in place at this point?","Darren King","During the quarter we saw some uptick in commitments, probably saw a little more increase in the rate of utilization and then the rate of commitment during the first quarter but that\u2019s not atypical. ","Steven Alexopoulos ","And then second one on the deposit side. You saw very modest increase in deposit cost again in the quarter. I saw a few other banks indicating, they are starting to see deposit competition stepping up a bit here. Are you seeing a shift in the environment and what you\u2019ll need to pay on deposits? Thanks. ","Darren King","Sure. Deposits competition I would say is starting to show signs of moving. It depends again on which category we\u2019re looking at. If we look at our wealth business and affluent customers, pricing has mattered to them and their advisors for a long period of time and nothing is really new there other than the absolute rate as the -- as fed funds move. ","In the commercial space, we are definitely seeing business treasures thinking a lot more about how they're getting paid for their excess balances and there is more conversation about what kind of earnings credit rates are appropriate given the balances that they have and the discussions of moving more balances and the suite is those conversations are happening more frequently than they were two quarters ago. So, you can see, you can see that coming. ","On the consumer side when we look at what's going on there. There continues to be less action in interest checking and savings and decidedly less in the money market space with the exception of the online banks, but that from our experience is pretty typical for this point in the cycle that when rates start to move up the action tends to be in certificates of deposit, and that's where we've kind of seen most of the competition we\u2019ve talked a little bit about that over the last couple of quarters, that so far the price competition has tended to be at the shorter end of the curve where there is some steepness, it\u2019s tended to be 12 months or less we start to see a little bit of creep towards 18 months CD prices, but otherwise not much at the longer end of the curve, given the relative flatness of it, so those are kind of the places I think we\u2019re starting to see it and when we run our sensitivity models we think in 25 basis point increments, so we are about where we thought we'd be maybe slightly slower with the last 25 basis points, but you can definitely feel things are starting to get little closer to when we'll see a turn.","Steven Alexopoulos ","If that\u2019s the case your new responses been at the upper end typically of the 5 to 8 basis points in response to fed move. Do you think we start moving towards the lower end of that range?","Darren King","I think each one is appearing to be unique on to itself but we continue to believe that somewhere in that range is the right place for the next 25 and likely the 25 after that if something changes will let you know but, I think that\u2019s a good expectation. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","My first question is a follow-up on the excess capital question. As you think by where the stock is trading today on book. How should we think about how M&T's thinking on buybacks are evolving as evaluation changes and maybe I better like to ask it is. Could you help us give us sense of what your IRR is or earn back period is on your stock buybacks at current levels?","Darren King","Sure. I guess as we look at our capital position and we think about where we sit, well we start from a macro perspective, which is we want to deploy that capital obviously in the business. And the best way to deploy it is through customer growth and loan growth, which we know where that's been through the last few quarters, although we did see some uptick we always think about how much capital will need not just but what we have on the balance sheet today but future growth. ","And then after that we have access and the question then is how best to deploy between dividends and share repurchases or special dividend, when you look at our dividend rate now its set to increase by $0.05 per share this quarter that was approved in last year's capital plan. But after the tax rate changes our dividend payout ratio is going to be below probably 20% around 25% maybe slightly below 25% and we have historically been higher than that in kind of 27% to 33% range. So, we should expect some movement there. ","And then we've got what's left over, but we've never been an organization that has held onto excess capital just in case. And if there is no loan growth then the only other place to deploy it is on M&A, and given the prices of other organizations and the risk involved that we think is a better risk return trade-off right now for us to buy back our own stock than it is to either sit on it or go chasing Phil advised deals. And so that's how we think through our buyback from the top of the house and where we get to on our decision to deploy and to buy.","Erika Najarian","And just to hold up all the margin questions that you have got. Could you remind us on the asset side? Your wholesale a variable-rate exposure is the benchmark rate more one month or three-month LIBOR, and while its small for you I\u2019m also wondering on the long-term borrowing side. If some of that in exposure has been swapped out to floating rate and if so, if its one months or three months LIBOR?","Darren King","Sure, so on the debt side that easy, it\u2019s all been swapped, the floating and it\u2019s based on three months. And when you look at the asset side of the balance sheet, generally our book is priced off a one-month LIBOR. There are some consumer loans. Obviously, they're priced off of prime which is really fed funds. But one-month LIBOR tends to be the pricing basis for other loans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","When you were talking about credit you touched on beverages being driver of the issues that you haven\u2019t seen even though at this they are pretty infrequent. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that leverage comment? What specific you have been saying?","Darren King","Sure, so if you were happen to read Renee's letter to shareholders we talked a lot -- he talked a lot in the letter about changes that are happening in the structure of the market and covenant reductions and leverage. And when we have gone through our credit which we do at the end of every month and look at the various situations that are challenged, leverage has tended to be a place where we haven\u2019t charged anything off but that\u2019s where things are criticized and where we have got an eye on it and it tends to be where the credit EBITDA and a debt service coverage ratios are moving into a range where there is certainly above what you would think or where we've seen traditionally our book and on both of those measures. And that's really where the comment came from -- that\u2019s further things that we are seeing. That\u2019s the common theme and it's not inconsistent with some of our observations about the macro market in general. Just thankfully we have lesser than our book than the average.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then maybe following up on that. Do you guys have a sense of where you think we are in the macro cycle? I know it\u2019s clearly somebody that matters a lot to you, there are indicators that you watch internally that you think are helpful in giving a steer on that that you can talk about.","Darren King","I guess, there is not a specific internal measure that we look at and say we're early mid or late in the cycle. But I'll give you some thoughts, because it's a source of internal debate about where we are. And I think some of the macro signals are given us different messages about where we are in the cycle. So, the number one thing that has always kept us out of trouble and kept our charge us where they are is our focus on returns. And because we think about returns when we're looking at and evaluating credit decisions, we need to get comfortable with the risk reward for the decisions that we're making. And we've seen some challenges in that over the last six months seems like things go little bit better after-tax reform. But when we were looking at pricing, and covenants and collateral levels, there was some signal things or things are getting a little bit challenged. ","When you compare that to where GDP is and how much of a rebound there has been and just total economic activity since the last recession, this recovery is still not all the way back and to what you would see typically post-recession. But when you look at the time since the recession it would suggest that we're way far along and that we're towards the end. So, we've got some signal saying, we still got room to go when obviously we've got the backdrop of the stimulus that's happened from Washington on the positive side meaning there is still some room to run. And then when you look at where spreads are moving and where covenants are moving, these things tend to happen later in the cycle when people start grasping for growth. So that's the thought process and the observations that we have behind where we are in the cycle. Our own view is probably we're at least mid and moving towards late, but I don't think we're all the way to the late get probably got extended a little bit given the changes that recently have gone through in Washington. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ","Brian Klock ","So, Daren sorry I have another question on the guidance around NII. So, I think when you guys give guidance for the full year on the fourth quarter call. You said about 3% was the sort of year-over-year modest NII growth, is that the same level that we should do think about when you say modest year-over-year growth?","Darren King","I think when we gave that we were anticipating a slightly slower rate of increase in Fed funds and therefore what we might see on margin expansion. When we look over the course of the year, I guess we're probably thinking 3% to 4%, probably more like 4% now given where rates have gone offset a little bit by flattish balance sheet which Fed expectation isn't changed that much from where we are at the end of the year and a little more positive on net interest margin given where Fed funds has gone and is projected to go. ","Brian Klock ","Got it and that make sense. And then I guess follow up to that. Average assets obviously you talked about some of the movement in with some of the trust deposits et cetera. But the expectation was today you said average loan growth to be flat to slightly up. Do we still think average earnings assets could be flat year-over-year?","Darren King","It\u2019s a tough one to handicap Brian, just because of the movement in that one category of assets that are putting it to set. And those relate to trust demand which is really a function of market activity that we have within our -- with the businesses and our global capital markets business and that\u2019s really what adds a lot of volatility to the total assets picture. I guess the good news is when those assets drop, the margin goes up, but obviously the reverse is true. When you look at their impact on NII it\u2019s really not that great and really where we spend most of our time watching is the core loans and the loan categories and where we anticipate that coming out over the course of the year and that\u2019s really where we expect that flat to modest increase back end weighted like we\u2019ve been talking about today in January.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter ","End of period loans were still slightly below the first quarter average. And I am just wondering if you could talk about what loan growth in the month of March?","Darren King","So, our loan growth in the quarter was pretty consistent with what was in the H8 data from the fed, in that it was a little bit back end loaded, a little bit better in March than we saw in January and February. Now you can get some movement in end of period balances depending on some business that sits within real estate reality capital corp where assets are waiting to go off to Fannie and Freddie, and that can cause some end of period fluctuation. But overall during the quarter we saw progressively better loan growth particularly in C&I as the quarter went on.","Peter Winter ","And just very quickly, will the tax rate go back to that range of 25% to 26% going forward?","Darren King","Yes. Over the course of the year we think that\u2019s a good range. Obviously, we gave that range because we\u2019re -- the effects and specifics of the tax changes were unknown and this quarter was impacted by that accounting change that actually went into effect last year. But otherwise we think that\u2019s still appropriate range we\u2019d thinking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby ","Thanks. A quick statement then a question. I think you changed their pill around a lot on the margin and balance sheet when in reality you just have transient deposits that go in and out, my margin was up by 10 basis points but my earning assets were too high. And so, once you make that adjustment our NII number was exactly what it was, what you came out with this quarter. So, it really is just the kind of pop in and out but then create incremental very low yielding low spread kind of assets that mess with the margin but not net interest income. Then my question is you got my 40% of your funding that comes from free funds which is one of the highest months for our coverage and if you look at that on the bottom of your rate paid, your contribution of interest-free funds it was 19 basis points last year that\u2019s up to of 24 basis points this year, is that 5 basis points which I think has been a positive and we continue to be a positive lift to your margin included in this kind of 25 basis points fed gives you 5 to 8 basis points or is that kind of a lagging effect that you get after-the-fact as your asset yields roll higher?","Darren King","Marty, thanks for the statement, you nailed it with that comment about the relationship between the margin and the earning assets. As it relates to the contribution of interest-free funds that's something that we think about when we are going through our asset liability models and sensitivity and it is factored into the 5 to 8. The impact you see down here is the effect after all the changes that happen in the other categories and calculated into the net interest margin, that effect will obviously change quarter-to-quarter depending on what percentage of the funding those balances make up. And as you pointed out we\u2019ve got a very strong percentage of the balance sheet that\u2019s sitting in non-interest-bearing deposits, a function of our strong commercial balances as well as some of those trust demand balances that will go in there go in there and move around from quarter-to-quarter. When we look at that on a go forward basis and we think about it in our asset liability modeling and our sensitivity we have probably spend more time there thinking about will those balances shift into other categories like sweep or interest-bearing as opposed to paying a price there paying rate specifically for them, and that\u2019s how it gets factored into that 5 to 8. ","Marty Mosby ","No, it just can take longer from that to be realized and that 5 to 8 kind of feels like into 10 years next quarter kind of projection so it could be that we are getting just a little bit more towards up into that range because some of this is still spilling over from our prior hikes that we\u2019re getting down the road but thanks and appreciate the feedback. ","Darren King","I think there is a little of that Marty and I think don\u2019t forget the other thing that happened this quarter. In particular, was how one-months LIBOR moved so far in advance of fed funds that also helps in a good way, which is above that target range that range that we had given as a rule of thumb. I think without that we probably would have been more like the eight as if certainly not all the way down to the five for some of the reasons that you decided but that had a positive impact on the margin this quarter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Martinez with UBS.","Paul Martinez","Just building on the commentary on leverage and I guess it\u2019s bit of a broader question but to what extent is elevated leverage amongst commercial borrowers already negatively impacting credit demand and limiting the extent to which loan growth rebounds, or can it limit the extent of loan growth rebounds even if we do see pay downs normalize even if we do see the economy and GDP growth perk up and CapEx pick up. Are we at a level where or are we at a point where maybe commercial loan growth, is more subdued than nominal GDP growth because leverage has built up in the economy over a number of years.","Darren King","It\u2019s a great macroeconomic question, I think when you look at the banks versus the nonbanks the rules on leverage and what\u2019s considered in HLC by the feds would have pushed a lot of the leverage that might have existed in the banking system, into the nonbanking system, since the rules changed. How much that's impacting loan growth? Perhaps at the higher end of the C&I spectrum where they were tended to access the public markets and the capital markets to issue bonds and use leverage. I think as you move down the spectrum you would tend to see a little bit less of that impacting demand, but obviously the big balances come from those larger customers. So, you are probably on the right track with your thesis of overall loan growth being impacted by that because of the impact of the bigger customers and bigger balances. It probably makes sense that when you look at where loan growth, is large banks versus small banks in the H8 that I\u2019m sure part of the reason why you see that difference in growth rate in those two categories.","Paul Martinez","I guess a little bit more of a mundane question. Any update on the runoff of the higher costs Hudson City deposits where we are in that process and how much of the I guess a tailwind from a funding cost standpoint there is still left?","Darren King","Sure, we are getting largely through that portfolio. We are down to about 25% of our Hudson City related time deposits that have yet to reprice. So, we are three quarters of the way through that. And what's interesting is when you look at the movement in fed funds and the slow increase in the price we are paying or the rate we are paying on what we will call legacy or non-Hudson City time deposits that are creeping up, and the Hudson City ones have creeping down and we are almost at the point where they are in sync. And so, there's probably a little bit more tailwind on Hudson City deposits and their impact on our total cost of funds but we are getting to the point where those two are going to converge. And likely at some point this year we will see time deposits bottom out and start to go the other way just because where we are in the rate cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","If we take a look at your history, you've done a great job in making acquisitions and I know there are opportunistic and episodic, but can you give us some color on what you're seeing out there for potential acquisitions. I know you guys don't get into bidding or auction wars or so on and so forth. But what you guys feel and what you're seeing from an opportunity to maybe to be able to get back into mergers and acquisitions in the next 12 to 18 months?","Darren King","We are certainly hopeful that the market starts to come back from what we see and hear there's some discussions, but nothing that really seemed serious at this point. I think there are remains to be remains a bit of a discrepancy between seller expectations versus buyer expectations with regard to price. And that's probably not unreasonable given where we are in the credit cycle and the rate cycle. I think that credits are as good as it's going to be. But everyone thinks that will continue on forever. And rates are going up and margins continue to expand. So, people feeling pretty good about their prospects for the future, which is impacting the price they might be willing to accept to partner with M&T or any other buyer for that matter. So, we're certainly hoping to get back in the game. But as Bob always said, and those words bring clear, thanks to -- and then willing seller for something to happen. And based on where things are right now things like there will be continuing discussions. But I suspect not a lot of actions in the short term. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Spahr or Wells Fargo. ","Christopher Spahr","Thank you for taking the question. This is regarding your technology strategy and your measured approach. Can you compare that to your approach with the AML issue? Are you using a lot of in house or third-party people to kind of execute that? And a follow up question, can you give some metrics so that we can see the progress such as the remainder of users that are active online or mobile users. Thank you. ","Darren King","Sure. So, when you think about how we execute technology projects, we have a combination of in house resources and outside contractors. And the mix is probably around 60-40, 60% inside 40% outside. But that can vary dramatically on the nature of the project that's being worked on. There are some instances where it might be newer technology where we need to augment our team with more outside expertise and then part of the mission of the project is to have knowledge transferred from the outside party to inside. And then there is other ones where it's primarily inside. And it's an existing system, where we have folks that have been caring, feeding of that system over the years and those upgrades or changes and enhancements will be done primarily with inside folks. ","As you look out at everything that\u2019s going on in the world and the pace of change. I think it was also a common in Rene's Shareholder Letter that we're thinking little bit more about outside partnerships and evaluating those as a way to move a little bit more quickly. And so there you would see slightly different mix than we might have in the past between inside and outside resources. But in general, 60-40 is probably a good way to think about it. And when I think about mobile adoption, which is around that why that done get back to -- what the exact number is, but our mobile adoption rates continue to grow each quarter. I want to say we're in the mid-30% of active check in account users that are active on mobile and active when they'll sign on more than once in a month. What we can go back and we'll get some more exact figures on that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill. ","Frank Schiraldi ","Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. I just wondered if you had any or give any color on geographic trends you seen in loan growth in the quarter. Any surprises there in terms of where you're seeing a loan growth either positive or negative?","Darren King","We had some -- when we look at loan growth by geography, both C&I and CRE, we didn\u2019t really see a ton of difference by geography for C&I. For CRE we saw a little bit of more growth in New Jersey and upstate New York and in metro or New York City. I guess when we looked more by industry or type rather than by geography that\u2019s where we saw some interesting trends. We see continued demand for warehouse space for multi-family and also growth in assisted living and skilled nursing. ","And I guess when we stood back after we went through those and thought about some of the macro trends that are going on it actually made a lot of sense, that has retail that gets impacted and business shifts to the Internet, that warehouse capacity is more in demand because that\u2019s how customer needs are being fulfilled. As the population ages, obviously, a little bit more assisted living and skilled nursing. And then one of the other macro trends that continue is people back into urban centers, particularly the millennials and empty nesters, and that\u2019s driving demand for multi-family. So really kind of made a lot of sense to us when we look back at where the -- where some of the action was.","Frank Schiraldi ","Okay, great. And then just finally wondered if you could give any color on what I call sort of the non-core items in the quarter. The increase in the litigation reserve was fairly sizable, I thought, especially given recent disclosure in the 10-K in terms of potential liability from ongoing litigation? And then secondly just the Bayview distribution, if we should just look at that really as just a one-off here? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So, on the litigation expense, I really don\u2019t have any other comment on that other than what we said earlier in the call and in the earnings release as it relates to ongoing matters. So, we won't comment on that. When you look at the Bayview distribution, that was a distribution that we hope will happen on annual basis but it\u2019s going to be based on the performance of that organization. We have an ownership stake. And as the make distributions to the other partners, we get a proportional distribution as well. We are hopeful that it will -- that they will continue but the timing and the magnitude are hard to predict.","Frank Schiraldi ","Does that distribution come back or the positive outcome I guess you saw in the distribution this year, is that reflective of the securitization market coming back and their core business coming back for Bayview?","Darren King","No, not really, when you look at Bayview over the course of the last decade I guess since the change in the financial crisis, they\u2019ve kind of reinvested themselves in how they run their business. They took a lot of the expertise that they had in mortgage lending and changed it into other related activities, and that\u2019s part of what we are seeing in the turnaround and their results, and therefore in us receiving the distribution.

I'd like to thank you for participating in M&T's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the web cast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our web site, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.","Before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. As we noted in the earnings press release this morning, M&T's results for the third quarter continued to reflect solid performance in the current operating environment. We saw further expansion of the net interest margin and decent growth in net interest income. Consistent with the trends we have seen over the course of 2017, loan growth remained a challenge.","Fee revenues were solid, and core expenses continue to be well controlled. Credit remains stable, with charge-offs at the best levels of the current credit cycle. And M&T's capital levels are strong, even as we execute our 2017 capital plan.","Looking at the numbers; diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.21 in the third quarter of 2017, down 6% from $2.35 in the second quarter of 2017 -- excuse me, we were at $2.21 in the third quarter, $2.35 in the second quarter. The third quarter results are up 5% from $2.10 in the third quarter of 2016.","Net income for the quarter was $356 million compared to $381 million in the linked quarter and $350 million in the year ago quarter.","Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter or after-tax expenses from amortization of intangible assets amounting to $5 million or $0.03 per common share. Little change from the prior quarter.","Consistent with our long term practice, M&T provides supplemental reports on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.","M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger related expenses from the relevant periods was $361 million, compared with $386 million in the linked quarter and $356 million in last year's third quarter.","Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.24 for the recent quarter, a decrease of 6% from $2.38 in 2017's second quarter and up 5% from $2.13 in the third quarter of 2016.","On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.18% and an annualized return on average common equity of 8.89%. This compares with rates of 1.27% and 9.67% respectively in the previous quarter.","Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder's equity of 1.25% and 13.03% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.33% and 14.18% in the second quarter of 2017.","In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the third quarters of 2017 and 2016 were impacted by certain noteworthy items.","On October 9th, Wilmington Trust Corporation reached a settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware, that required a $44 million payment that was not deductible for income tax purposes. As of September 30, we increased the reserve for legal matters by $50 million. That increase, coupled with the non-deductible nature of the $44 million payment reduced M&T's net income in the recent quarter by nearly $48 million or $0.31 of diluted earnings per common share.","In addition, recall that the results of the third quarter of 2016 included $28 million of net pre-tax securities gains, that equated to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. Those gains pertain to a variety of TruP CDOs, the required divestiture under the so-called Volcker rule.","Turning our attention to the balance sheet and the income statement; taxable equivalent net interest income was $966 million in the third quarter of 2017, improved by $19 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin improved to 3.53%, up 8 basis points from 3.45% in the linked quarter. As was the case last quarter, the wider margin was predominantly driven by the full quarter impact from the Fed's mid-June action to increase short term interest rates.","Average loans were down approximately 1% to the linked quarter. Looking at loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, we saw commercial and industrial loans were about 3% lower than in the linked quarter. That included $228 million of seasonal decline in loans to auto dealers to finance their inventories. Excluding the floor plan loans, C&I balances were down some $388 million or approximately 2%.","Commercial real estate loans were roughly flat with the second quarter. We continue to allow our portfolio of residential mortgage loans to pay down without replacement. As a result, the portfolio declined by 3%, consistent with previous quarters.","Consumer loans were up 3%. As has been the case for some time now, growth in indirect auto and recreation financed loans are outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans.","Regionally, we saw paydown activity in the C&I portfolio, distributed fairly broadly across our footprint, as well as across industries. While the commercial real estate portfolio was flat, we experienced declines in our East Coast markets, which include New York City and Washington DC. The primary driver of those declines was construction loans being taken out with permanent financing from other mostly non-bank lenders, and condo loans being repaid through the sales of the properties. Offsetting those declines was growth in our upstate New York and New Jersey regions.","Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, brokered deposits and CDs over $250,000 were some $1.1 billion lower than the second quarter. Primarily reflecting the continued run-off of high rate time deposits acquired with Hudson City.","It's interesting to note that our cost of interest bearing deposits is up by just 2 basis points for the year-to-date 2017 compared with the same period last year.","Looking at non-interest income; non-interest income remained strong at $459 million in the third quarter, little changed from $461 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $97 million in the recent quarter, improved from $86 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $757 million in the quarter, down about 2% compared with the second quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities were $63 million, improved from $61 million the prior quarter.","Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $34 million in the recent quarter, up $9 million from the prior quarter, reflecting higher volumes of loans originated for sale and the associated gain on sale revenues.","Trust income was $125 million in the recent quarter, compared with $127 million in the second quarter and recall that included in the second quarter are approximately $4 million of seasonal tax preparation fees.","Service charges on deposit accounts were $109 million, improved by $4 million compared with the second quarter, reflecting seasonally higher levels of customer activity.","Other non-interest revenues declined by about $10 million compared with the prior quarter, reflecting lower levels of commercial loan fees, predominantly syndication fees.","Turning to expenses; operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $798 million compared with $743 million in the previous quarter. Salaries and benefits were essentially unchanged from the prior quarter at $399 million. Notwithstanding the legal related costs I mentioned earlier, other expense categories remain well controlled. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains in last year's third quarter from the denominator was 56% in the recent quarter compared with 52.7% in the previous quarter and 55.9% in 2016's third quarter.","Looking at credit; our credit metrics continue to be relatively stable. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $25 million compared with $45 million in the second quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 11 basis points for the third quarter, improved from 20 basis points in the second quarter. The provision for credit losses was $30 million in the recent quarter, exceeding charge-offs by $5 million. The allowance for credit losses was approximately $1 billion at the end of September. The ratio of the allowance to total loans increased slightly to 1.15%.","Non-accrual loans declined slightly at September 30th compared with the end of the prior quarter, but the decline of end of period loans resulted in a 1 basis point increase in the ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans, and in the quarter, at 0.99%, just under 1%.","Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding loans that have been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $261 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $252 million or 97% are guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital, during the third quarter, we began implementation of our 2017 CCAR capital plan. Repurchasing $225 million of common stock or approximately one quarter of the plan's $900 million repurchase authorization for the four quarters, starting July 1st, 2017. Those repurchases, net of retained earnings, combined with the reduction of risk weighted assets during the past quarter, brought M&T's common equity, tier-1 ratio under the current transitional Basel-III capital rules, to an estimated 10.98% compared with 10.81% at the end of the second quarter.","Turning to the outlook; as we enter the final quarter, our outlook for 2017 is a little changed. The net interest margin and net interest income have been stronger than expected, following two rate actions from the Fed so far this year. On the other hand, the loan growth we have seen has been pretty much as expected, which was low single digit growth on a year-over-year basis. For the first three quarters of 2017, average loans are up about 1% compared with the same period in 2016. On that same basis, but excluding the impact of the run-off in residential mortgages, average loans are up 7% over 2016.","As we head into the fourth quarter, there is a little more positive tone from our customers about their businesses, which is being reflected in our loan pipeline. The implied forward curve, shows a high probability of a rate action by the Fed late in the year. However, any hike would not have a significant impact on 2017's overall results.","Absent any unanticipated moves by the Fed, we expect some of the margin pressures we are seeing to be more apparent in the coming quarter. This includes the full quarter impact from the debt we issued in August and continued pressure on commercial loan margins.","The outlook for the fee businesses has little changed, with some continued softness in mortgage banking, being offset by good momentum in other fee categories.","Our expense outlook is also unchanged; excluding the specific litigation related costs in the third quarter, which we noted earlier, we continue to expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses in 2017 compared to last year. Despite this quarter's strong results, we continue to view credit, more as a downside risk than an upside opportunity. We expect to see a slight uptick in criticized loans when we filed our third quarter 10-Q, but to a level still below the end of last year.","As to capital, given our strong operating performance and our solid capital ratios, we will continue execution of our 2017 capital plan.","Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Darren, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about a couple of those NII components? You mentioned that there might be some more parent NIM pressures underneath. Can you just walk us through the combination of that, versus the size of the balance sheet, which continues to shrink as well? Are we looking at a pause in NII growth ex rates from here, or could that loan pipeline commentary still lead you to see some growth?","Darren King","Sure Ken and good morning. So let's take those two components that you talked about individually. On the net interest margin side, obviously we benefitted as the industry from the rate increases that have happened this year. As we look forward through the fourth quarter, without anything planned. It's our anticipation that we will see a slight downtick in the net interest margin, in the fourth quarter, driven mainly by the full quarter impact of the debt that we -- debt offering we did in August, and as we have been talking about before, there is still some slight core margin compression, as new commercial loans roll on at a slightly lower margin than what is rolling off.","Now, the good news there is that, we have actually seen stabilization in loan margins over the last several quarters, probably last three quarters. So we are not expecting anything down, it's just the natural churn that happens, as longer dated loans roll of and the newer ones come on. So a slight margin compression.","When we look forward at the loan balances, we are optimistic that we will see flat to slightly up on loan balances for the fourth quarter. When we think about where -- excluding the residential mortgage portfolio of course. And when we look at what the drivers are, we see the normal seasonal impact of other floor plan balances coming back on to the balance sheet. We started to see that at the end of September. And as we mentioned, the pipeline, that we are looking and as we enter the fourth quarter, is at the highest level that has been entering any quarter this year. So we are feeling much more positive about where loan growth might be in the fourth quarter. I don't think we are going to see anything like we saw in 2016, unfortunately. But it feels like we are in a better spot.","When you put the two together, for NII, for the fourth quarter, we are probably flat to maybe slightly down, but not anything too dramatic.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And I will keep my follow-up just to the other side then of loan growth, if you are expecting the ex-mortgage loan to be flat to slightly up, can you just give us updated thoughts on the pace of the resi book rundown, and how you are expecting that to go, as you look not just to the fourth, but on an ongoing basis, given where rates are?","Darren King","Sure. So you look at the pace of decline in the resi-mortgage book, it has been pretty consistent on a percentage basis, over the last five quarters. The dollar amount is decreasing as the portfolio shrinks, and we expect that to continue. A large portion of that is just normal amortization of that book, it has a number of 5-1 and 7-1 option arms in there, that would have a normal paydown cycle, obviously, as well as the third year product.","So when we look forward, we expect that that rate of decrease will be approximately the same, and as we get into 2018, we expect that the dollar amount will start to shrink, as the portfolio gets smaller. So we will talk more about 2018 in January, but just to give you a little sense of where we see that going over this quarter and the coming quarters.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thanks very much.","Darren King","The Hudson City 5-1, 7-1s are hybrid arms, but they are not options.","Ken Usdin","Thank you for the clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit about customer deposit behavior? I get the run-off in the Hudson City loans, but it feels like there might be a little less growth than expected on the deposit side, ex Hudson City piece. Where do you see and what kind of conversations are you having with customers? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure Ken. So the kind of conversations we are having with customers varies fairly dramatically, depending on which customer base we are talking to, and which balances we are looking at. If you look in our statements in the press release, you will see some increase in the rate in now balances, and in those balances are some mortgage escrow balances that are tied to the servicing business that we do. Those are all indexed to market. So obviously, as the market moves up and that's driving up those costs.","When we look at and deal with our larger commercial customers, they tend to be the most price sensitive and we are working with each of those customers on an individual basis, to work through deposit pricing. And the other place where we see a little bit more activity and sensitivity, is with the larger balanced consumer customers, which are typically affluent or private banking types of customers, where because again, the size of the balances are a little bit bigger, they are a little more sensitive to rate.","When we look through the rest of the portfolio, in general, on the consumer side and the rest of the smaller and the commercial, including small business; there still seems to be somewhat less of a focus on rate in those customers, and the other thing that we are kind of seeing, when we look at total balances is as rates still haven't gotten back to where they were at the bottom of the last cycle. Customers in the consumer and small business area are tending to stay short-dated. So when we look at the time book, it's very skewed towards six months and 12 months or under, and people are not really signing up for two year, three year, five year CDs, which is helping keep the yield down, and some people are staying liquid. So I think you are seeing some shift across categories right now, which is partly helping keep balances flat, and we will obviously be paying a lot of attention to rates and competitive pricing, as we go forward to protect those balances, and make sure we are doing the right thing for our customers.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, great. And just a clarification question, just back on the loan growth piece, the [indiscernible] that you have for growth improving in fourth quarter, was that more on the C&I side, or the CRE? Because I guess, my question is really more around what are you seeing in CRE, specifically? Because I know those balances have been pretty flat for the last few quarters? Thanks.","Darren King","Right. So it's really both, but more skewed towards the C&I side. When you look at our CRE balances, as you pointed out, through the year, they have been fairly flat. And what's going on underneath, is there is a little bit of shift happening from construction to more permanent types of financing, and what -- that's kind of expected. We had a big run up in construction balances during the latter part of 2016, as projects were nearing their completion. And now we are seeing this year, them reach the conclusion of their normal life, which is they get completed and they turn into a permanent mortgage or the condos get bought, which is a good thing, and that's being replaced by other lending around the footprint, could be owner-occupied, could be other permanent mortgages. But that churn is what's happening inside, and why you are seeing relatively flat. We expect that will continue and we have seen a little more optimism on the C&I side.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Darren King","Good morning Brian.","Brian Klock","So Darren, again just another follow-up on the loan growth question and on the C&I side of it, I know you mentioned that the average balances were driven a lot by the dealer floor plan seasonal decline. When I look at the end of period balances, you had about a $450 million quarter-to-quarter drop. I guess, is that -- was most of that related to the dealer floor plan? I guess, maybe on the end of period or spot balances, do you have that information related to the dealer floor plan impact?","Darren King","At the spot balance, it would be less than what the average was for the quarter, because we started to see some of those inventory starting to build and some of those loans starting to come back. So when we looked at the quarter, on average, the ratio was about two-thirds non-floor plan, one-third floor plan. I think, when you get to the end of the quarter, and you look at the end of the period versus the prior year, probably in the same approximate ratio between those two categories.","Brian Klock","So I guess, on the end of period and the rest of the weakness and that end of period, is that additional sort of paydowns that you -- I guess you guys, and a lot of your peers talked about, with some of the capital markets impact of refinancing or other -- because of where the interest rate environment was, that you saw some paydowns in that core C&I book?","Darren King","Yeah. Paydowns were probably the biggest driver of decreases in the quarter. When you look at originations, they were down a little bit, but not the biggest driver. The biggest driver was the rate of paydowns. And across the book, there is a whole host of reasons why those things are happening. Some of it is non-banks, which we mentioned earlier, that's real estate related. We have seen some of our customers sell parts of their business, because rates are -- asset prices are so strong, and if they do that, then they would tend to pay down their loan balances, and we have seen some of the debt capital markets business coming further down in middle market. So it's -- what's interesting is, when we look at prime, we are not seeing any one particular industry, any one particular geography. It's kind of more broad-based, and why we feel a little bit more optimistic as we head into the fourth quarter, is when we look at the pipeline, it too is fairly broad-based.","Brian Klock","Okay. And just one quick question and I will get back in the queue; commercial real estate, I know you talked about the declines, but were there anything that was a prepayment in commercial real estate that ended up with a prepayment penalty in the spread income? Thanks.","Darren King","Prepayment penalties in spread income this quarter were not materially different from what they have been for the past several quarters. There is no step-up.","Brian Klock","All right, great. Thanks Darren.","Operator","Your next question comes from Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning. Just first a follow-up to that question, I guess, just on the commercial real estate yields quarter-over-quarter, I was kind of surprised to see the 20 basis point increase. Just wondering if you could speak to -- that's a swapping out the fixed rate? Is that a decent run rate going forward, that $450 million?","Darren King","I think it's fairly decent run rate as we go forward, when we look at just the straight pricing on those deals and the spread over LIBOR, I think that's probably pretty reasonable to take forward.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. And then just on the other side of the balance sheet, just in terms of the Hudson City CDs, could you just remind us Darren, that process, how far long? I mean, how much is left and where that's pricing from and pricing to?","Darren King","Yes. So if you look at where we are in that book, we are about two-thirds of the way through has been repriced, at least once, and don't forget that a lot of what's repriced has been the shorter duration or shorter term product. We have got about a third of it left to reprice, so that was longer dated, three, four, five year CDs that are rolling off, and they should roll off approximately equal amounts over the next two to three years. And when we look at where pricing has been on those, it's a little bit tricky, because what we are seeing when people are repricing, is they are generally going into a lower term. So you are coming off of two and three, and then in some cases, five year term, that were carrying rates, in some cases, over 2%. And generally, no one is really signing up for any kind of CD greater than above 12 months. So we are repricing those down around 90 to 100 basis points, depending on the market, obviously, we have New Jersey, and you are seeing that benefit. But it's not as straightforward as just comparing the current two year CD to a rolling-off two year CD, because people are shifting term buckets as well.","Frank Schiraldi","Got you. Okay. And I guess, you'd seek to offer that with some longer -- to keep the duration of that book, sort of none at all with CD book, but just liabilities overall, you [indiscernible] something longer, so you know, the duration wouldn't change as much?","Darren King","Yeah. I guess, at this point in the book, the duration is coming down naturally as the mix is shifting. And I don't think that segment of the deposit balances are enough to materially shift the duration of the whole portfolio. So it's not something that we are as worried about and as focused on, as much as making sure that in those markets, our rates are competitive and that we are trying to retain those balances.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Good morning. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit, just the loan growth outlook for 2018? Do you think you can see maintain that low single digit growth, just given some of the continued pressure on the resi mortgage side?","Darren King","As far as our 2018 outlook, we are going through our work right now, and planning our 2018 operating numbers and looking at the pipeline and where we see 2018 shaping up. So probably a little premature for me to speculate on or forecast what 2018 might be, but we will be back in January with a full outlook for 2018.","Peter Winter","Then just a follow-up, is there a certain level that you would see resi-mortgage, that you would like to see it as a percent of total loans?","Darren King","We definitely will maintain a level of resi mortgage on the balance sheet, just from a -- we supporting the community, many of these are customers that have broader relationships with the bank, and those mortgages we tend to hold on our balance sheet as well, because it helps from a customer service perspective. When we look at the proportion, in terms of the total balance sheet, as I kind of tend to look at what the proportion was, we were running at before Hudson City. And if you look at the composition of the balance sheet for M&T before we merged with Hudson City, that over time, that's what we would expect the whole balance sheet to start to look like. It will have a similar percentage of CRE, C&I mortgage consumer balances is what we did pre-Hudson City, and that's the transition that we are executing right now of converting that thrift into a commercial bank. And you know, I think like we talked about earlier, the good news on that portfolio was, as it continues to decline, the headwind, if you will, of the dollars running off, will start to get smaller, as that portfolio gets smaller. And that should help with loan growth, on an absolute basis, on total balance sheet.","Peter Winter","Great. Thanks Darren.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. Can you talk about your ability and interest in doing bank deals with the AML consent order behind you now? And obviously, given your strong capital position as well?","Darren King","Sure. So our ability to engage in those kinds of dialogs and thoughts has improved, and we are certainly open to having those conversations. It takes both a willing buyer, which we are, and a willing seller, so not sure where the world stands from that perspective. But when we look at things that we would be open to discussing, certainly whole bank mergers would make sense, but we are also -- given the construct of the bank, and how it has changed over the last few years, our field of play is a little bit wider, and we continue to look at mortgage servicing, as a place where we can [indiscernible], and then obviously in the fee businesses, our wealth business, and our institutional custody businesses are places that we like the returns, and we like our position and we will be open to talking about those as well. So the spectrum is a little broader than it was before, and our interest and ability is kind of back to pretty much where it was before. But we have got to keep our eye on prices and our criteria hasn't changed from what it was before, and that is that we always look at what the return -- primarily, interior rate of return on those deals is, and is that at a rate that's higher than our long term cost of capital, and what impact would it have on our earnings per share and our book value per share, and how long could we pay it back. And all those numbers have to work, along with having a willing seller. So definitely, interested in conversations, but nothing -- really, nothing to report either.","Matt O'Connor","All right. And on the willingness of sellers, I mean, obviously, smaller bank stocks have lagged the bigger ones, kind of generally speaking, and I don't know if that plus kind of slow loan growth, flatter yield curve is making folks more open to partnering. Do you have any thoughts on that?","Darren King","I guess -- I think there is probably a number of things that tend to make people interested in considering a partnership. The loan growth is one of them. Expense management is another one that's out there too. When you look at banking and the cost of complying with regulation, and as you get closer to those key thresholds, either $10 billion or $50 billion, that has a material impact on our bank's cost infrastructure. Not to mention the pace of technology and the ability to spread those costs over a bigger revenue pool, makes people little bit more interested.","On the counter side, credit is as good as it has been, and earnings are pretty high, which means valuations tend to be high. So to the extent there is a seller that's looking at that, if they want to get paid upfront, that's a little tougher. If they want to be long term partners and investors along with us, those are the kind of things that we have tended to do, and both sides have tended to benefit quite nicely from those kinds of combinations.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. The CET1 ratios continue to build, I guess the weaker loan growth, contributing to a lower denominator. Have you got any more thoughts about putting in a mid-cycle submission and seeing if you can increase the capital return approval that you got in the CCAR earlier this year?","Darren King","Sure Geoff. So we are certainly pleased with the strength of the capital ratios, and as we pointed out numerous times over the last few quarters, that when we look at our consistency of earnings and credit quality and the little volatility that we think we should be running with those ratios much lower than where they are. And this year's results are not just the balance sheet decline per se, but when we talk about the mix of those commercial real estate loans and the shift, that has a big impact on risk weighted assets, which is helping that ratio. Not to mention, the fact that credit and earnings are so strong, it is helping build capital.","That said to your question, we have mentioned before, that there is a resubmission process that the Federal Reserve has, but anything that is done with the Fed is a non-public event. So we don't have anything to say on that front.","Geoffrey Elliott","Okay. Understood. And then you mentioned, you'd I guess ideally be at lower capital ratios. What do you think the right number is for CET1 to settle out over time?","Darren King","I think, it's obviously -- your target ratio is a function of the risk in the balance sheet and the mix of the assets that are on there. That said, when we look at where we stand versus the peer group, and given our history, we think we should be operating at the low end of the peer group. And that can be a bit of a moving target, that every bank I think has -- I know, has to have an internal target, and I suspect they are all running above that, and one of the things that's watched very closely is, your capital ratios relative to your peers. And for us, we think the write-in -- right spot for us, given our history of credit quality and stability of PPNR that we should run at the bottom end of the peer group.","Geoffrey Elliott","Got it. Thank you.","Darren King","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning Darren. I wanted to start, on the margin pressure, you indicated new loans coming on at a lower level than where loans are running off. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude, what's the size of that, and where do we think market interest rates need to be for that to stabilize?","Darren King","It's a great question, and we are really close. So if you recall, back a year ago, we would talk about core margin compression of kind of 2 to 3 basis points a quarter. And if we look at where, roll forward 12 months at the mix of what's rolling off or the pace of what's rolling off compared to what's rolling on and the stability we have had in spreads over that time period, it's really close. So we are probably about a difference of one to two basis points, and we don't need much difference, much of an uptick in the spread. It's really the spread, right, that matters; before that neutralizes and becomes less of an impact.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And just if -- another follow-up on the loan growth. A lot of banks are seeing stronger commercial pipelines, but not seeing this convert into stronger reported loan growth, and you are clearly more optimistic here. Give us more color, what are you looking at, that gives you this confidence, C&I is going to turn, particularly given how weak it was here in the third quarter? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So I guess there is a couple of things. Number one is just the approved pipeline. And when we look at the approved pipeline coming into the fourth quarter compared to what we saw going into the second and third, it's higher by probably round numbers 15%, 20%, and that's a very good leading indicator. It has been our history that those tend to show up on the balance sheet, with a two to 2.5 month lag, and because that's up, we are feeling more confident that we will start to see it convert on to the balance sheet. But the wildcard is, is obviously the paydown activity. And when we look year-over-year, we saw a fairly active paydown from our customers in the second quarter. But as the quarter came to a close, that seemed to be moderating somewhat. So when we put the two together, we feel a little more optimistic. We feel certainly better from the origination side and believe that the paydowns and payoffs will start to temper a little bit and the combination will lead to a little bit of asset growth, ex the Hudson City runoff portfolio in the fourth quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thank you. And if I could squeeze one technical question; what was the balance of floor plan loans at the end of the quarter? I know you gave us a change, but what was the actual balance?","Darren King","It's not something that we have historically disclosed.","Steven Alexopoulos","Well now is your chance, if you'd like to do it.","Darren King","I am okay.","Steven Alexopoulos","No? Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I had two minor [ph] questions, but if you look at the net charge-off improvement this particular quarter, I was trying to distinguish between how much of that was just gross charge-offs going down, or maybe the realization of a recovery or two in the quarter?","Darren King","Sure. It's generally Marty, just lower charge-offs in general, not offset by recoveries this quarter. As we talked about pay-offs and paydowns, one of the nice things about this is, that they don't just affect the business that is performing, sometimes they affect your criticized assets as well. And so we had a very strong charge-off quarter, but it was not the result of outsized recoveries this quarter. Those recoveries are pretty consistent with what we have been seeing all year.","Marty Mosby","And then the other fee income line dropped to the low end of the range, it was about $10 million off of where it was last quarter. We are just curious if there was anything unusual about that particular -- those line items this quarter?","Darren King","The big drivers there Marty were really loan related fees, syndication fees and other advisory fees as well as some of the kind of letter of credit fees. And as the -- we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the loan book, we saw a slowdown in the fee activity, they tend to go together. Not to mention, in the second quarter, we had a really outsized performance in the syndication books. So quarter-over-quarter, they looked a little bit -- it's short of a big decline. Probably, if you are thinking about going forward, if you take third and second quarter and average them, you are probably in a better spot.","Marty Mosby","Good. And materialization of that approved pipeline probably helps out as well?","Darren King","We are counting on it, yeah.","Marty Mosby","Right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Darren King","Hi John.","John Pancari","On the -- back on the charge-off topic there, if it was not influenced by recoveries and a just more general improvement, what is a fair run rate here for next quarter, and potentially into 2018? Are we looking at staying in that 10 to 15 basis point range for the ratio, or is it back to the 20 basis point ballpark?","Darren King","So we will talk about 2018 in January. But if you look at the average of the last, probably eight quarters, if not 12, we have been pretty consistently between 18 and 20 basis points of charge-offs. We had one quarter, where I think we went to 22. I think we did have one other quarter, where we did have a bunch of recoveries, where it was 11. But generally, even in that range, and I think that's probably a safe range to be thinking about, at least for the next quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, separately back to the M&A topic, so what is your sweet spot that you are looking at, in terms of target assets, if it was going to be a whole bank deal? And then, what regions of the U.S. would you prioritize? And then I know, you were asked about some of the metrics, and should we say, the earn-back? What is something that you would view as a digestable earn-back period that you would consider when doing a deal? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So I guess, in general, if you look at our history through time with M&A, we have been pretty opportunistic. And when you look at our field of play, it's pretty much anywhere where we do business today and states that are contiguous to that. We have tended to always be in footprint or somewhat overlapping in a contiguous footprint. It has not been our history to add a bank, let's say in the Midwest, where it's not connected to our footprint. Generally, we like things that are close by, for two main reasons; one is, it tends to be -- give us a chance to leverage our brand. But more importantly, it allows us to leverage our people. And one of the most important ingredients we believe to our success, is the leadership in the folks of the bank which bring that culture, particularly our credit culture and our expense culture to that new institution, and therefore proximity helps us leverage our management resources into those acquired operations.","When you look across the footprint, we are interested in pretty much any geography. And really the challenge on size is in any acquisition that needs to be big enough to have an impact on your financials, such that it's worth the investment that you make to complete an acquisition, and on the upper bound, it can't be so big that you can't manage the risk of combining the two organizations. Not to give hard numbers, but our history has been that generally, we'd like things that are 20% to a third or 40% of our size, but we have done smaller, and where it makes sense in footprint, where it's a strong combination, and where the returns make sense, we are definitely open to it and we have done those.","So it's a little bit big, but that's kind of generally how we look at things, and we will pretty much talk to anybody, if they have got a compelling story to think. And our return measures, I mentioned earlier, I will reiterate them. We are looking for combinations, where the value created is -- results in a return that's greater than our long term cost to capital. So number one thing is being earning a return for our shareholders, and part of the other metrics that we look at, that help us feel comfortable with that are the dilution or a lack thereof, hopefully, to earnings per share and tangible book value per share. And then we look at the payback period, and obviously, the faster the better, because you are more certain with the cash flows that you project one year out compared to the ones that you project five years out.","So there is not one metric necessarily that we hold more dear than the others. But if you make that combination of metrics work, you tend to have good success.","John Pancari","Got it. Thank you, Darren.","Operator","Your final question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes, thank you. Just two quick follow-up questions. Appreciate all the color on the loan yield and deposit pricing outlook; I am wondering, with the market pricing in over 80% probability of a December rate hike, how should we think about NIM expansions for the first quarter of 2018? Sort of putting all those dynamics together?","Darren King","So I guess, if you think about the first quarter of 2018 and you think about the NIM expansion. We have mentioned through the last number of quarters, that 25 basis points tends to be worth about six to 10 basis points on the NIM, and obviously that range is affected by deposit betas and pricing changes. And when we look forward, we think that that still holds for the next 25, which we will get beyond, I am not sure. But that should give you a good range, under which to think, at least through the end of the year.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And in your prepared remarks, you reiterated the low -- no change in the expense outlook, which is low expense growth year-over-year in 2017. Should we take out the $50 million legal reserve build, when we think about that trajectory?","Darren King","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi Darren.","Darren King","Hey Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize I got disconnected, so I don't know if you were asked this question; but can you give us some color? I think I heard you say in your prepared remarks, that criticized loans, when you file in your Q will be up this quarter. If so, by about how much, and can you give us any color behind what's driving that?","Darren King","I did mention that, and it was mostly just making sure that there were no surprises for you all, when you look through the numbers. They are up a little bit versus second quarter, but when you look compared to where we ended 2016, they are actually going to be below that. So certainly don't read this as the sky is falling, we are not trying to be chicken little here, more just transparent.","When we look through the criticized book and some of the changes and much like our loan trends, there is nothing specific that we are seeing. There is nothing that we are seeing in terms of any industry concentration, any geographic concentration. It's just -- if there is anything that kind of tends to pop up and this is a small piece. So again, let's not overreact, is balance sheets, where companies tend to be highly leveraged. And when you end up in some of those highly leveraged transactions, those present a little bit more risk. But it's not enough for us to ring the alarm bell. But if there is anything that kind of jumps out, it's that kind of thing. But overall, the change in criticized is fairly broad based.","Gerard Cassidy","Good. Thank you for the clarity. And then as a follow-up, Bob talked about it in your shareholder letter this year, about the elevated costs due to regulatory compliance that M&T had to handle. Now you announced of course the Wilmington settlement. On a go forward basis, operating expenses, should we see the rising 1% to 2% a year, or can you give us some flavor for -- now that these big issues are behind you guys, we just maybe see lower expense growth on a go forward basis?","Darren King","I mentioned before, we are doing our work on the 2018 operating plan, and we will be back in January with some better outlook for you. But in general, when we look at the cost of compliance and the like, in our income statement. The increase that we experience going through the written agreement, is largely baked into our run rate now. And there shouldn't be any large increases as a result of that. We are hopeful that as we continue to hone our operations and get more effective at it, that we can manage the growth in those. But when you look at our expense base, and you got a half to slightly more as people expenses, and with what's going on in labor markets and salary increases, that there is just going to be some upward pressure on that. We think that's manageable. But it's probably going to be difficult to see that go down.","Gerard Cassidy","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Don MacLeod","Thank you Samantha and good morning. I would like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.","Also before we start, I would like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.","Darren King","Thank you Don and good morning everyone. As noted in this morning's earnings press release, M&T's results for the third quarter include several items that we think are worth highlighting.","Total revenues grew from the prior quarter and the year ago quarter notwithstanding the lower interest rate environment and associated pressures on net interest income. Although we recognized an additional valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights, which reflects higher expected prepayments arising from lower interest rates, we also record an impressive increase in mortgage banking revenues. This demonstrates how mortgage loan originations can act as somewhat of a partial hedge for the mortgage servicing business.","Loan growth continues to be steady and in line with our expectations for low single digit aggregate growth in 2019. Credit quality is consistent with our recent experience with net charge-offs stable at rates well below our long term average. A further decline in criticize loans was accompanied by an increase in non-accrual loans primarily as a result of one large loan previously reported as criticized.","Let's take a look at the specifics. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.47 for the third quarter of 2019, compared with $3.34 in the second quarter of 2019 and $3.53 in the third quarter of 2018. Net income for the quarter was $480 million compared with $473 million in the linked quarter and $526 million in the year ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.58% and an annualized return on average common equity of 12.73%. This compares with rates of 1.6% and 12.68%, respectively, in the previous quarter.","Included in the GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $4 million or $0.03 per common share, little change from the prior quarter. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.","M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $484 million compared with $477 million in the linked quarter and $531 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.50 for the recent quarter compared with $3.37 in 2019's second quarter and $3.56 in the third quarter of 2018. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1.66% and 18.85% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.68% and 18.83% in the second quarter of 2019.","In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.","Recall that both GAAP and net operating earnings for the second quarter of 2019 were impacted by a $48 million write-down of M&T's investment in an asset manager, which have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The write-down amounted to $36 million after-tax effect or $0.27 per common share. In July 2019, M&T agreed to sell its investment in the asset manager which had been obtained in the 2011 acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation. The sale was consummated in late September. There were no such noteworthy items in 2018's third quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2019, down by $12 million or 1% from the linked quarter. This reflects a narrower net interest margin, partially offset by growth in both loans and total earning assets. The margin for the quarter was 3.78%, down 13 basis points from 3.91% in the linked quarter. Contributing to that decline were several offsetting items.","On the positive side, a more favorable mix of interest earning asset assets, specifically a higher proportion of loans added about two basis points to the margin. A higher level of cash on deposit at the Fed accounted for an estimated two basis points of the decline in the margin. We estimate that lower short term market rates, primarily LIBOR, accounted for some eight basis points of the decline. This is consistent with our expectations of a four to nine basis point decline in the margin over the ensuing 12 months period following a hypothetical 25 basis point cut in the Fed funds target and by application LIBOR.","A higher cost of interest-bearing deposits, primarily mortgage escrow deposits, accounted for approximately five basis points of the decline. We continue to see some inflows of these escrow deposits, a result of higher prepayment of mortgage loans we service or sub-service on behalf of mortgage-backed security investors. Absent the higher level of escrow deposits, the total cost of interest-bearing deposits would have been approximately flat as we manage deposit rates lower.","As expected, the migration of deposits into higher-yielding categories, notably commercial deposits into interest checking and on balance sheet suite, has slowed and rates offered on new certificates of deposit have declined. Average loans grew by 1% compared with the previous quarter. Originations remain solid, while payoffs and paydowns remain consistent with levels we have experienced in the first half of 2019.","Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter. Commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat compared with the linked quarter as the usual seasonal softness in loans to auto dealers to finance inventories was offsetting growth in other categories. Commercial real estate loans grew 1% compared with the second quarter. Residential real estate loans declined by less than 1.5% compared with the linked quarter as was the case last quarter, a continued comparatively steady pace of paydowns of mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City transaction was partially offset by higher levels of loans originated for sale. Holding originations for sale aside, we expect the portfolio of acquired mortgage loans to continue its low double digit rate of principal amortization in future quarters. Consumer loans were up 4% as growth in recreation finance loans continues to outpace declines in home equity lines and loans. There were no particular standouts, positively or negatively, in our community banking regions from a loan growth perspective.","From the line of business view, recreational vehicle financing as well as residential and commercial mortgage banking were particularly strong. Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Island office and CDs over $250,000 grew an estimated 3% compared with the second quarter. This primarily reflects the escrow deposits we referenced earlier.","Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $528 million in the third quarter, compared with $512 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $137 million in the recent quarter, compared with $107 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $835 million in the quarter, up from $723 million in the second quarter, reflecting a new wave of refinancing activity in the face of the lower longer term interest rate environment as well as seasonal strength.","Total mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were $88 million in the third quarter, improved from $72 million in the prior quarter.","Don MacLeod","Clarify, that's residential mortgage banking revenues.","Darren King","Thank you Don. In addition, the higher gain on sale revenues, the increase reflects reaching the run rate of the residential loan servicing and sub-servicing that we acquired in the first and second quarters. Commercial banking revenues were $49 million in the third quarter, compared with $35 million in the linked quarter, reflecting notably stronger origination activity. The $30 million or 28% increase in total mortgage banking revenues brings with it higher expenses, notably $5 million of compensation costs as well as the $14 million valuation allowance recorded during the quarter on our mortgage servicing rights.","Trust income was $144 million in the recent quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter. Recall that the second quarter results include $4 million of seasonal fees earned assisting clients with their tax filings, which did not recur in the third quarter. Trust income continues to go in the upper single digit range over the prior year.","Service charges on deposit accounts were $111 million, up from $108 million in the second quarter. The recent quarter included $4 million of securities gains, representing valuation gains on equity securities while the second quarter of 2019 included $9 million of similar valuation gains.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $873 million compared with $868 million in the prior quarter. As previously noted, the prior quarter's results include a $48 million write-down of our investment in an asset manager acquired in the Wilmington Trust merger. The two most recent quarter's results reflect an addition to a valuation allowance on our mortgage servicing rights as a result of lower long term interest rates. Those additions amounted to $14 million and $9 million in the third and second quarters, respectively. As noted earlier, those same lower rates have prompted a notable uptick in residential mortgage loan originations and associated gain on sale revenues.","Salaries and benefits were $477 million, up $21 million from $456 million in the prior quarter. Contributing to the increase was one extra compensation date in the third quarter amounting to $5 million as well as $5 million of compensation costs arising from the uptick in residential and commercial mortgage loan originations that I just referenced. In addition, the third quarter results include another $10 million of costs that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter.","The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter, relatively unchanged from 2019's second quarter. The ratios for both quarters include the additions to the MSR valuation allowance while the second quarter figure includes the write-down of the investment in the asset manager.","Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remains consistent with our recent experience given the continued strength of the economy. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 16 basis points for the third quarter, little changed from the 15 basis points in the first half of 2019. Non-accrual loans increased by $140 million at September 30 compared with the end of June, reflecting one large commercial loan to a wholesale distributor that was previously included in criticized loans. The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans rose to 1.12% at the end of the quarter. Notwithstanding the increase in non-accrual loans, total criticized loans decreased further from the levels seen at the end of June. The provision for credit losses was $45 million in the recent quarter exceeding net charge-offs by $9 million. The excess provision primarily relates to the non-accrual loan to the wholesale distributor, net of the decline in other criticized loans. The allowance for credit losses increased to $1.04 billion at the end of September, compared with $1.03 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The ratio of the allowance to total loans increased by one basis point to 1.16%. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $461 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $434 million or 94% were guaranteed by government related entities.","Turning to capital. M&T's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9.81% at September 30 compared with 9.84% at the end of the second quarter. The modest three basis point decline reflects the net impact of higher loans, earnings retention and capital distributions. During the quarter, M&T repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $300 million.","Now turning to the outlook. As we enter the final quarter of 2019, our guidance for the year remains little changed from our prior comments. We continue to expect growth in total loans in 2019 to be at the low single digit pace with continued runoff in residential mortgages more than offset by aggregate growth in the other loan categories. The reductions in short term rates implied by the forward curve will continue to pressure both net interest income and the net interest margin. However, we still expect modest year-over-year growth in net interest income for 2019.","All else being equal and holding aside volatility in escrow deposit balances and associated cash balances placed at the Fed, each hypothetical reduction of 25 basis points in the Fed funds target should result in four to nine basis points of margin pressure over the ensuing 12 months. The servicing and sub-servicing acquisitions we completed combined with the strong third quarter origination activity in both our residential and commercial mortgage banking operations has resulted in mortgage banking revenues growing better than expected while trust income has been in line with our expectations growing at a little better than a mid single digit pace. We would not expect mortgage banking results for the fourth quarter, either residential or commercial, to match those seen in the third quarter. The remaining fee businesses continued to perform in line with our expectations growing in the low single digit range.","Expenses for the year have grown a little more rapidly than we previously indicated driven by two primary factors, growth in the mortgage business and investments in the bank, notably IT staff. Higher expenses associated with the servicing and sub-servicing acquisitions as well as from a compensation expense associated with strong mortgage originations activity drove expenses above our initial expectations. We also continue to expect to see some offsets to the year-to-date additions to IT staff through lower contractor and consulting expenses starting in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter expenses to be lower than the recent quarter.","Our outlook for credit remains little changed. While sentiment about a potential recession is building, we are not seeing or hearing signs of a slowdown. Our customers' largest concern is their ability to find enough workers with the right skills to add to capacity. As noted, criticized loans will be down this quarter from the end of June. That said, the specific reserve taken on the wholesale distributor we mentioned could result in a notable charge-off in the coming quarters.","Regarding the new loan loss accounting standard, known as CECL, we have completed our second parallel run and expect to disclose preliminary results in the third quarter 10-Q. To preview those results and based on the current economic forecasts, we would expect the allowance for losses on loans and leases to increase by approximately 5% to 15% upon adoption of the accounting standard. That in turn should result in an impact to our capital ratios of less than 10 basis points.","Regarding capital, we expect to continue to execute the capital plan that we have previously outlined. Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.","Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Samantha will briefly review the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning John.","John Pancari","On the expense outlook, I just wanted to get an idea. I know you had indicated that the fourth quarter expenses should be down from the third quarter level. Just trying to understand, how we should think about the magnitude of that decline? I know your previous expectation had been that the second half expenses would be similar to the first half. So that would imply, if that still holds, that would imply a pretty sharp drop off in the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to get an idea what type of decline we can expect? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. So as we look at the fourth quarter and think about some of the things that happened in the third quarter, I will start with that. The mortgage business, obviously, had a great quarter and there was about $20 million of expenses associated with that which we didn't account for, to be honest, because we weren't sure where rates were going to be when we gave the guide. And so that $20 million, I would just kind of add it to the guide, but let's not forget that there was $30 million of revenue that came along with that. And then there was about $10 million of expenses that we recognized in the third quarter that I don't foresee recurring in the fourth. And so you at that point, we were a little bit above what the guide was but we wouldn't expect things to be necessarily equal in terms of each quarter in the second half being exactly the same. So we think that there is some room for the expenses to come down and get down to the level that would have been implied on an average basis in the guide that we gave before.","John Pancari","Okay. And then on that same topic, you mentioned that obviously the higher mortgage related costs were a factor but also the higher cost than you had expected in your technology investments. Can you give us a little more color there? What surprised you there? And how much should we think about that when we look at 2020? And if it could be a factor again as you forecast expenses going out? Thanks.","Darren King","Sure. I guess in the IT space, there is a few things, some which I would describe as timing-related in the quarter. When you see in the other software are other or processing and software line were some annual licensing expenses that came in the quarter. We wouldn't expect those to repeat. When you look in the other cost, that's where a lot of the professional services expenses. And in there, we talked about before, the pace at which the contractors roll-off as the new staff comes on. And there were some projects that extended maybe 30 days or 45 days, a little bit longer than we thought to bring them to completion. We have seen those roll-off as we get to the end of the quarter. And that's why we feel confident that we will actually start to see that the impact of the add to staff and the reduction in contractors as we go into the fourth quarter and start to recognize that into 2020.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Darren King","Good morning Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Actually, I just had a quick question in terms of the mortgage banking business. Obviously with the servicing that you have taken on, obviously this quarter was a really good result. But if we think about the ongoing run rate from this, I know you said fourth quarter is probably not going to as high as 3Q. But what is kind of the right level, if you can pick a number. I am just trying to get a sense, are we at some meaningfully sustainably higher level, given the servicing assets? Thank.","Darren King","Sure. So we are definitely at a higher level than where we would have been if you compared to the third quarter of last year. So the third quarter of this year would reflect pretty much a full quarter's run rate of both the servicing rights that we acquired as well as the sub-servicing. And that should be fairly stable. Of course, servicing is a declining asset and so the fees come down a little bit each quarter based on the unpaid balances. And then really the volatility that we wouldn't expect to repeat, but it also a bit of a function of rates, is just the origination activity.","And right now I am talking specifically on the residential side. Now, one of the things that does tend to happen when you buy servicing rights is, as you take the impairment or set up the allowance for prepayments, when those things prepay, oftentimes it shows up down the road in gain on sale. And that was part of the uptick in this last quarter.","In the commercial space, we had just a fantastic third quarter. I think it was the highest origination quarter in our history in commercial mortgage, driven off the originations. I think we saw a lot of activity in the marketplace where rates have come down and where there was some concern about the amount of business that Fannie and Freddie might do. Towards the end of the quarter, they reaffirmed their appetite for the coming five quarters.","It will probably take a little bit for the pipeline to rebuild but it should be a solid quarter, but what I would consider a more normal rate of gain on sale in the commercial mortgage space versus what we saw in the third quarter. And those are really what was part of our comments about some of the things that were a little bit outsized in the mortgage business in the third quarter of this year was really about originations as opposed to servicing. And servicing should be pretty consistent as we go from here.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Great. And could you just remind us like what is the dollar amount roughly that the acquired servicing and sub-servicing rights contributed to this quarter's earnings?","Darren King","When we talked about it in March, we talked about an additional $60 million of servicing revenue for the year with it building and peaking in this quarter. So we are probably in the range of $17 million to $20 million, somewhere in there, maybe closer $17 million than to $20 million.","In terms of what the run rate is on that acquired servicing, I guess I will just reiterate that you earn a fee based on the unpaid principal balance and each month those decline as people make their payments. So as those decline that fee income will move down at a similar place.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Hi guys. I just wanted to follow up on expense a little bit. It's been a pretty busy day just as I kind of try to add in the comments that you made about expenses in the fourth quarter, backing out the $30 million and kind of coming to the maybe average of what you were thinking before. What does that imply for 4Q dollar expenses, if you do that math?","Darren King","I guess if you do the math and you look at what we would have implied in the guide, it would have been right around $830 million, $835 million a quarter and you are probably in that range for the fourth quarter.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then a follow-up. It was asked earlier, but as you think about the underlying expense growth at the company, obviously mortgage was unusually high and you talked to some lumpiness in the investment. But as you think about kind of whether it's full year 2020 or a medium term underlying expense growth, where is that? And where I am getting to kind of the next question is, I think there is some concern that banks your size may not have some of the scale that you need and that's why we are seeing some expense pressure versus the big guys not so much. And obviously with the rate headwinds out there pressuring revenues on that side, it's just more magnified potentially. So if you could just address those two topics. Thank you.","Darren King","Yes. I guess I will try to remember them all. You said a lot there, Matt. I guess, overall, when you look at the expenses at the bank, this year was a year of expense growth that was very atypical for M&T. Obviously a bunch of it was related to the mortgage business and the servicing that we acquired. That was $40 million. We have so far added about $22 million to the valuation allowance, which we might not have anticipated when we first agreed to acquire those loans back almost a year ago. And so those have driven the expenses up.","And then the other thing that's been happening, obviously, is the investments we are making to change the way we deliver IT at the bank. And I think IT is probably one of the big things that is talked about in terms of scale. And what we are doing is, I think we are positioning ourselves to actually better compete with our competitors, both regional and large national players, by the investments that we are making. And so by shifting more of the resources, more of the IT team on staff, we think we can increase capacity in terms of what we are able to deliver for the same expense base. And that's part of why we are making that move and also the move to more agile approaches, which should bring new capabilities to market a little more quickly than what we may have done in the past.","And so part of the shift is to make sure that we are competitive and in the time that you are building that capability, you have got other projects going on. And we have talked a little bit before about the kind of double expense that you incur while you are making that transition. It will happen a little bit each quarter as we go through that. But we will start to see some of the payoff of that in the coming quarters and we think we will start to see it in the fourth quarter with the professional services cost going down.","And so when you think about where expenses are and have been for M&T over time, we will give you our thoughts on 2020 when we get to January. But really, when you look at M&T through time, we have been a low nominal expense growth player, generally kind of 2% a year or less. And we certainly think that we are in an industry where that's warranted and we think about that all the time. And given the growth this year and investments that we have made, we will look to see if we can't be in or below that range, as we go into 2020.","But like I said, we will give you more details on that in the January call. But I don't think we need to run at this kind of expense rate on an ongoing basis. And we absolutely have some ways to improve productivity based on the investments that we have made, which will help us stay competitive. And obviously we will react to the changing rate environment which we have done successfully in the past.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi with Sandler O'Neill.","Frank Schiraldi","Good morning. Just wondering if you could, Darren, if you can give a little more color on the credit that moved into non-accrual in the quarter in terms of industry, geography, collateral? Any color you could give would be interesting. Thanks.","Darren King","Yes. Sure. Obviously, we are not going to talk about specific customers per se, but when we look at this one customer, they are a wholesaler and so some of the financing is tied to inventory and receivables. And they have had some challenges internally with their management. And that's put them in a bit of a cash bind. And that's why we have kind of moved it from criticized into non-accrual. And the question will be, the ultimate value of the receivables and collectability of those as well as the inventory. We obviously don't think it's zero. But we do expect that there will be likely some loss on that as we work our way through.","Obviously given the magnitude of this relationship and the industry it was in, we went through all of our relationships over $100 million, which fortunately, I can count them on both hands and looked through them and they are not in similar industries and are in fact quite healthy. And we have looked through for other wholesaler and distributor type relationships and we didn't find any others that had this similar situation.","So when I look through the loans that went into criticized through the first and second quarter, this was one of them. When we talked about it at the time, we looked for any common themes in those criticized loans, either in terms of industry, geography or the like. And we couldn't find anything, other than they tended to be situational specific and oftentimes related to management. And I would describe this in that same ilk.","Frank Schiraldi","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you clearly mentioned you are not seeing broader weakness in credit. Just wondering if there is any areas that you are seeing as becoming more frothy areas you guys are shying away from in your various geographies?","Darren King","Nothing in particular. Obviously, we have paid a lot of attention all the way along to some of the office space. A lot of things going on recently in the industry. But we don't have much there. When we look around, there is nothing in particular that I would point to that is what I would describe as very frothy. There continues to be lots of competition for lending. Pricing seems to be fairly reasonable.","When I look at our spreads, they have been fairly consistent for the last three quarters. They did drop after tax reform. You kind of saw a resetting of the industry. After you saw a resetting of margin after tax reform, but that's stabilized since then. And overall, things seem really good. Structures haven't really changed much from what we have been dealing with over the last few quarters. And as we look, obviously, New York City is a place we pay a lot of attention to and we don't see anything there that causes us concern.","So nothing is really standing out right now, which always makes you wonder, what's going to pop. So we are continuously looking through the portfolio to see where there might be signs of weakness. But at this point, there is no one geography, industry or loan type, be it C&I, permanent, mortgages, construction where we have any concerns.","Frank Schiraldi","Yes. All right. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Hi Darren. Can we talk a little bit more about the net interest income? I heard your comments about the year-over-year growth expected still for 2019. But to the points about the cuts that have already happened and your guidance about what a cut does, the four to nine, on a full year basis, can you help us understand the pushes and pulls with just the remaining burden from the cuts and then the excess liquidity in terms of how you expect the NIM to traject from here in terms of magnitude of compression as you look to the fourth?","Darren King","Right. Now it's bit of a moving target these days, isn't it, Ken, with the pace of LIBOR and where the Fed might go. And that's really why we try to help give you guys the guide by talking about the four to nine basis points. That way you guys can figure out what you think the rate curve might look like.","But I guess a couple of things that I think are important when we talk about the margin and the net interest income. When you look over the last two quarters at the margin compression, the print doesn't seem great obviously. But when you look at net interest income, it was down $9 million last quarter and down $12 million this quarter. And when you look at some of the things going on underneath, that might take you beyond four to nine, you look at the increases in cash balances and the cash balances carry a positive spread, albeit small. So they don't harm net interest income, but they certainly harm the margin. And you would see the same thing with the escrow balances that have grown last quarter and this quarter as well, that they are basically slightly positive, in some cases, slightly negative carry. And so they don't have much of an impact on net interest income, but they do on the margin.","And so as we look forward, the four to nine per 25 seems fairly reasonable to us. The actual margin will move around a little bit, depending on what happens with escrow balances, which can be as much a function of the rate environment and prepayments as well as other cash balances at the Fed. So there is a bunch of pieces that are moving there, but at its core, it's four to nine.","The one thing that I think is encouraging is, we have started to see deposit costs bend over. If not for the escrow balance growth this quarter, we would have seen the increase in interest bearing deposit costs be basically zero. And we would start to see some traction on repricing activities as we go into the coming quarters which will help moderate the impact of any further decreases in LIBOR. But it still keeps you within that four to nine range as we go forward.","Ken Usdin","Yes. So just that I guess then my follow-up would just be then to your point about the modest downward trajectory of NII dollars. Is that the trajectory that you would still expect given and I hear you on all the moving parts of it, but, we still just have to expect that modest slide in NII as you go forward from here? Or is there something that can change with regards to that trajectory?","Darren King","The trajectory, it might move around a little bit in any given quarter depending on the pace of deposit repricing. But those are over a 12 month averages, is kind of the four to nine. And then obviously the biggest driver is just LIBOR and how fast LIBOR moves down and how many rate cuts we get. Most of the two we had this quarter are in there and there's probably a little bit of residual from the last cut, just because of when it happened in the quarter. So we will see some of that in the fourth quarter. And then we will see what happens with LIBOR and the Fed over the coming meetings.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Last quick one. Just you had mentioned, how much higher are the escrow deposits priced versus I guess the average interest bearing deposits at 85, to your point that, the 85 would have been closer to flat without the escrow. So can you just give us some understanding of the difference between where the escrow deposits are coming on versus where your kind of average is underneath?","Darren King","Yes. Sure. So round numbers, when you look at the escrow balances, they are priced off an index either off of Fed funds or off of LIBOR. So they are kind of around 180 these days. And when you look through the rest of the portfolio, it's primarily commercial interest checking that is driving the interest expense on that line. And within there, there is a range of rates. Those are individually negotiated with each customer based on the relationship and the magnitude of it. And my recollection is that the average there is around 70, 75 basis points. So probably double in terms of what the escrow balances are earning versus what the other ones are. The nice thing about the escrow balances is, is because they are linked to the index, as the index moves so too does the cost of those.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thank you Darren.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Steven, your line is open. Steven, you might have yourself on mute. Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Well, thank you. I wanted to touch base with you just to summarize these moving pieces, because when you think about your expenses, you really have one, the mortgage valuation, if I am getting you right and other expenses. Typically, that kind of gets netted out in revenues so you wouldn't see that grossed up expense. So that's driving your expenses higher this particular year. You have got this transition going from external technology support to internal technology support so right in the middle of that doubling up of expenses. You are seeing the benefit of those two things rolling off, as you kind of guided towards a $40 million to $50 million reduction in expenses as you go from the third to fourth quarter. As you go into next year, if you kind of take that dynamic forward, it seems like your expenses could actually drop as you go into 2020, once you get the benefits of not having the external tech spend and you don't have, let's say, the long-term rates are flat. So you don't have this valuation situation.","Darren King","So I guess if you look forward, Marty, I think the way you are thinking about it, is exactly the way we are seeing it and thinking about it. And really, the only thing that would be a timing difference on when we might see the expenses actually drop versus the growth rate drop very dramatically. The latter, we are definitely expecting, to see actual decrease.","We still got the transitions going on with that tech team. That's going to continue through 2021. And so we are looking to bring on a large number of folks and they have come on in chunks of probably 100 to 150. And that kind of happens consistently over maybe a quarter to every four months. And when you are in that time period, you are bearing the double costs. And so we have started down that path.","We did our first wave this year. It probably took us a little bit longer to get up to speed and a little bit longer to get some of the contractors out than we might have anticipated going on or going into it. But we are getting smarter on how we do that and better able to match the timing. So we shouldn't carry quite as long as we did this year. But we will continue to see that the cost of that transition happen through 2020 and really start to see the benefit in 2021.","On the mortgage side, like you pointed out, that stuff should wash itself out and as we go through 2020 compared to 2019 in the mortgage portfolio, holding the valuation reserves to the side, that should start to normalize itself and the expenses will obviously move in relation to how the unpaid balances are performing.","And then when we watch some of the other costs and some of the other professional services, there were some other activities that we had going on this year that we wouldn't expect to repeat. And so those should help expenses. The offset there is just compensation costs for folks that have been added to the team. And when you just give people raises, that raises your run rate and you have got to offset that. So there's a couple of things going on back and forth. But when you think high level over the next couple of years, the way you are thinking about it, Marty, is exactly the way we are thinking about it.","Marty Mosby","And then on the credit side, because really the variances in this particular quarter, in my mind, are expenses and then up in the credit side. The $9 million you have put into the allowance and you have put some into it last quarter as well, is that covered what you expect to see in the charge-off from this large relationship that might get charged off in the next couple of quarters? So have you kind of free funded that? And so when we see the event, you will actually just be drawing down reserves to pay off the expected loss?","Darren King","So what happened there, Marty, was that loan was obviously criticized before and we started to reserve for it at that point. There were some other criticized loans that either paid off or became performing. And so what we had put aside for them will help cover the increase in the one that went non-accrual and then we added to it. And so based on what we know today, it's in the provision and we feel good about it. But this one is a little bit more of a fluid relationship just because of the nature of the collateral.","And so depending on how things move with that organization, the collateral values could move around a little bit on us. And that's why we moved it to non-accrual and why we set up or added to the provision or added to the reserve and let you guys know that we will probably have something in the future. But the exact magnitude and timing is still a little bit unclear.","But outside of that, as you point out, criticized coming back down in the rest of the portfolios and we look at the delinquencies and what has been happening with the charge-offs, knock on wood, everything has been fairly stable and predictable and all else equal, one would expect that as rates come down, that would help debt service coverage ratios and customers' ability to pay, which wouldn't lead you to believe that the charge-offs might tick-up. The counter argument obviously is, if GDP slows and growth slows that, well, the interest costs might come down, you got to keep an eye on revenues and the ability to service the debt from that side of the equation.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo.","Chris Spahr","Thank you. I have a balance sheet question and a tech follow-up question. So for the balance sheet, the long term debt has been trending down for the past three to four years. Is that going to stabilize? Or do you think that can continue to run off as your liquidity gets kind of smoothed out unless you have another deal?","Darren King","Okay. So if you look at the long term debt, it's been coming down. But there has been a bit of an uptick in short term and then obviously, an uptick in some of the deposit balances in the last little while, particularly driven by escrow. And so the mix of long term and short term, we will now start to reevaluate, given that LCR, the ruling has been finalized. So we were kind of using more short term borrowing to manage the liquidity coverage ratio and our investments in HQLA, while we are waiting for the rule to be finalized.","And so now that there is a little bit more certainty there, we will look at how much securities balances we want on the balance sheet and look at the funding mix of those. But we have also got some long term debt that is going to rollover next year. And obviously, we will look to replace that but subject to where we see the balance sheet going. We think we have got some opportunity there to manage the securities portfolio now that the rules have been finalized and given how we feel about the strength of the organization.","Chris Spahr","And regarding tech, so I believe when I talked to you in the past, it's around 10% or so of your revenues are spent on technology. It's around maybe a little bit less than $700 million, with about 60-40, run the bank, change the bank. And as you bring more staff in-house, do you see either one of those changing?","Darren King","I guess we haven't, I don't think, disclosed or talked about what the tech budget is in specifics. I think that the 10% to 12% that you might be referencing as we talked about the compound annual growth rate of that part of the budget. And then the mix between kind of run the bank versus improve the bank, build the bank, whatever you want to describe, 60-40 is probably a reasonable estimate. It can move around from year-to-year, depending on what's going on.","We are making investments in new regulations like FDIC 370 or CECL. I don't know whether we would call that build the bank or run the bank. We are probably splitting hairs there. But at the end of the day, the total tech budget in the short term is running a little bit higher, because of the transition that we are making.","Our belief is that we will, all else equal, be flat with more on staff and less contractors as we go forward and then the growth rate from there wouldn't need to be at the 10% to 12% rate but would probably continue to run at a rate slightly above the bank average and that the investments we are making in technology would be offset by cost reduction somewhere else, as we gain productivity improvements from the tech spend.","Chris Spahr","And the new staff that you are bringing on, are they focused on, besides the FDIC and CECL, digital delivery, AIML, back office, cloud, transitioning apps to the cloud? Where are you putting the new hires to work?","Darren King","Well. We have got a whole host of things that we are working on. A bunch of them you named. Obviously some of the regulatory changes have been a big consumer of our tech team this year, as we get ready for FDIC 370 and CECL. But at the same time, we have been making consistent investments in a lot of the systems that are used, either by our customers or by our employees who interact with our customers.","We have been doing that in the commercial loan origination space. We have been doing it in the treasury management and merchant space, in the commercial part of the bank. We have been doing it in some of the M&A support that we do, in our institutional client services business. We have been doing it in customer facing things, both in our wealth management business as well as in the consumer business. We continue to make investments in cyber security, in data. And so it runs a whole host.","We are starting to migrate some applications to the cloud. Some of the newer ones often run on the cloud and we are doing some of that. So we have got a host of whole range of places where we are investing. But it always kind of starts with the customer, works backward and looks at where we and competition and where we need to make sure we are positioning the bank and then also looking for ways that we can obviously improve productivity or efficiency.","Chris Spahr","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","I think it's a little, it's easy to get lost, because it hits so many line items and everything like has a lag and timing issues. And I guess if you step back, like, was this a good acquisition like accretion or return on invested capital, however you want to measure it? If you just set aside the quarter-to-quarter stuff and where rates are in these escrow deposits like, do these all work?","Darren King","Ask that again, Brian. The first part of it, we missed.","Brian Foran","Just the mortgage servicing. Like it's hard to really parse apart everything. Like if you just think about it on a net basis, has the acquisition and the resulting business it built, did it work? Is it accretive? Is it going to be good for 2020? Or is there some underlying slippage? It's just hard to, there are so many moving parts and hit so many line items?","Darren King","Sure. I think the short answer is, we are still happy with the acquisition of the mortgage servicing rights. It's probably not quite the return that we thought when we first did it and that's affected by the timing of some of the charges that we are taking. But overall, we feel it's accretive and above our long term cost of capital, which is how we kind of evaluate everything. So we had some wiggle room built in, which you always do given the volatility of this business. And when we look at it, to your point, stepping back, we still feel good about it and are happy we did it.","Brian Foran","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi Darren.","Darren King","Good morning Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","A quick question. There seems obviously to be concerns about your IT spending and maybe not keeping up with some of the bigger banks. What measure would you recommend investors look at to show that you are as competitive as the big banks? Obviously the big banks can be splashy with the dollar signs that they are spending and yours will be a lot less because you are a smaller bank. But is deposits the preferred area to look as your deposit growth year-over-year was better than many of the big banks. But could you share with us what we should be looking at?","Darren King","Sure. It's a great question. Gerard. I guess I think the best place to look at is customer-based measures. So I would look at customer growth rates, customer attrition rates, satisfaction rates. So it could be JD Power, it could be Greenwich in the commercial and small business world. It could be some of the early research in the wealth space.","But I mean, at the end of the day, the number one thing you are investing in technology for is to help provide a great experience for your customers and make sure that you are on par with everyone else on things that are just kind of what we would call hygienics are expected and look for places where you can differentiate what you are doing. And one of the things to keep in mind when you compare the regional banks to the large ones is, the large banks have broader based businesses than we do. We don't have trading operations, for instance, which would consume a lot of dollars.","And I can't speak for everyone else, but what I can speak for M&T is, through all the acquisitions that we have done, we have never maintained duplicate systems. And so we are not carrying that expense and we don't need to incur the cost of running them or consolidating them. And so a lot is made of how much you spend. I think most important is, are you giving your customers the tools and capabilities and services that they are looking for and they let you know all the time.","You can kind of look at deposits as you pointed out, Gerard. The only thing you just got to watch it for, in my opinion, on deposits is, you can move the deposit balance number with rates a lot faster than you can with technology. And the one that's really hard to fake is transaction accounts or operating accounts whether they are consumers, small business, or commercial entities. And when we think about our tech investments, we are always thinking about those parts of the customer experience and how we can make it better.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess I want to parse through a lot of the moving parts around the NIM guidance, Darren and try to put a dollar sign around it. And I know there's a lot of uncertainty about rates and whatnot, but the four to nine basis points of NIMs pressure for every 25 basis point reduction at the short end, it looks like the fourth quarter one month LIBOR, the average should be, I don't know, I will probably have to sharpen my pencil here, but maybe 40, 50 basis points lower than what it was on average in the third quarter, especially if we see an October cut. I mean four to nine basis points, I mean it seems like, is it fair to say that it's going to be hard not to see some degradation in reduction in net interest income in the fourth quarter on a nominal dollar basis versus what you posted in the third quarter?","Darren King","Yes. I think that's right. So the actual margin, you have got the math right in looking at where Fed funds and LIBOR might be over the quarter. The print of the NIM might move around a little bit from that depending on where cash balances end up and how much more escrow comes on. But you are in the right ballpark. And then when you look at the dollar impact, it's going to come down.","When you look at the guidance that we have given, I think you should be able to figure out where we think it's roughly going to be in the fourth quarter. And the other wildcard is deposit repricing. But like we mentioned, we feel good about the progress that we made this quarter in spending over deposit pricing and we should start to see that come down this quarter.","And then the other thing that's a little bit tricky to gauge is just the pace of loan growth in the quarter, in particular, because the fourth quarter always seems to have some uptick. And then the question there is, when does it occur, right? You should start to see it a little earlier in the quarter in the auto floor plan balances. But oftentimes, we see a big December and you kind of wonder what drives seasonality. It's year-end and people looking to close deals for the tax year. And we always seem to see a spike in some of the loans that booked in December and obviously that will, depending on the timing impact, the dollars of net interest income.","Saul Martinez","Got it. I guess if I could just get one more in, a little bit more of a broader question. The downside of having sort of best-in-class profitability efficiency, deposit franchise is that it does leave you more vulnerable when the environment starts to turn a little bit worse. I guess the question is, just how do you think about sustaining profitability and creating value in that environment? How do you think about opportunities where you can grow? And I guess the gist of the question though is, can you do that on a standalone basis? Can you really? Or do you need to do something more strategic to really be able to sustain sort of the best-in-class type of profitability and operating metrics you have?","Darren King","I appreciate the question, because it's a really good one. And the strength of the franchise, as you point out, is both a blessing and a curse. And when you look at how we run the bank and how we think about the bank, we have always started with returns. And so to talk about the returns, I was pleased to hear you say that because that's our focus. And that thought process is what has kept us out of trouble and what has helped us make a lot of the investment decisions that we have done through time.","And sometimes it was acquiring servicing or sub-servicing business, because the returns made sense based on what was going on in the industry. It's helped us decide when to make loans and how to structure them, because if the returns don't make sense to us, we have tended to step away. And it's helped us price acquisitions and make sure that we are being thoughtful with capital and how we deploy it to grow with mergers and acquisitions.","And so when you look overall, one of the key things for us is making sure that we maintain those returns. And if that means we need to be patient in time and have a little bit less growth, we are okay with that because we would rather make sure we protect the profitability and the ability to generate capital so that we can make some of the investments that we are making. And if you look at really the last 12 months to 18 months, we had some outsized increases in the net interest margin because of the positioning of the balance sheet and the run-off of the Hudson City portfolio, which allowed us to grow the loans, deploy capital and increase the margin and we took advantage of that and we upped the investment that we are able to make in the franchise.","The reverse is true in that as we see rates come down and our net interest margin relative to the peers kind of resumes its more normal position of slightly above the median, we should be able to bring and anticipate bringing the expenses down commensurate with that. So you look across the different alternatives that you have of making loans, investing in other businesses, buying other banks or deploying excess capital to shareholders and think about the returns.","Obviously, the first place we want to invest is in the business and in our customers and this year we have been able to do that a little bit more with the loan growth that you have seen and we think we can continue to do that. But we don't feel pressure to have to get to a certain size or to buy some growth, either in the form of poor pricing or in poorly or ill-conceived acquisitions. We will continue to focus on returns and being patient and making sure that we are running a good bank. And that will leave us, we believe, with opportunities when they present themselves.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it.","Operator","There are no further questions. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Don MacLeod for any additional or closing remarks.","Don MacLeod","Again, thank you all for participating today and as always, if any clarification of any of the items in the call or news release is necessary, please contact our Investor Relations Department at 716-842-5138.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.
