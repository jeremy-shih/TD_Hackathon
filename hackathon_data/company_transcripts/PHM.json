At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc.\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer","Great. Thank you, operator. This is Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations for PulteGroup, and I want to welcome everyone to our call this morning to discuss our second quarter financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2014.","On the call today to discuss our results are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that copies of this morning\u2019s earnings release, along with the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today\u2019s call will be available on the site later today.","Please note that today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Jim and good morning everyone. I\u2019m extremely pleased with PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results, which show a continuation of a positive company and industry dynamics we discussed as part of our first quarter conference call and more broadly over the past 12 to 18 months. Within the U.S. housing market that remains on a steady recovery path, we are benefitting from company\u2019s specific initiatives that continue to generate gains and key financial metrics, consistent with our value creation strategy.","Reflecting with an ongoing recovery and demand, and overall favorable pricing environment, the value of our second quarter signups increased by 5%, as we once again realized the improved absorption paces over last year, we see these as positive signs for our business going forward.","As Bob will detail among the promising aspects of these gains, it is a meaningful increase in the performance of our Centex communities and the implications for potential future demand among entry-level buyers. It has been widely reported that the first time buyer has been underrepresented in this housing cycle. So improving demand at Centex communities is a very encouraging sign.","We also realized the solid increase in sales pace within our Del Webb communities. As we have talked about before, there is tremendous operating leverage to be realized with volume, so continued gains in Webb\u2019s absorption pace is important.","Within this demand environment, we continue to focus on maximizing profitability on each norm we sell. Consistent with this strategy, we realized a 12% increase in average selling price over the last year, along with favorable market conditions on our ongoing mixed shift, price gains were generated through specific pricing strategies that address everything from base house and option pricing to lot premiums and discounts.","Each is a dial; we can adjust to accommodate biogroups and local market conditions to help us achieve our goal of higher returns on invested capital in each community we operate. For the better price realization and initiatives to drive more efficient ongoing operations, we were again, successful in raising reported gross margins.","On a year-over-year basis, gross margin for the second quarter increased by 480 basis points to 23.6%. In fact, we have to look in history books all the way back to 2005 for these type of margins from PulteGroup. We are of course, pleased with the improvement in gross margin that we have been \u2013 we have generated in 2014, as well as over the past several years and see opportunities to continue the strength going forward.","Through a combination of pricing strategies, gains in operating efficiency and savings associated with lower interest costs, we see the potential for incremental gross margin improvement from here.","An insurance related charge taken in the quarter makes the year-over-year gains in our homebuilding operations a little harder to appreciate when you see earnings of $0.11 per share, up a $0.09 per share last year. However, when you adjust for the charges taken in both periods and the more normal tax rate in 2014, the meaningful and sustained improvement in our homebuilding operations is clear.","Given the gains we have realized in operating and financial performance, we are comfortable increasing our level of investment into the business, confident that we will be able to generate better returns on invested capital that we were delivering in the past. roughly 400 million of land spend for the quarter and 720 million for the first half of 2014 is the most we have invested in a number of years.","The increased investment is possible given our more efficient homebuilding operations and strong balance sheet, and it\u2019s consistent with our view of an ongoing recovery in housing demand. So our headwinds facing the housing industry including type credit availability, and in our view, the negatives are outlaid by the positives, such as the monthly jobs reports showing an economy generating more jobs than it had in the recent past.","Interest rates remaining low, even a lot of that continues to withdraw support from the system and inventories of new and existing homes remaining imbalance with reports about an under supplier product in some areas of the country. These conditions in content with a good pricing environment and continued increases in apartment lease rates, support our expectation for a continued albeit measured recovery in housing demand.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on the quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results demonstrate further success operating against our value creation strategies and driving improved operational performance and financial results. As I will detail, these improvements are evidence in our Q2 numbers.","Looking at our income statement, wholesale revenues in the second quarter were $1.2 billion, which is an increase of 2% over the comparable prior year period; the higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 12% increase in our average selling price to $328,000, partially offset by a 9% decrease in our closings to 3,798 homes.","Consistent with recent quarters, we realized price increases at many of our communities and within each of our brands. For the second quarter, the 12% average increase in selling prices included a 13% increase to $396,000 in our Pulte communities, a 9% increase to $325,000 in our Del Webb communities and a 3% increase to $202,000 in our Centex communities. We continue to experience a shift in the mix of homes closed to move-up and active adult product.","For the second quarter, 45% of closings were from Pulte communities, 32% were from Del Webb and 23% were from Centex. in Q2 of 2013, the mix of closings was 46% Pulte, 27% Del Webb and 27% Centex.","Our reported gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, which represents a gain of 480 basis points, compared with last year. Our margins benefited from the higher prices and mix shifts, I noted as well as lower interest cost. I think it\u2019s important to highlight that we believe our margins are being enhanced by our strategic pricing model, which seems to maximize lot premiums and option dollars within the final selling price of the home.","We continue to realize gains through this initiative as lot premiums and option revenues per closing in the second quarter increased by 23% and 14% respectively to $12,000 and $47,000 per unit. Also supporting the expansion margins was a reduction in sales discounts, which dropped 90 basis points from last year to 1.7%. In dollar terms, discounts were only $5,700 per home, down from $7,900 last year. We\u2019ve highlighted that we don\u2019t expect discounts to decline significantly from these levels.","Along with capturing pricing opportunities, we continue to expand our use of commonly managed plans to help insure that we\u2019re building the best home for the lowest price. In the second quarter, 39% of our deliveries were from commonly managed plans. This is an increase from the 30% we reported in the first quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased with our progress on this metric as we have grown this percentage from just 13% one year ago. We are clearly on track to meet or exceed our goal of 40% of our closing from commonly managed plans by the end of 2014.","Given the benefits of commonly managed plans, a favorable pricing dynamics were experienced in the market and the impact of our deleveraging the balance sheet over the last few years. We continue to see opportunity for further margin expansion from here although there will be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Based on our current backlog, we expect the margins for the balance of the year to be consistent with that\u2019s slightly higher than our margin this quarter.","SG&A costs for the second quarter were $230 million, or 18.4% of home sale revenues, compared with $151 million, or 12.3% last year. The year-over-year increase in SG&A was primarily driven by a charge of $84 million, reported in the quarter for increased insurance reserves.","The adjustment to our reserves was driven by costs associated with siding repairs in certain previously completed communities in the west. Beyond the direct cost of the repairs, the negative development in the period to use the insurance filing impacted our actuarial estimates for incurred, but not reported for potential future claims, the combination of higher costs incurred and the resulting increase and estimates for future expenses throughout the second quarter charge. Repairs are in process in the impacted communities and we\u2019re working with homeowners and contractors to ensure the work is completed efficiently, and with minimal disruption to the residence.","Excluding this charge, SG&A costs in the period were consistent with expenditures in Q1 of this year and with previous guidance. Financial services reported pretax income of $9 million for the quarter, compared with $16 million in Q2 of last year. The reduction in pretax income for the period was the result of lower origination volumes and the more competitive operating conditions that continue to exist within the mortgage industry.","Capture rate for the period was unchanged from last year and consistent with Q1 of this year mortgage put back request remains at very low levels. Inclusive of the $88 million in charges for insurance and office relocation costs, pretax income for the second quarter of 2014 was $58 million. Prior year pretax income of $38 million included charges totally $67 million for contractual dispute, debt repurchases and corporate relocation.","As you can see, our operating performance excluding these items was significantly improved. Income tax expense for the period was $26 million, or an effective tax rate of 38%. This is consistent with our previous guidance and taxes in 2014 would be approximately 39%. Prior year tax expenses only $2 million, or an effective tax rate of only 5% that the company is yet to reverse deferred tax asset valuation allowance.","Net income for the second quarter was $42 million, or $0.11 per share including $0.14 per share of charges recorded in the period. For the second quarter of 2013, net income was $36 million, or $0.09 per share, including charges of $0.17 per share. Again, this year\u2019s net income reflects the 38% tax rate, compared with the 5% rate last year.","Looking at other operating metrics, we have 6,321 homes under construction of which 15% were spec at the end of the quarter. Spec reduction is consistent with prior year and prior quarter, but particularly important; however, finished specs sold less than 300 houses, or well below one per community.","During the quarter, we put 6,700 lots under control and invested $395 million in land acquisition and development. we approved more deals in the quarter than we have in any quarters since 2006, including the approval of three new communities to serve future active adult buyers, continuing recent trends about three quarters of the deals are raw meaning that land development is required. So these transactions will support production in 2016 and beyond.","We had 126,000 lots under control at the end of the quarter, of which 26% were controlled via option, 24% of the lots under control are finished, and we have another 18% under development. At $395 million for the quarter, our land spend is clearly increasing. For the year-to-date period, we have spent approximately $720 million. We continue to target a full year land spend of $2 billion for 2014, or recognize it will be a challenge to spend an additional $1.3 billion over the next six months.","As we\u2019ve highlighted before we are comfortable with this, we continue to invest in a disciplined manner with a focus on better located positions and acceptable risk adjusted returns. It\u2019s important to note that we continue to see good opportunities, as evidenced by the level of spend we approved during the second quarter.","along with our higher land investments, we have also increased our repurchase activity in Q2. In total, we acquired 2.8 million shares for $53 million, or $19.12 per share. As of June 30, 2014, we had $137 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I would also highlight that we entered into a new three-year $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility yesterday. the revolver, which includes an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the facility to $1 billion, replaces a letter of credit facility that have set to expire later this year and provide data financial flexibility for the company.","Moving past our financial statements, the dollar value of signups in the quarter increased 5% over the last year to $1.6 billion. On a unit basis, net new orders totaled 4,778 homes, which is down just 2% from last year, despite a 6% decrease in community count. As Richard highlighted, this is the second quarter in a row where we experienced higher absorption paces. Looking at this by brand, net signups decreased 1% at Pulte, and 5% at Centex and 2% for Del Webb.","Q2 absorption paces were down at 8% at Pulte, but up 11% at Del Webb and 26% at Centex. A 26% increase at Centex solves a 29% improvement in year-over-year absorptions in the first quarter of this year, certainly part of the increase is driven by the overall strength of demand in Texas. but the trend in Centex weren\u2019t close monitoring and there may be a growing opportunity with the entry-level buyer.","We ended the quarter with 589 communities, which is a decrease of 6% from the end of last year. Q2 community account was flat with the first quarter of this year and in line with guidance that we expected to operate from approximately 560 to 580 communities throughout 2014. The stability across the headquarters hides a fact that this is a very active year, which we plan to open approximately 190 new communities over the full year. Our quarter end backlog with 8,179 homes valued $2.8 billion, which compares with prior year backlog units, and dollars of 8,558 and $2.7 billion respectively.","The average price of our homes and backlog is up 7% over the last year to $339,000 and up from $336,000 in Q1 of this year. Overall, I am extremely pleased with our results for the quarter even more encouraging our improving absorption paces with better pricing, growing margin and increased investment put us in a very strong position moving forward.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Bob. As Bob just detailed we continue to experience strong buyer demand in the quarter which generated increased absorptions and allowed us to realize higher selling prices. While we appreciate that housing data can be volatile from month-to-month, we\u2019d remain optimistic about overall conditions and very encouraged demand through the first six months of the year.","Looking at conditions in the second quarter on a more regional basis, on the east coast conditions didn\u2019t changed all that much in the first quarter this year. In that activity was stronger as you move from the north to the south. Buyer activity remains particularly strong in Carolinas, and throughout the State of Florida.","Market conditions in Washington DC however were still challenging in the quarter. Conditions in the middle part of the country were positive in the second quarter, similar to our experience on the East Coast demand strengthened as you move from north to south. Texas remains one of the strongest areas of the country with exceptional demand across all markets of Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio. Relative to the first quarter of the year demand conditions got better as we move past the tough winter.","Finally, moving to our western markets the patterns of the past several quarters continued as we experienced strong demand in Northern California and Pacific Northwest, well our markets in the Southwestern states of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada are good, but not as strong as this time last year. As the U.S. economy continues to improve we would anticipate that these markets will benefit.","In terms of demand for the first few weeks of July, we have seen the typical summer slowdown, but the market specific trends we experienced through the first six months of the year are generally unchanged.","In closing my thanks to all of our employees who are working extremely hard to help us drive our improved operating results and we are doing an amazing job opening 190 new communities this year. Thanks for your time this morning and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time we will open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time in this call. We asked that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And Anastasia if you\u2019ll explain the process, we will get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Thanks, good morning everyone and nice quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","The first question I had was your comments on Centex and the continued positive sales pace, you mentioned part of it was driven by Texas and I just wanted to get a sense of its sales pace was up in the other regions where Centex is more dominant or how much really Texas was responsible for this and part of this is \u2013 is just a reformulation or mix benefit from some newer communities as well?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Yes, Mike this is Richard. It\u2019s a combination of Texas and other markets, to be clear the entry-level does appear to be improving in other markets as well. We happen to have the biggest percentage of Centex communities in Texas, and as everyone knows the job growth in Texas is strong that\u2019s why we highlighted, but it appears to be a broadening improvement for the entry-level categories?","Michael Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Okay. And just secondly the gross margins continue to be great and you\u2019ve showed a lot of improvement there, one of the competitors this morning mentioned that they\u2019ve maybe taken some actions to improved sales pace in the market, which might suggest a modest negative impact on gross margin. Is this something that you think might continue going forward and kind of spread to the industry or have you seen this from a competitive standpoint \u2013 by other builders or in certainly other markets?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Mike, we are definitely to run on the company for the highest returns on invested capital and we are not pushing discounts as a matter of fact, as Bob indicated discounts drop year-over-year to an incredibly low level, while lot premiums and option revenue increased. So, I can\u2019t speak to what competitors are doing? I am not seeing broad-based discounting across the board. I think inventory levels candidly are too low and I would point out that the very strong quality land, that we have been buying the land several years, along with our return strategy is supporting our higher margins. As Bob indicates we expecting to continue.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates. Your line is open.","Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates","","Good morning, guys. Congratulations on another strong quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Thanks, Ivy.","Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates","If you could just please talk to a little bit \u2013 with the charge reserves on the $90 million for the siding, this is completely separate from the construction defects that you reserve for few years ago. And, just understanding making sure that separate, and then, my follow-up is just as you thinking about the mortgage competitive, mortgage environment. What are you seeing more in terms of lenders willingness to maybe remove some of the credit overlays. As you deliver loans to Fannie and Freddie is the consumer actually seeing a better price as a result for the competitive pressures and maybe more specific within the credit buckets, recognizing that you are typically dealing with the better quality borrower, but you\u2019ve also indicated the Centex, this is picking up, so is that a function and also lending improving to that bucket. Thanks and congratulations again.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Okay. Thank you. So, Bob do you want to take the first part.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","","Sure. So the charge IVY is for siding issues and it is construction defect work. So, we are repairing siding issues that we have identified and the mechanics of this are, we\u2019ve got certain communities where we have costs and then looking at the actuarial analysis. When we saw that activity the actuaries look at that and say okay, if we see it today, we have to extrapolate across the universe of production. So, it is actually both specific to certain communities siding issues and then a extrapolation for incur but not reported plans.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Okay. And then, Ivy, with regard to the mortgage environment, I would say credit appears to be easing just on the margin on the edges if you will, I do believe that is some of the improvement in the entry level, I do think however, the majority of the improvement in the entry-level is job growth related. I don\u2019t think credit has moved much, but it appears to be easing just on the edges, we\u2019ve seen a very slight increase in credit availability as measured by MBA in their statistics.","Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates","","Great. Thanks, guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Thank you.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS Investment Bank. Your line is open.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Good morning, David.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","My first question, I want to follow-up on one of the Bob\u2019s comment earlier about kind of where, what\u2019s happening in the Centex business segment and the higher absorption rate and the trend, keeping an eye on the trend. What I am trying to get an idea is, what\u2019s the trigger points for you guys to start maybe focusing more land acquisition on Centex communities? Is that you hit a certain absorption paces is a certain confidence in the economy. What are you looking for when you are examining that trend and the improvements you are seeing to get more confident in your land acquisition in that segment?","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","","The simple answer is as you heard Richard say it is return, so as we look at land transactions in the market, that the teams are agnostic to brand and so they\u2019ve got opportunities to invest in any one of our brands. And so I think what would drive increased investments in Centex is a continuation of the pace increases if you are seeing here, because it still has lower ASP\u2019s, still has lower margins. And so we need higher paces, so it would be that improving environment for the buyer and Texas is a great example that job market there is really strong, Richard highlighted this, strong jobs are driving consumer confidence and that buyer is therefore buying in more volume and so you would see us invest more in that land when we see that activity.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","That\u2019s great color. My second question was on the three new active adult communities that were I think put under contract you mentioned earlier in the commentary. Can you give us just a kind of high level are these replacement communities for things that are rolling off, these incrementally and what might be different or maybe the same about those relative to the existing Del Webb communities if you kind of look at the rolling off and rolling off pattern?","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Great question, these are largely the replacement communities there is one that is a fresh community, what I think you see different from the historical Del Webb is they are smaller they range and size from 600 units to 1,200 units, we think we will be in and out of them and say five years it will have a slightly smaller aminity package to what I \u2013 you probably heard me refer to as the crew shift Del Webb, if its continuation on an existing community it may have of shared aminities but typically, we had a club house it might not have a golf course any more, it will have walking trials. So again a little bit smaller and I think we\u2019ve talked about this for a couple of years those 5,000 unit communities are likely not featured,","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","David, everything Bob mentioned, is all driven around return its all part of the Pulte story.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","","Great, thank you guys. Nice quarter.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eli Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to go back to the first time buyer and credit for a minute or so, Richard you talked I maybe think using on the margin, is there anything else you can see over this next six, nine months whether its conversations in the industry with your mortgage trends with people and do you see or maybe that change more, maybe that would change more incrementally and then also on the first time buyer. Do you think there is any holdback of them buying due to lack of available supply in the market so it\u2019s really much more back to your first one which is really job growth accelerating within that core buyer? Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Yes. So I will answer and a reverse Eli, I think the majority of a problem is a combination of tight credit and jobs the combination there, overall, I don\u2019t think there is a lack of supply for that category, I think the industry can ramp up to build for that category, on there is certainly some supply shortages but the majority of the issues I believe are tight credit and jobs. With regards to credits potentially easing from here mortgage finance reform legislatively is likely dead for this year as I think everyone knows the job\u2019s in (indiscernible) didn\u2019t make it too far in congress, so we are working as a group of collective large builders to push the administration particularly to work on administrative solutions to the credit box, which we do believe can have some impact that would be things like changing FHA fees things like that. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the sometimes tough to get done and I do believe that will take sometime, but by clarifying a put rules by insuring that the definition of qualified mortgages and qualified residential mortgages is very clear by focusing on FHA fees, things like that we do believe there is some administrative actions that know what could take, as he heads up FHFA would be outside of legislative arena. And we are working on that, we are not holding our breath at, anything is going to happen dramatically to help that. It\u2019s going to take sometime for credit to years in my view.","Eli Hackel \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you very much.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Thank you, good morning guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Richard you talk a little bit about the July rebound or is it July being pretty normal seasonally and we\u2019ve heard from various places that June absorptions were down like 15% across the industry et cetera. Could you talk about how your order progression was during the quarter and whether you saw that type of absorption drop in the quarter?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Yes, Steve. We saw fairly seasonal typical trend. And April and May were stronger than June. We didn\u2019t see a dramatic fall off in June it was very typical summer seasonal which is continued into July.","Stephen East \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. And then we\u2019ve also heard over the last three or four months that generally traffic it\u2019s been much better than the conversion into orders, I was wondering if you all were seeing that and then if I could just ask one question back on the gross margins. Can you help me reconcile a little bit the commonly managed four plans jump from 30% to almost 40% that the gross margin stayed about flat? How do we reconcile those two and is that going to be an ongoing thing there.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Okay, I\u2019ll take it crack it both and then maybe Bob might want to add any color. On traffic versus conversion, we are continuing to see good traffic and conversions respectable I would just again say within the balance of a typical summer slowdown. So not a lot of movement Steve either way on either metrics I would say we still had good traffic and respectable conversion both marginally down given the summer season. On gross margin performance the commonly managed plans or better margin product and we are excited about the 39%, but many things go into the margin performance including specifically mix for the quarter. And we have indicated that we would have quarter-to-quarter volatility, our margins even though they were sequentially down I think about 20 basis points they continue to be at a very high range and as Bob indicated based in our backlog we see opportunities in next couple of quarters in them to be in this range or slightly higher from here. So we\u2019re pleased with our overall margins and mix influences things from quarter-to-quarter. I don\u2019t know Bob any other color.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","I only things I want to add is, one things that we\u2019ve highlighted about these commonly managed plans that we think is sort of the hidden gem, is that our absorption paces are higher with them. And I think its contributing to the absorption pace increases you are seeing from us, which is equally as important to return for us the margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America","","Thanks and good morning. First question I wanted to ask was about the profile of land spend, you folks mentioned that you approved the most number of deals I think in, since maybe and going back to the housing boom, but at the same time you also said that $2 billion land authorization, it will be tough to get there. So I was just trying to reconcile those two, does that imply that, you\u2019ve shifted your land purchases towards much longer deals, where the cash flows are more back end weighted or is that, just a reflection of the fact that the trajectory of housing this year is probably turned out to be a little bit slower than most of us originally expected.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","","Yes, I would actually characterize it is that the change to a certain degree in what we are buying, there isn\u2019t much finished lot availability out there. So we\u2019re buying raw land, and so while our dollars out the door today, it will be a challenge to get the $2 billion; we\u2019ve actually committed a fairly significant amount in terms of what will develop in 2015 and 2016.","So you\u2019ll see spending increasing in out years because of what we\u2019ve done this year. And we think we\u2019ll get close to the $2 billion, we are just not sure we\u2019ll get all the way there. And it\u2019s because we\u2019ve continued to tell our folks don\u2019t chase deals. This is you\u2019ve got authorization to go spend money, but don\u2019t do it foolishly. And so the discipline that they are exhibiting is going to make it a little bit of challenge to get the $2 billion, but you\u2019ll still see a significant increase over fiscal 2013 and we like the land that we are buying.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Nishu, it\u2019s Richard, I want to add two things what Bob said. Number one, we are seeing some delays in entitlement and municipal issues which candidly or somewhat out of our control just based on processing times to get things through the cycle and that\u2019s causing some of the delay.","And secondly, I want to be crystal clear, we are not lengthening the land supply in a profile of the deals we are doing as a matter of fact. We are doing our best to make them strong returners, which generally means a little bit shorter positions clearly than the company is buying in the past. So there is no change in our profile over the last two or three years that we\u2019ve been indicating ROIC first.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America","Got it. Great. And kind of following up on that, 190 new communities I think you mentioned I think you\u2019ll be opening this year. So a significant amount of turnover as well as accelerate pace of taking land under control. So do we begin to see a more significant pace of community comp expansion in looking into 2015?","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Nishu, we haven\u2019t commented on that yet, and we are sticking with our guidance of 560 to 580 for this year and as we get closer into either late Q3 or Q4 we\u2019ll provide some guidance for 2015. But it\u2019s too early for us to speculate on those numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open. If you are on mute, please unmute.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","I\u2019ll apologize for that. I was muted. Thanks very much for the color, the quarter, interesting about the entry-level would set to see where that goes. I wanted to ask you a question about labor and the ability to construct homes, particularly I\u2019m interested we all know that labor shortage is that been something that the builders have talked about for kind of while and obviously there is cyclical cycle reasons associated with the severity, the downtrend that have made labor and particularly short supply. My question is, is there \u2013 is it more difficult or more easier to get labor to build your entry-level product versus some of your higher end products. And specifically what I\u2019m getting, do you see a recovery in the entry-level demand? Do you anticipate that labor shortages will constrict your ability to meet that demands with product? Or is it because or could it be that because entry-level homes don\u2019t maybe required the same amount of finished skills, trend and so forth that actually you can take some lesser skilled labor and still get those homes build at the entry-level?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Steve, we\u2019re not seeing any difference in labor availability for entry-level versus a more luxury focused product for us. I\u2019ll say labor is tight in the industry particularly for unskilled trades, drywall, looping and things like that. And clearly there is some constraint on ability to close backlog in the near-term; it\u2019s just a timing issue. So you may have units moved from one month or one quarter to another. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big problem for the industry, but it could cause some minor disruptions frankly not unusual from past recoveries, but no not a lot of change in segment availability of labor.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, that\u2019s encouraging, great. And then you made a comment in your prepared remarks about land and I just want to make sure that I got the numbers. You mentioned I think that 24% of your lots were finished. I wanted to make sure I understood was that the owned, 24% of owned lots or 24% of your controlled lots. I want to know how many owned finished lots you have?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","It was controlled Steven, and we\u2019ll see if we can get that number for you. We had 24,683 finished owned lots.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Which would be 27% of all finished lots we have.","Stephen Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","20% of all\u2026.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","All right, 20% of all owned lots. Sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Richard you talked about approvals impacted, you commented on approval process impacting your land spend. Could you comment on what the discipline side i.e. your returns says about what land prices are in various markets, this is my first question.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Yes, Ken, we\u2019ve certainly seen a significant escalation over the past 12 months to 18 months in land prices; they do appear to be moderating to some degree. However, I would tell you that the discipline that we are exhibiting with a very capital constrained focus internally to drive higher returns continues to lead us toward challenges to meet the overall lands and goals that we have. As Bob indicated we hope to get to the $2 billion level, but we are not going force it. So overall we are pleased with our discipline, we think it served as well, we think it\u2019s one of the reasons that our margins have held up as well as they have. And frankly one of the reasons our paces are doing well simply because of the quality of the land we are buying. So continued more of the same I would say is in our future.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay, and than my second question broadly related how you are running the capital structure. Could you give us a sense of what you think the company will do, if your revenues are growing let say 10% or X%? What is the cash flow cycle imply about your yield or your free cash flow generates the potential, the buyback stock as you did \u2013 as you did in the quarter given that you are not going to be a cyclical on the capital investment cycle.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","","Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Ken and as a company, we continue to \u2013 we think to exhibit balance with our capital allocation strategy and I think you can expect more of the same from the company, we reintroduced the dividend last year to a reasonably nice level and we stepped up our share repurchases in Q2. And so I would expect the company to continue to exhibit balance. Now that our returns were strong as they are, our first priority will be to put it in the business. But candidly, we don\u2019t want to delude our returns. So we want to make sure that we\u2019re buying the right lands.","So I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re going to have plenty cash available to do a multitude of things, and I would suggest that continuing to return funds to shareholders through dividend and buyback is likely in our future as part of our balanced process.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Right. And I guess, if you think about invest in the business like you said, and you\u2019re going to be holding land and let\u2019s say two-year. How do you gauge your discipline relative to what you want to invest today, based upon where you think the market is going to be because that\u2019s the real thing, right. We have two-year, 50% growth, that\u2019s different than a steady 10% or 15% growth which will yield us different element of cash flow? Thank you.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, I think it\u2019s tough to predict that on the future too far, Ken. I would suggest for the near to medium-term, we like the conservative pasture that we\u2019ve taken and we\u2019ll, we realize that the large cash balance is a non-earning asset and we\u2019d like to deploy it, we just don\u2019t want to do anything dramatic or sudden to try to tie in the market if you will. So stay tune for further clarity and commentary on that as the picture become little clear in the future for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning guys, a nice quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Thanks, Robert.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hi, Robert.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","How much \u2013 what\u2019s your upside do you think there is gross margin, the standardized floor plans have been fantastic, very positive impact. Do you still see opportunity for upside?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Bob, we indicated for the next couple of quarters. We see things in this range are slightly improved. Beyond that long-term, we don\u2019t want to provide a lot of guidance, we certainly like the benefit from commonly managed plans, we like our discipline, but I\u2019ll highlight something that Bob indicated is certainly a nice margin story and we want to keep it going, but it\u2019s about return for the company. So we\u2019re going to continue to make good decisions based on return overall. So we like where margins are headed for the foreseeable future.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","That\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve been in the homebuilding industry for a long time. Do you think we\u2019re transitioning from early cycle to mid cycle of the recovery? If you could just kind of give us your view where we are in terms of the evolution in that process? that would be great. Thanks.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Yes, I think housing has several good years ahead. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re mid-cycle yet, frankly in my view. But I do think it\u2019s a slow and steady path upward from here, I\u2019d like to tell our folks internally my best projection is that I don\u2019t see anything causing a sharp increase in overall demand, nor do I see anything causing a sharp decrease in demand. I think a slow and steady recovery is the most likely one, which is kind of what we\u2019ve seen. There are a couple of headwinds that we historically might not have had in housing recovery, such as job growth that is good, but not great anti-credit, but the same token, those things appear to be getting better slowly, but surely. So that would be what I would expect.","One other thing Bob just mentioned is that the recovery now appears to be taking on regional and local geographic characteristics, which is very typical of a normal housing recovery. I think we transitioned probably late last year, or early this year from the sort of macro view, or housing was horrible for several years, and then we had a couple of years where housing was really good everywhere. Now, it\u2019s becoming much more about local economies and local geographies, and that\u2019s normal. So as we indicated, Texas has got great job growth, and it\u2019s strong and DC has got social job growth and it\u2019s not as strong, that feels normal to us. So again, to summarize slow and steady from here is my best guess for many years.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Adam P. Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Richard, in the last couple of questions, you\u2019ve mentioned returns a lot, I was wondering if you could, in one particular, you said returns are strong now. So I just wondering if you could be even more specific and talk about what you\u2019re referring to whether it\u2019s something margins, or if it\u2019s ROEs, or ROICs and what \u2013 where you are versus where are your targets and what might be achievable?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Yes. We are clearly focused internally on our invested capital. So, it\u2019s ROIC that I\u2019m referring to, and all of our folks in the field I\u2019ve been running the business. this is the fourth year in a row, with a focus on a combination of margins, SG&A leverage and asset turns. And if you kind of put that in the triangle, right in the middle of it, we\u2019d kind of stamp ROIC.","so we feel like our returns are very strong today, and we feel like we can keep them in this range, or higher from here. We don\u2019t think that our balance sheet is completely being utilized. In other words, we still have a number of lots that are long positions. and as we cycle through those, and we replace them with more term friendly deals. I think that can help the denominator, and obviously, we\u2019re working on the numerator as well.","So, it\u2019s hard to predict where returns can go, but we intend to be a high return in builder through the cycle, certainly, not as higher returns in the down cycle, as in the up cycle. but we want to be focused on returns from here on now, because we do believe that metric is the most important metric to drive shareholder return over the long run.","Adam P. Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Will Randow with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Will Randow \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","You bet, Will.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey, Will.","Will Randow \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hey, in regards to your land spend, are you guys kind of augmenting that towards Texas and Georgia versus some of the stronger markets. I think we are seeing, I don\u2019t know if you are as well?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","We actually focus our investment on a couple of things. One is to maintain relative market share and the markets where we operate. The other is obviously where we see the opportunity for increased investment. So it will be a function of how well they\u2019re investing today. We don\u2019t say okay, if we\u2019re going to invest 100 in total ex-percent goes here, here, here, it\u2019s static. It actually moves over time. so certainly, the improved operating environment in Texas is one that has interested in investing more. So they have a fair amount of capital. But we are trying to maintain relative market share in all of the markets where we operate.","Will Randow \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thanks for that. And then just in terms of, on the balance sheet, give me some of credit metrics, do you intent to refinance your 2015, 2016 maturities from Centex. and I guess overall is your goal being investment grade, or is it just more than returns on capital?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on individual debt offerings. What I will tell you is that there are very, very expensive. So as we look at all of our debt over time, if we were to make an investment to buy it back, because we can get some positive yield out of it, and that\u2019s a challenge with some of the pricing that we\u2019re seeing on our paper.

O\u2019Shaughnessy","","14.1, so flat with last year.","Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay, great. And then my second question in a little different take on the lands, can you comment on the valuations you\u2019re seeing in private builders who are willing to sell, and all those valuations in line with what you\u2019re looking forward with the right strategy and could you potentially go out and do some deals and buy some of these private builders to accelerate that land growth that you\u2019re talking about and then is that two building target this year?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Certainly, we see all the transactions that are coming out, the stuff that gets announced, we see these. And I would say the answer is, yes we could potentially be doing transactions, but we\u2019d look at them as typically just a land transaction. So we are putting the same return requirements on them as we are on any particular land transactions in a market.","Oftentimes, when people come to market, they\u2019ve got fairly lost the expectations for price. We haven\u2019t seen anything that was compelling to us to chase, but that doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we look at them and we\u2019re interested, we\u2019re a buyer and seller of land, it\u2019s part of the equation here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar. Your line is open.","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So using your risk-weighted focus on ROICs, ultimately, where do you see options as a percent of total land under control long-term and how long do you think you\u2019ll get there?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Jim, we\u2019d like to drive option desires we possibly we can. we\u2019ve been really pleased with our ability to do so, given our focus on returns. to some extent, that can be dictated by the seller, in some instances, it\u2019s not available, but Bob, if you have any more color on that.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is options can take on different looks and feels. If you\u2019ve got a finished lot option transaction, it\u2019s different than one where you\u2019ve got raw land where you\u2019re optioning partials of it, as you go forward. And for us that can extend it to what generates the best return risk-weighted.","So if we are buying raw land, the option \u2013 we want the option to have risk transfer elements to it, whereas if you\u2019re buying finished lots, it\u2019s a little bit simpler to work through. So what we\u2019ve been doing now, we are increasing our percentage of option transaction. but again, they are typically raw, where you may have a 600 lot community and we take the first 200 down and option the second 200.","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Research","","And on the finished land side, the options of finished land. When do you think you could start to do that to a greater extent? When will the developers regain those naturally held to do those kind of deals?","Richard J.

Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I was wondering, it\u2019s great kind of confidence that you talked about in terms of the gross margins during the back half of the year, is that flatter or slightly up. Just wondering about that how much that is the view that the \u2013 what you\u2019re doing internally in terms of the common plans and the price optimization is offsetting on the slower home price appreciation and from a high land cost.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Yes, Dan, I think it\u2019s all of the above, I\u2019ll will tell you, I\u2019m very pleased with our internal focus on commonly managed plans and don\u2019t rule out that the stats Bob keeps given each quarter around lot premiums and options those are \u2013 and discounts, our internal focus on isolating each of those metrics and trying to optimizing them helps. So it\u2019s clearly a combination of all of the above when you have as many moving parts as we do going in it\u2019s hard to isolate it to anyone, but collectively that\u2019s what where we get.","Daniel Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, and second question you talked about the strong absorption on the Centex side, but then in terms of pricing with Centex it was up less, (indiscernible) achieved in terms of more (indiscernible) lower price points at first to pushing price less in Centex than in many other brands.","Robert T. O\u2019Shaughnessy","","Yes, certainly our operators are trying to get price for ever they can, they are also trying to get return and so phases get to there. It\u2019s interesting we were talking earlier, yes the Texas market had outsized first time absorption increases but the non-Texas markets were up 13%. So of that 20 plus percent pace increase it\u2019s not just Texas. So the return characteristics are not so much in that business about generating higher prices be with that buyer is somewhat limited to the down payment they can come up with.

O\u2019Shaughnessy","","We haven\u2019t given any color on next year, obviously we\u2019ve been absent debt transaction dividend the share repurchases were going to be cash flow generative this year and substantially.

Dugas, Jr.","","Buck, we\u2019ve talked about it, and this is Richard. We\u2019ve talked about internally and we think the Pulte brand allows us to expand up nicely. as a matter of fact, we have several communities operating in the 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s, and even a couple over a million with that brand just fine. So one of the things we\u2019d recognize is that even though, the margin and return characteristics in that segment are very strong and good, they typically represent above 10% of the total housing market plus or minus. So we think we can serve that very effectively with the Pulte brand.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay. so you wouldn\u2019t think you need to make an acquisition outside of the company to try to establish a different presence or different brands?","Richard J.

We have enough experience with the Pulte brand and with construction techniques, design et cetera that we believe we can stretch that name into that category. but again, we want to be selective, we like the fact that we are diversified with our portfolio.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay, thanks.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","","Thank you. All right. I apologize, Will, I remember your second question and it was about the rating agencies and investment grade. it is certainly the business that we\u2019re running; we think certainly, warrant consideration for investment grade. we\u2019ve shared that our thoughts on that with the rating agencies. The one thing I would say is it\u2019s not the overarching reason we do things. So, again, we think we actually warrant consideration for investment grade today and we\u2019re running the business in the way I think that is supportive of that type of ratings. But it doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t look at doing things differently if we thought it was better for shareholders.","Operator","","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer.","James P. Zeumer","","Great, thank you, operator. I know you have a lot of other calls to be held today.

I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our second quarter financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman and CEO; Ryan Marshall, President; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President-Finance and Controller.","A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later.","Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now, let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Over the five plus years, we have been operating under our Value Creation strategy. The company has moved through several different stages as our operating and financial results progressed. When we started back in 2011, our initial focus was on fixing our fundamental business performance along with strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing overall returns on invested capital.","Having made significant progress toward achieving these initial operating and financial objectives, in 2013, we were in a position to begin materially increasing investment in the business. Our land acquisition spend on an annual basis the last few years doubled from $600 million or 11% of revenue in 2013 to $1.2 billion or 21% of revenue in 2015.","While the dollars grew, our underlying discipline has not wavered. We have continued to invest in higher- returning, shorter-duration projects that are closer to city centers, allowing the company to maintain high margins and returns through this timeframe. As we have talked about on recent calls, 2016 is the year this increased investment begins to pay off as we have now reached an inflection point toward higher growth in the business.","The earnings release we issued this morning demonstrates this point as our second quarter results show another quarter of strong year-over-year growth across a variety of important business metrics including sign-ups which increased 11% in units and 21% in value, closings which increased by 27%, revenues which increased 41% to $1.8 billion, earnings per share which gained 21% on a reported basis and was significantly higher when you adjust for the charges and benefits in the respective reporting periods and with our backlog value up 21% to $3.7 billion, our highest since 2007, we are in an excellent position to realize further growth over the remainder of 2016.","It is clear that after three years of increased investment in the business, we are driving meaningful growth across the operations. While our increased land investments should bring growth for several years to come, we have not forgotten that homebuilding is a cyclical business which is why we are already planning for the future.","Value Creation was designed over five years ago to help maximize shareholder value through an entire housing cycle. With this in mind, in addition to announcing our strong second quarter financial results, this morning's earnings release highlighted additional actions we are now taking as we move through the housing cycle.","After four years during which our investment in new land grew significantly, we plan to slow the rate of growth in our new investment in 2017 and beyond. With 143,000 lots currently under control, we maintain a very strong land pipeline on which to operate over the next few years.","Our stated capital allocation priorities of first investing in high-returning land and then returning excess funds to shareholders have not changed. As such, given a moderated level of land spend in future years, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to allow us to increase our share repurchase activities.","As stated in the release, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $1.5 billion. As also stated, we expect to utilize that authority over the next 18 months through repurchases of $250 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and an additional $1 billion in 2017.","Along with looking to create value through our allocation of capital over time, we are also taking action to create value through maximizing efficiencies within our operations. Over the past several years, we have worked extremely hard to raise our operating margin from the bottom quartile of the homebuilding peers to among the industry leaders. We want to maintain and as possible enhance our relative position.","To help realize this objective, we plan to lower our SG&A spend from an estimated 10% of revenues in 2016 to 9% of revenues or lower in 2017. While we expect to realize a portion of this leverage benefit from increased revenues, we are also working to take unnecessary overhead out of the business. The fact is that after five years, many of the core homebuilding disciplines put in place at the outset of Value Creation are now part of the company's standard operating practices and are embedded in our muscle memory. As such, there are opportunities to remove some of these costs.","As I wrap up my initial comments, let me say that I'm very proud of the excellent second quarter results and pleased with how well we are positioned for the future. Furthermore, I believe the additional actions we are announcing today with regard to future capital allocation and overheads will help ensure we continue building value for shareholders going forward.","Now, let me turn over the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Building on our strong Q1 results, PulteGroup's second quarter financials are highlighted by significant growth and performance gains in the business.","Looking at the second quarter's homebuilding operations, home sale revenues were at $1.8 billion, which represents an increase of 41% over last year. The significant increase in revenue was driven by a 27% increase in closings to 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% or $35,000 increase in average selling price to $367,000. The 27% increase in closings was due to the strong orders we reported in recent quarters coupled with our previously discussed actions to put additional homes into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. As a result, our conversion rate for the quarter was 55%, which is up roughly 600 basis points over last year.","I'd like to point out that although our conversion rate improved on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, tight labor resources, elongated build cycles and development and permitting delays remain meaningful challenges across many markets. As such, we continue to target conversion rate improvement versus last year, but don't expect we will return to the rates of several years ago in the short term. As a result, we currently project a conversion rate of between 51% and 54% in the third quarter this year. This compares to the 48% conversion rate in Q3 of last year.","The 11% increase in average selling price for the quarter reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of our business towards move-up product. In addition to the shift in our mix, we also realized higher prices in each buyer group, including a 5% increase among first-time buyers to $270,000; an 11% increase in the price of move-up homes to $438,000; and a 4% increase in the average price of homes among our active adult buyers, $357,000.","During the quarter, closing percentages by buyer group were as follows: 29% first-time, 44% move-up and 27% active adult. In Q2 of last year, closings by buyer group were 34% first-time, 35% move-up and 31% active adult.","Given that our backlog ASP of $387,000 is up 13% over last year and up 5% for Q2 deliveries, we expect ASPs will continue to gradually move higher over the coming quarters.","Our second quarter gross margin of 21.5%, which includes approximately 70 basis points of drag associated with our first quarter acquisition of the Wieland assets, was in line with previous guidance. Adjusting for the impact of the Wieland closings, gross margins were down approximately 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of mix, higher land and labor costs. The company remains on track to deliver full year margins of approximately 21.5%, and we expect margins over the remaining two quarters to be in the range of 21.2% to 21.7%, which is down slightly from prior guidance of 21.5% to 22%. Based on our current backlog, we see higher labor and material costs continuing to put slight pressure on margins.","Offsetting some of the margin pressure, we continue to have success with our strategic pricing programs. In Q2, our total option revenues and lot premiums increased 5% over last year to approximately $67,000 per closing. In addition, sales discounts totaled 2.7%, which is up about 50 basis points from last year but consistent with our first quarter of this year's results.","Second quarter SG&A was $192 million or 11% of home sale revenues. Prior-year SG&A spend of $130 million or 10.5% of revenues included a $27 million benefit or approximately 210 basis points resulting from a legal settlement. Increased SG&A spend in the quarter reflects ongoing growth in support of the company's 26% increase in units under production, combined with costs associated with higher healthcare insurance and professional fees incurred in the period. Although the absolute dollar spend is higher than forecast, we still expect full-year SG&A will be approximately 10% of revenues, allowing PulteGroup to maintain its operating margins among the industry leaders.","At 10% of revenue, SG&A expenses are certainly within historical ranges, but as Richard discussed, we believe there are opportunities to drive greater overhead leverage. Based on our current targets, we expect to drive SG&A spend lower by at least 100 basis points in 2017 to 9% or lower of home sale revenues.","Continuing down the income statement, we reported other expenses net of $13 million. This includes approximately $7 million of deposits and other pre-acquisition charges associated with the termination of several pending land transactions, as well as the final $7 million of costs associated with the relocation of our corporate office.","Turning to financial services, we reported pre-tax income of $17 million, which is up from $10 million last year. These results benefited from the higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations, as well as the favorable interest rate environment given the decline in rates experienced during the quarter. Our mortgage capture rate for the period was 81%, down from 83% in the second quarter of 2015.","Consistent with company guidance, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%, yielding Q2 net income of $118 million or $0.34 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 348 million shares, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.","Moving past our income statement and looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 8,687 homes under construction at the end of the second quarter, of which 23% were spec. Consistent with our Q1 comments, after increasing spec home production in the back half of 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016 to help ensure a more consistent construction cadence, we have slowed spec starts somewhat as we build the backlog for the selling season. With an average of less than one finished spec per community, we remain in a very favorable inventory position.","In the second quarter, we approved approximately 5,800 lots for purchase and ended the period with 143,000 lots under control. Consistent with recent quarters, about 29% of our lot position is controlled through options as we work to manage our land risk and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 25% are developed.","During the quarter, we spent $379 million on land acquisition and generally remain on track with 2016 plans to invest approximately $1.6 billion, including the purchase of the Wieland assets in new land positions.","Consistent with Richard's comments and after several years of significant growth, we expect the rate of growth of our land acquisition spend to slow as we head into 2017. Recognizing that the current housing cycle is maturing, we are decreasing our land investment as a percentage of revenues, and could ultimately reduce the absolute dollars we spend depending upon our assessment of economic condition and their potential impact on the housing industry here in the U.S.","Looking at share repurchase activity during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $48 million or $18.51 per share. This brings our total repurchase activity for the first half of the year to $98 million.","Expanding on Richard's earlier comments about capital allocation, we've invested significantly in land-related development over the last few years, and we expect those investments to drive volume growth and strong cash flows for the next few years. We have also indicated that the growth in our investment is expected to moderate going forward. As a result, we feel we are well-positioned to increase the return of funds to shareholders, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities through the expanded share buyback program Richard outlined.","We expect to take on a certain amount of incremental debt in connection with the outlined share repurchase activities, but we expect to be able to maintain a responsible and certainly very manageable debt-to-cap level throughout this process. As a reminder, our target debt-to-cap range remains unchanged at 30% to 40%. While we may have leverage rates outside this range at points in time, we continue to believe our targeted range is appropriate and will strive to operate in that range over the long-term.","I'll just provide a couple more data points before turning over the call. Sign-ups for the second quarter were 5,697, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups increased an even greater 21% to $2.1 billion. Sign-ups by buyer group break down as follows. First-time increased 12%, move-up increased 21%, and active adult declined 3%. Adjusting for changes in community counts, absorption pace has increased 23% and 5% for first-time and active adult buyers respectively, but were lower by 8% among move-up buyers. As we talked about on our prior call, given the higher price points among Wieland communities, absorption paces are slower than traditional Pulte communities, which impacted the move-up buyer results.","During the second quarter, we operated from 700 communities, which is up 11% over last year. The 11% increase is in line with prior company guidance for year-over-year growth in community count of 8% to 10% in the first half of the year, expanding to 10% to 15% in the second half of 2016.","Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some comments on market conditions. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Thanks, Bob. While there has been a lot of volatility in the global economic and financial markets, U.S. housing continues to move along the slow recovery path it has been following for the past five years.","Government data as of May showing new home sales of 550,000 puts U.S. housing on track to deliver another year of roughly 10% growth. The trend is certainly positive. But after five years of recovery, we still remain well below the 50-year average, which is why we believe the recovery has a few years left. And while there is a lot of noise in the surrounding environment, there are certainly positives to be seen in the underlying economy, the job market, consumer confidence and the low mortgage rate conditions that are important drivers of ongoing demand.","The demand conditions we realized in Q2 are consistent with those suggested by some of the broader housing stats which point to a sustained recovery, but with pockets of stronger and weaker demand, depending on geography and buyer segment. On a regional basis, demand conditions in the quarter were as follows: consistent with comments made on many of our prior calls, demand on the East Coast generally gets stronger as you move from north to south. Florida, Georgia and parts of the Carolinas continue to experience solid buyer demand as we benefited from strong local economies.","Getting homes sold in some of our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, however, is a little more challenging as demand appears to be softer than at the start of the year. The middle third of the country covering our Midwest and Texas operations continue to experience strong demand conditions. All of our Midwest markets have been performing well, with notable gains in our Ohio and Kentucky operations as we continue to build on the Dominion positions we acquired in 2014.","Our Texas markets are generally performing well. Dallas continues to experience exceptional strength, although maintaining the needed pace of land development in the market is challenging. Houston is still showing great resilience as demand continues to exceed expectations. Excessive rains earlier in the year have us behind on land development for Houston and Austin, but our teams are working hard to catch up on some of the delays. And finally, looking out west, demand remains solid throughout the area with good traffic and sign-up paces in Arizona, Nevada and California. Although it is among our smaller markets, Seattle has realized a nice jump in buyer demand as we get new communities open and new product on the ground.","Overall, we are certainly pleased with the selling season for PulteGroup, as we realized good absorption paces and built a sizable backlog of sold homes. Our Q2 backlog is the highest in almost a decade, which sets us up well for the remainder of 2016. Having a large backlog allows us to provide a consistent flow of production, which is helpful when it comes to working with the trade base that we expect, will be stretched for the foreseeable future.","In closing, I want to recognize the entire PulteGroup organization with special thanks to the sales and construction teams which are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on the market opportunities and managing the challenges that develop. Thanks to your efforts, we have tremendous momentum heading into the second half of the year.","Let me now turn the call back to Richard for a few final comments. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Ryan. Before we open the call to questions, I want to take just a couple of minutes to comment on the other press release we issued this morning regarding the addition of three very talented executives to serve as independent directors on PulteGroup's board. For those of you who have followed homebuilding over the years, you will likely know the name John Peshkin. John spent much of his 30-year homebuilding career with Taylor Woodrow, including serving as the company's CEO for six years.","John has also served on the boards of Standard Pacific and WCI Communities. I am also pleased to welcome Josh Gotbaum to the PulteGroup board. After spending more than a decade in investment banking at Lazard, Josh held senior level positions in the U.S. government and has recently served as Acting Chief Operating Officer of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Josh's extensive Wall Street and government experience will be a great add to the collective experiences of our board.","Also joining our board will be Scott Powers, a financial services executive with over 30 years of experience. Scott, who was most recently President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors, has a long track record of success with some of the industry's premier asset managers including Old Mutual, Mellon Financial and Boston Company.","We look forward to having the experiences of three such proven executives added to our board. I would also note that in addition to joining the board, John and Josh have both been added to the search committee which was recently established to identify PulteGroup's next CEO. The committee's work is well underway as they evaluate internal and external candidates. John and Josh will go to work immediately to get actively engaged in the process.","And finally, I want to confirm that over the past several weeks, we have had conversations about broad business strategies and practices with Elliott Management, one of the company's shareholders. We certainly appreciate their perspectives about PulteGroup and ideas for creating long-term value for shareholders.","I would also tell you that from our very first conversation, we were in agreement with many of their thoughts because we had already been evaluating these same opportunities to enhance the business and potential returns for our shareholders. As an example, PulteGroup's efforts to supplement its board with direct homebuilding and additional Wall Street experience were already underway. The final candidate selection was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott. In short, all our discussions with Elliott were constructive and productive.","Beyond just speaking with Elliott, we've had extensive conversations with many other large shareholders over the past several weeks and months. The feedback has been very consistent in terms of investor support for our Value Creation strategy and the tactics we have been implementing. We view the planned actions we announced today on capital allocation, land spend, SG&A and corporate governance as appropriate next steps in our Value Creation work as we work hard to drive even greater shareholder value from here.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Great. Thank you, Richard. We'll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Scott, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Good morning, Jack.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jack.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, busy morning today. I guess the first question, Richard, on the land spend versus the buyback, 143,000 lots. Should we think about your lot inventory declining? Should we think about the pipeline of land moving under the eight-year number as you redeploy that cash into buybacks?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Jack, we definitely discussed before we would like to get the total land number lower for sure. We have been over the last five years buying much shorter positions, but as we moderate the rate of growth in our land spend, we will have quite a bit of free cash flow. And we intend just as we outlined as part of our Value Creation strategy that any dollars not going into land will be returned to shareholders. So that's why we're up on the buyback today.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then on the cadence I think you had said $250 million a quarter. Is that a pretty reliable number we can work with? In the model I'm sort of looking at the new earnings run rate and book value numbers.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","It is, Jack.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hi, guys. Good morning and a nice job in the quarter. Appreciate also the disclosures or the guidance on backlog conversion and some of the extra guidance there, so thank you for that.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","You bet.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","First question just on the expected cash flow from operations. I know you mentioned it sounds like you're not expected to cut the amount you're going to be spending on land, the rate of growth will slow. Is there any land sales contemplated over the next several quarters that's going to be a source of cash?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Alan, we have sold about $400 million worth of land over the last several years, and we're continually looking to prune unproductive assets. So that will continue, probably not in any great rate, not a big slug at any one time, but slowly over time you'll see that number continue to flow through a little bit.","But to be clear, with all the investment we put in over the past four years, which as you know has been in the 30% to 40% annual range in terms of increases year-over-year, we'll have substantial cash coming off the business just from that investment for at least the next few years. So as we begin to moderate the rate of growth, we're still going to have substantial growth over the next few years, but the rate of cash coming in vis-\u00e0-vis the incremental cash going out for land will free up quite a bit of capital for repurchases.","So to be clear, we're not intending on huge land sales to fund the buyback.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Understood. Thank you for that. And the second question. Just you made the comment that even with the slowing growth of land spend you still think there's several years of growth in the business. So I was hoping you might be able to frame that for us within the context of your comments about the cycle and where we are. It sounds like you used some different language this quarter just as far as maybe coming a little bit closer to the end of the cycle, or at least shifting the strategy a little bit. So, I think there's this view that the market is in a pretty steady growth phase, call it, 10% plus or minus and there's several large builders that expect that type of growth to continue for the next several years.","So, A, would you agree with that as far as the market is concerned? And, B, within the Pulte specific camp, how do you see you trending versus the market as you move out beyond 2017?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Alan, Richard here again. A couple things. So we do agree with that statement, this slow and steady path for the next several years overall. The fact is we've been stepping on the gas pretty hard the last few years with regard to land spend and we're just going to moderate that a bit which will free up quite a bit of cash from operations. But that's our view collectively on the market. The second pieces is we realize that we have a large land base that we need to monetize and we're going to work really hard to have that continue to drive business for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. A lot of stuff to digest today. Just wanted to start, Richard, when you're thinking about 2017 and maybe to Alan's question, is the right way to think about how you're planning for the business that 2017 is going to be the peak year for deliveries relative to the fact that land spend is going down? So deliveries like peak out in 2017 but you have a lower capital base and a more efficient balance sheet? Is that the strategy? Or am I missing something here?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Bob, I wouldn't necessarily say that 2017 will be the peak year for deliveries. The reality is, is that land that we put in place today it's 24 plus months before it comes on line. So when we began increasing investment back in 2013, we knew that 2016 would be a big year and we're expecting growth from here. So I can't comment on exactly when that growth peaks. And I'll point out that we're talking about only moderating the growth rate of land, not necessarily cutting the rate of land. So we're still projecting solid growth over the next several years and I want to be clear about that. So I wouldn't call for 2017 to be the peak. The reality is though we should be getting more and more efficient as we monetize this large land base we already have.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's an important distinction and a helpful one. Thanks for clarifying that. Can you walk me through, and maybe the ball goes to Bob's court. You're slowing the pace in land, it's partially calling the cycle, it's partially an effort to get better financial performance through the balance sheet. But what's the logic behind levering up to buy back stock given the fact that the stock's now trading at close to two times book and obviously that's a positive thing which shows the Value Creation plan has worked. So from my standpoint, I am trying to understand, if the cycle is further along than we'd anticipated, does it make sense to run to 40% to 50%? Why do you want to reinvest back on a systematic buyback program given the fact that the underlying land in your existing balance sheet's already appreciated, and the market recognizes the good work?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bob, it's worth remembering, if you go back to, call it, December of 2014, I think, when we had our Investor Day and laid out what our uses of capital were going to be, this is really the execution of that. So we highlighted we want to invest in high growth or high return opportunities, and when that, as we've talked about, has moderated not stopping to Richard's point, but moderating the growth of it \u2013 so we'll still be investing a fair amount of money \u2013 using that excess cash flow to return to shareholders. And the important thing and you've asked the question, is around that it hinges on debt-to-cap between 30% and 40%. Today, we're at 35%. We're talking about incremental leverage over that next 18 months that isn't really terribly significant. Again, we highlight that we might go a little bit above 40%, but not a lot.","And again, what we've indicated is that we would seek to get back down under 40% as time goes by because that's what we've outlined in terms of our priorities. So we've not tried to make a determination of market. So when we've been buying back equity over the last two or three years, we have a view about market values. But typically, we're buying on a relatively consistent basis with the cash we have available. And other than trading what we think is intelligently as the market price changes, we're not saying we think the stock is expensive or inexpensive; we're just returning shareholder funds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and also a lot to digest and I think a lot of good stuff. Just wanted to try and get a little bit more clarity as we think about 2017, and I know that it appears that you're not going to give too much in terms of guidance. But maybe just some rough ways to think about the upcoming year. I think a lot of people are trying to figure out \u2013 and I think you've given some talking points to it in terms of when you talk about slowing growth in land spend, what does that mean for closings growth next year? Certainly, you've reiterated your community count guidance for the back half of the year. How should we think about community count in 2017? And it would seem that you should still be able to do some amount of closings growth but maybe sub-10%. Is that fair?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Mike. This is Richard. I want to be crystal clear for everyone on the call. What we're doing today will not impact our 2017 volumes. When we buy land in this space, it's for at least 24 months out. No one should model or change their view on what our growth should be relative to 2017 here at all. That's why we commented extensively in our release that we will be growing for the next several years.","And I also want to point out, we're talking about moderating the rate of growth in our land spend, and we've been growing substantially. So there's lots of growth to come. The reality is we have a large balance sheet, and we're just going to monetize that to a better degree, I believe, than we have in the past and use the cash flow to help buy back equity.","And to a comment that was asked on the previous question, no one's talking about leverage anywhere near 50% here. Bob stated very clearly we want to stay within that 30% to 40% range. And if we get outside of it, we'll work hard to bring it back in. So just wanted to clarify there.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, I appreciate that. And I guess, again, how it affects your 2017 notwithstanding, which you're saying it won't, I think if there's any ability to give any sense of how you're thinking about closing volume growth for next year that would be helpful. And also kind of moving on to the second question, again incremental clarity. I just ran some very quick numbers on some more share buyback and a little more leverage, and \u2013 or a little more debt, and it does appear that you'd at worst be in a perhaps a 40% to 45% range, and again that would be for a brief amount of time. Is that the right way to think about that, Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I'll address both. Typically, to your first question on 2017, we would give color on 2017 later this year, and we would expect to do that, not today. In terms of the leverage rates, like anything else in life, it depends on when we go to market; how the business cash flows are generated over time. But again, I would tell you that our expectation is at the end of 2017, with the buyback levels that we're talking about, we don't think we get much outside of 40%, to Richard's earlier comment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo","Thank you. Just, Richard, you talked early on about overhead leverage, generating that. Could you talk about what specific actions you all have in plan and how we should expect this to trend as we go through the next 18 months?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, that is still underway internally. So I don't want to get too detailed here. But we are looking at reducing overhead costs throughout the operation collectively. And I would expect that the actions we take there will be taken in third quarter and that our newly established run rate will be in place for Q4. So we'll have more to say on our Q3 call clearly about the detail there. But we expect to reduce our overhead costs in Q3.","Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then I'm just going to jam in two questions here, if I could. One, some of the organic metrics, excluding Wieland what the orders were, what the community count was. And then do you have any type of timing on the CEO search?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","I'll answer the first, and then maybe Bob or Ryan could comment on the business excluding Wieland.","I'm not involved in the search, Stephen, but I do know the committee is underway. They've engaged an outside firm and they intend to get the two new directors up to speed immediately. And I know there's plans to do that like literally immediately. So I can't speak for the committee, but I would hope that over the next couple of months they would be able to wrap up their work. So not specificity there, but sometime in the not too distant future, I would think. And on the other comment -","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Stephen, on Wieland, we're not going to give detail on Wieland versus the rest of the business. What I'll offer is our absorption pace, as we highlighted, were up 23% in first-time, down 8% in move-up, up 5% in active adult. Again, Wieland sits in that move-up space and absent the Wieland business that would have been flat year-over-year. So in total, our absorption paces were flat Q2 versus Q2 last year. They would have been up somewhat instead if we hadn't had the Wieland business. And we did highlight 70 basis points of margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. Curious as you look at the business now from a segment standpoint where the demand is or for land costs, or where land costs are or where selling prices are? And what you're seeing in the business that has you evaluating where we are in the cycle is what I'm trying to figure out?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Eric, I think it's fair to say we feel like we're somewhere in the middle of the cycle. We're not in the early stages of the cycle. It is maturing and land costs are up. I'll echo something that Bob put in his script. We're proud of our operating margin performance and we are taking some SG&A action to help keep that. As land prices and labor prices are not allowing quite as much pricing power as we've had in the past on account of the gross margin side. So it's a very healthy housing market, we're really pleased with our absorption paces and we project the next few years are going to bring more of the same.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Just to follow up. That's helpful. I can understand the land and labor influence on the cost side of the gross margin equation. I guess on the selling price side of that, where within the markets are there segments of the market where, or segments of demand where it's harder to raise price to earn a really attractive gross margin that makes you feel a little bit different about volume?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Eric, this is Ryan. What I would tell you is that the first few weeks of July have continued to show typical seasonal selling patterns, and we continue to see local economies drive pockets of strength and\/or weakness as we move across the country. One great example that I'll give you is our Dallas market. That's a market where the local economy continues to do very well and we're seeing nice pricing power throughout all of the segments. And the other thing that I would just point out to you, Eric, is we continue to say through our Value Creation strategy there are focuses on driving high returns. Margins are certainly a component of driving high returns but it's not the only thing that we focus on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi, Will.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I guess in terms of \u2013 you gave some regional color on Florida and the Northeast, which I found interesting, because markets like the Mid-Atlantic for resale were quite strong. Can you talk about where you saw the pockets of softness in the Northeast, as well as the pockets of strength in Florida?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Yeah, Will. Where we've seen pockets of relative weakness over prior year were in the Northeast market specifically, New Jersey, and our Boston area markets. We saw nice strength in D.C. and throughout Florida was very strong.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for that. And then I hate to beat a dead horse, but in terms of reduced land spend, should we anticipate that's mainly targeted at, I'll call it, non-Pulte Homes brands, specifically probably more like Centex? And I guess, as a side note, in terms of cash flows, does this mean that you're not necessarily pursuing an investment-grade rating over the next, I'll call it, year and a half?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Will, this is Richard. We're not giving color on where exactly our moderation in land spend will affect it. As Bob indicated, as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll provide additional color going forward, but I want to be clear, that won't be affecting the next couple of years' worth of volume. And then with regard to investment grade, I'll just make one opening comment and then turn it to Bob. We are intending to maintain our investment discipline and our debt to capital discipline, which we've outlined five years ago as part of Value Creation was our target range. So with that, Bob, do you want to talk about the rating?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would just make two comments. One, on the capital. To your question, I don't think it would change our perspective. Our land teams have \u2013 we are agnostic to what land they're buying, so we're not going to say \u2013 we're not going to spend as much and we particularly don't want you to buy entry-level or something like that. So the teams have the capacity to make the investment decisions.","And then with respect to the agencies, and I think Richard said it all, we will maintain the discipline we have. We think we've got a business that is supportive of an investment grade whether they get there or not. This will introduce some more leverage but certainly within the guidelines that we outlined. And if not, we'd seek to get back inside.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","In regards to the gross margin for the back half, I wonder if you could explore that a little bit. I see the order pace is going along with how we would expect, but I wonder, because you've had this really strong growth in closings, especially in the first half in general. What was the factor or region that is causing that modest trim down, realizing you're obviously taking cost actions on the G&A side to offset that structurally. But could you go into that a little bit? Is it labor? Is it the land? Is it the pricing wasn't as strong and within regions? Thank you.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ken, I think the answer is all of the above to some extent. Certainly, Wieland is impacting our margins consistent with the way we thought they would. Mix matters. If you look at our second quarter of this year versus second quarter of last year, Del Webb, or active adult I should say, is less of a contributor and it is our highest margin business so that on a mix adjusted basis takes our margins down.","And to be clear and we've said this over time, land prices have gone up over time and that more expensive land cycles into our mix. Labor costs are up. We have a generally positive or favorable commodity market, so the input costs there, but labor is expensive. We've suggested or we've guided that 1.5% to 2% growth in our house cost, and again, a lot of that is labor. So all those things factor in as we look at what we've had occur in this quarter and what's going to happen over the next couple of quarters.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","And Ken, this is Richard. I'll just add one thing. We are committed to operating margin excellence regardless of what gross margins are doing, and we're pleased with where our gross margins are. They're still on a relative basis quite strong, but we just want to be clear that we want to maintain our lead in operating margins.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","No, I understand that. And obviously, you're taking the SG&A actions. In regards to your comments, since you're not talking about 2017 in terms of operational metrics, like closings or community count, and your land actions this year are not impacting 2017, could you talk about the volume assumptions? How are you getting to that 9%? Is it just on cost reductions, efficiency, or how much leverage is occurring due to variables you're not commenting on, I guess? How would you describe that? Thank you very much.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","It's a bit of both. We are counting on revenue growth and volume growth, and we're counting on dollars, actual dollars, coming out of the business as well. We're not providing any more color than that at this stage. As Bob indicated, we'll have more to say a little bit later in the year, but we're pleased with the fact that we'll be getting incremental leverage on the business next year.","And the other thing I'll just say about it is our 2017 volumes will be driven by what we invested in 2014, 2015 timeframe primarily. So that's why we know we'll have growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Not to beat a dead horse here, but the 9% SG&A target, I just want to be clear that you guys think that you can achieve that kind of leverage on volume and also some structural cost reductions and it's not really coming at the expense of community count growth, is that correct?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","That's 100% correct, yes.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then if I missed this, I apologize. But in the press release, you talked about a $0.03 charge from pending land transactions and also a corporate relocation. Maybe if you can give a little bit more detail on that, particularly on the corporate relocation, which I thought would've been well behind us at this point.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As we highlighted, that's actually what we think of the final costs associated with that and really we vacated the last space we had in Michigan. So it just was dependent on when we actually got folks consolidated in one spot. So we think that one is completely behind us now.","As it relates to the pending land transactions, essentially, it's one fairly significant and complex transaction that we've been working on for a number of years, the entitlements were challenging, and as we move forward because of some of the cost elements of it candidly, the deal just didn't make a lot of sense. And rather than push it forward because we had a lot of money invested in it, we decided to walk away rather than make it a long-term problem for us. So kind of a unique circumstance in that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Susan.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi, Susan.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","In the last call, you guys went through and you gave some really good information around your impaired land and how to think about the margin impact as those lots come back. And as we're one quarter further and we hear about this newer land strategy or this updated land strategy that's coming together. Is there any change in the thought around those impaired assets and perhaps the timing or the pace at which they may come and you start closing more homes on them?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Susan, just want to be clear, we haven't changed our strategy with respect to land. All we've said is we're not going to grow our investment in land at the 30%-plus rate that we have for the last three or four years. Our strategies remain the same. In terms of our ability to monetize those assets, you heard Richard say we've sold probably $400-ish million over the last four or five years of non-core assets. And so we will continue to seek to do that. Those will be kind of lumpy as things become marketable if they're out there, and there aren't a ton of them, candidly. We've got, as an example, less than $100 million on the balance sheet today of land held for sale which is stuff that we would think would transact in the relatively short-term.","And obviously with respect to some of our other longer-dated positions, we've talked about those pretty consistently over time where we're just seeking to drive the best return we can off of forward investment, and so as demand is there we will sell those.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of Texas, I know that you noted in your comments that you are a bit behind on the operations there just because of the rain that was experienced earlier in the year, but you had some good closings and you had some order growth there, actually. Can you just give us a bit more color on that?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Yeah, Susan, this is Ryan. We're very pleased with what's happening out of our Texas operations including the demand. Certainly, the weather has been a factor. I'll tell you that the weather's probably most greatly impacted our ability to develop land. As the dirt has just become so saturated, we have to wait for it to dry out. We don't anticipate it having a significant effect on our operations and ability to deliver future closings out of our Texas markets.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","And, Susan, the conversion improvement that we had in the quarter, which Bob noted we expect continued improvement vis-\u00e0-vis last year, that's a result of the better pace of inventory management that we put in place over the past six to nine months, and I think Ryan detailed that quite a bit on the last call, and we're pleased. We've got more inventory in the ground that is helping.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to ask one more question about just framing the margin environment. And on the 9% SG&A, how much of getting from 10% to 9% in fiscal 2016 to 2017, how much of that is incremental to your prior, what you would've planned prior to this? And should we think of this as you talked about some of the gross margin pressures, you're obviously focused on holding operating margin, so is it fair to characterize that as we look ahead, your current gross margin basis is roughly that 50 to 100 basis points lower that you're now looking to offset on the SG&A side?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike, we're not giving guidance beyond what we have in terms of margin. I think what we're trying to communicate on the expense side is, we're looking to maintain the efficiency of our operations. We think we have an opportunity to run the business with a little bit less cost. And so I don't think there's any correlation necessarily between the margin conversation and the expense conversation. The margins will be what they are depending on market conditions and our ability to control costs. We are going to try and drive better efficiency in our operations to reduce expenses.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then secondly, just since there's the new buyback out there and the bulk of it is coming at a point when there's a leadership transition. And so if we think about the search that's going on and the candidates being evaluated, is the board committed to finding someone who is entirely aligned with this current strategy or is there a chance that someone will come in and we'll see another shift in strategy next year? Just any comments around if there's a tie between the two right now.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Mike, this is Richard. The board is very aligned, as the leadership team is, around this Value Creation strategy. I wouldn't want to comment specifically on what the next CEO would do. But I can tell you that our board members who have spoken with investors have been very clear that they are committed to value creation. So that certainly will influence the next CEO's thinking around this. And it's been successful strategy for the company, so we're pleased with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups. It sounds as if you're sort of reevaluating where we are in the cycle and shifting your strategy a little bit. I'm curious if that has changed any of the specifics around your land-buying strategy. At this stage in the cycle, do you place more emphasis on some of your risk factors in your model than others? Does your view on growth in the different segments of the market change how, not necessarily the amount of land that you're spending, but how you might spend that land, or do those risk factors and priorities stay the same no matter where we are in the cycle?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Megan, this is Richard. I think I can help with that. We view everything we're announcing today as a continuation and perhaps an enhancement of what we've already been doing, which is shortening the overall length of positions that we're taking on the land side. We gave some good disclosure before that the last several years we've been buying much shorter positions. So that continues.","What we are also saying is that with 143,000 lots, we have a lot of dry powder to monetize from here and that we don't need to grow our rate of land spend at 30% or 40% a year, as Bob indicated, going forward. But the care with which we underwrite deals, the focus on closer-to-the-city properties, the discipline to stay away from those tertiary B and C locations, the idea to not take on 10 years', 15 years' worth of land risk on any one deal, that all stays the same going forward. And to be clear, we do think the market's got several years of growth ahead of it. We're just trying to be prudent with regard to recognizing the large land book that we have.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just there had been some concern in recent weeks about perhaps the market slowing at the tail end of the quarter. Can you talk a little about cadence throughout the second quarter?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Megan \u2013 or this is Ryan. What I would tell you is that the first few weeks of July have proven to be very similar to previous seasonal patterns that we've seen in prior years, and it's very normal. The cadence has proven out to be very normal seasonal type patterns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I want to maybe follow up on Megan's question just in a slightly different way, going back to that recognition that the cycle is maturing and that maybe you're dialing back the land investments. You still have a fairly broad range of product categories. Does it change how you think about the mix of the brands you have? Does it make you think that would it make more sense to be a more streamlined builder around the move-up categories, or do you want to continue to have a line in the water on all the different price segments right now?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, PulteGroup, Inc.","Buck, this is Richard. That'll continue to be driven by what our local operators are seeing with regard to demand in their business, and that's candidly fluid all the time. So as an example, if you operate in Southwest Florida, we're doing a lot of active adult business because that's the business there, whereas in Texas, the entry-level's quite strong. So our local operations and what they're seeing will continue to let that land seek its natural place of highest return. So we're not trying to make a macro call on the segment.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just quickly as a follow-up, the 23% increase in first-time buyer absorption, or those communities for first-time buyers, how much of that is a function of the shift of putting more spec into production? Did that disproportionately affect those types of communities, or is it more of a true market shift in demand? Can you help us add some context to that number?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Buck, this is Ryan. What we're seeing is it's a true shift in demand in the marketplace, doesn't really have anything to do with our spec strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weintraub \u2013 Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. On the Wieland acquisition, I think you mentioned, it had about a 70-basis-point impact in the quarter. Is that a similar amount is expected in the current quarter and when might you see that unwinding, do you think?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We had said that it would be 70-ish basis points this year as we work through the acquired inventory. So I think you'll see it for the balance of this year but not into next year.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then in terms of any financing that you might do for the repurchase program, et cetera, are you leaning to short term or would you be potentially going some more longer term debt, or how should we think about that?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think market conditions will help us to make that decision over time. This business, I think, is best served by longer-term capital markets activity as opposed to short term or something of this nature. I think that's still consistent. We'll look at the markets as we get to a point where we're going to issue debt. They're attractive today, so that would be a at-market-time decision.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And just lastly, doing quick back-of-the-envelope math, it seems to me that the majority of the share repurchase program would be financed by free cash flow. You did mention there would be some debt financing. But if you're going to stay in the 40%, maybe a little bit above that, it seems that the majority would be from free cash flow. Is that a fair conclusion?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we have indicated where we think leverage goes. And again, it can \u2013 within the six-quarter period when we borrow matters; when we earn money matters. And so you'll see some volatility or variability \u2013 better choice of words. But we don't see it getting as much outside of our targeted leverage rate by the time all is said and done.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn to show over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. You may begin your conference, sir.","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Sarah. This is Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations for Pulte Homes. And I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning to hear PulteGroup's earnings third quarter financial results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013.

I take some satisfaction in knowing that we will make many of the same claims [ph] today that we have been making for much of the past 2 years.","First, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter earnings results, both the absolute numbers and the demonstrated progress we continue to make operating against our value creation strategy. Once again, our quarterly financials show the benefits of initiatives targeted at driving higher returns on invested capital through increased margins, better overhead leverage and accelerated inventory turns. Our Q3 financials show improvement in each of these metrics. On a year-over-year basis, our adjusted gross margin in the quarter increased by 390 basis points to 25.5%. This makes the 11th quarter in a row of margin expansion.","In addition to better gross margin, we captured an incremental 90 basis points of overhead leverage. If our income statement showed our traditional operating margin, it would've expanded by almost 500 basis points over last year as a result of the combined improvements in gross margin and overhead leverage. And, although less dramatic in its gain, inventory turns continued to make steady progress and is now approaching 1x for the trailing 12 months. The number can be better appreciated when you put into context of turns being around 0.6x when we started this work just 2 years ago. The significant improvements we realized in our homebuilding operations for the quarter drove a 65% or $69 million increase in our consolidated income before taxes. And this is after having to overcome a $16 million decrease in pretax income from financial services caused by changes in the competitive landscape for mortgage originations resulting from higher interest rates.","I purposely highlighted our pretax income to avoid any distortions created by the DTA reversal taken in the quarter. While the benefits of the DTA are many, I wanted to make sure that the gains our operating teams are delivering were clearly visible. The dramatic progress in PulteGroup's income statement metrics are equally matched by the improvements we have realized on our balance sheet. With this quarter's DTA reversal, our reported debt-to-cap dropped to 31% on a gross basis and 12% on a net basis adjusted for cash, which is less than half of what these ratios showed just 3 years ago. The much-improved strength of PulteGroup's balance sheet is allowing us to implement our stated plans to be more balanced in our allocation of capital. As noted in this morning's earnings release, through the first 9 months of the year, we have invested $918 million in land and development, retired $461 million of debt, repurchased $83 million of stock and declared $38 million in dividends. Our improved financial position and operating performance are also allowing us to systematically increase investment into the business with our announced plans to authorize $1.6 billion of land development and acquisition spend in 2014, up almost 70% from our full year spend in 2012.","With $1.4 billion of cash and leverage down to 31%, we clearly have the capacity to invest much more into the business, but we have committed to being disciplined in our approach and will not chase volume. Land prices have gotten extended in some markets, and we are willing to be patient and focus on investing only in the smartest deals when putting incremental capital to work.","To that last point, let me close out my remarks with a few comments about the overall operating environment we find ourselves in today. I expect it will come as no surprise when we say that conditions in the housing industry changed during the past few months as some consumers shows to step back from the market. Is this recent change among potential buyers the result of higher selling prices or higher mortgage rates or the relentless commentary of political turmoil and economic uncertainty? We would say yes. It is likely that all these changes have resulted in consumers taking longer to make their purchase decision. We have been consistent in our position that housing's recovery off the lows of 2011 was driven more by the reduction in supply than a dramatic rally in demand. Buyer demand since 2011 has slowly but steadily improved, and we expect that the recent slowdown in demand will prove to be a modest pullback in an ongoing, multiyear recovery in housing. It is this expectation which gives us confidence in our decision to increase planned land investment in 2014.","We also remain in the camp that a return to a significantly stronger historical level of housing production will require an ongoing recovery in the broader U.S. economy that is slowly developing, a recovery that can produce more and higher-paying jobs. Achieving substantially higher volumes will also require more participation from first-time buyers. This buyer category has historically represented over 40% of housing buyer demand, but continued tight underwriting standards and weak personal balance sheets are holding entry-level buyer participation to below 30% of current activity. All that being said, we expect buyer activity will improve, and we are optimistic that the overall recovery in housing will continue. In fact, over the past few weeks, we have modestly adjusted incentives in a few select communities. This action has helped to generate stronger buyer interest in the back half of September and the first half of October than we had experienced in the weeks prior to these actions. While market conditions may be subject to change, what I can tell you that won't change is our commitment to the company's value-creation strategy and more effective capital allocation. I am pleased to say that PulteGroup's third quarter financial results continue to demonstrate the success this strategy and underlying initiatives are having on PulteGroup's profitability and returns.","Now let me turn over the call to Bob for a more in-depth glimpse on PulteGroup's third quarter financial results. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. As Richard outlined, our Q3 results demonstrate clear and meaningful progress against the number of the operating and financial goals we established with the company. I'm pleased to provide some additional details related to our performance this quarter and to highlight some of the important financial improvements we've achieved.","In the third quarter, home sale revenues increased 21% over the prior year to $1.5 billion. The increase in revenues for the period was driven by an 11% increase in average selling price to $310,000 and a 9% increase in closings to 4,817 homes. Consistent with trends we have seen for a number of quarters, the higher average selling prices in the quarter were driven by price increases and the continuing shift in our closings to move-up and active adult homes. For the third quarter, our closings break down as follows: 46% from Pulte, 30% from Del Webb and 24% from Centex. In the third quarter of last year, our closing mix was 42% from Pulte, 25% from Del Webb and 33% from Centex. The relative percentage of closings from our Centex brand continues to decrease as older Centex communities close out and our current land investment is more concentrated in the move-up space.","On average, we realized a $31,000 increase in our year-over-year selling price from home closings. In fact, we realized higher sales price among each of our brands, including increases of 7% in Pulte, 5% in Centex and 10% in Del Webb. As noted, the shift in mix also contributed to the increase in our overall average selling price.","Land sale revenues in the third quarter totaled $56 million and generated pretax income of $5.8 million. In the prior year, land sale revenues and related income were $23 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Consistent with our efforts to improve returns, we continue to look for opportunities to dispose of non-core land assets.","In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 25.5%, which represents a 390 basis point increase over the third quarter last year and a 160 basis point increase over Q2 of this year. Our gross margins continued to benefit from company-specific and industry-wide factors, including better pricing, an increase in the volume of home closings from our Pulte- and Del Webb-branded communities, our ongoing efforts to lower house construction costs and our strategic pricing initiatives.","Continuing the trend from recent quarters, we realized an increase in margin contributions associated with higher lot premiums and option revenues per closing compared to the prior year. I would also point out that incentives were 2% this quarter, which represents a 270 basis point decrease from Q3 of last year.","It's important to highlight that our actual gross margin, which includes the amortization of capitalized interest expense, was 20.9% in the quarter. This represents an increase of 390 basis points over Q3 last year and 210 basis points over Q2 of this year. In fact, it's the highest reported gross margin we've had since the second quarter of 2006 and reflects the significant improvements we've made to our operational performance and our financial position.","At the start of 2013, we began discussing the percentage of closings generated from commonly managed plans. This represent homes that have been under -- that have been constructed under the more efficient design, cost and build processes we're implementing throughout the company. During the third quarter, commonly managed plans accounted for 16% of our closings, which is up from 13% in the second quarter. On a unit basis, the number of closings from commonly managed plans increased to almost 800 homes as we continue to make steady progress in expanding the program.","I want to highlight that closings from commonly managed plans are generating improved margins and, importantly, higher paces than closings from comparable non-commonly managed plans. Over time, we expect to increase the percentage of closings from commonly managed plans to approximately 70% of our total closings.","Looking at overheads, our SG&A for the quarter was $139 million or 9.3% of home sale revenues. This compares to the overhead cost of $125 million, or 10.2% of revenues, in Q3 of last year. The company continued to realize leverage on its SG&A spend as overhead cost increased by only $13 million against a top line revenue increase of $259 million.","Turning to Financial Services. Our Q3 profit was $11 million, which is down $16 million from the prior year. The decrease relates primarily to the rapid increase in interest rates over the past several months, which, together with competition from lenders shifting their focus from refinanced business to new money originations, has served to compress margins. The increase in competition also contributed to a 310 basis point decrease in our capture rate to approximately 80%.","Total mortgage origination volumes for the quarter increased 2% to 3,126 loans. The increase reflects higher homebuilding closing volumes, partially offset by the decrease in capture rate.","Moving on to income taxes. Let me address the reversal of the valuation reserve related to our deferred tax assets. As we've indicated previously, we expected that we would likely reverse a significant percentage of the valuation reserve in the second half of this year. During the third quarter, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient income in future periods to realize the substantial majority of those deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reversed $2.1 billion in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance remaining after that reversal is approximately $230 million, a portion of which relates to the income we expect to earn in the fourth quarter and the balance of which relates to certain state loss carryforwards we may not be able to realize. Including this benefit, PulteGroup reported earnings of $5.87 per share in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the reversal of the valuation reserve, the company would have earned $0.45 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the prior year.","Our basic and diluted share counts are as follows: For the quarter, basic shares, 383 million; diluted, 386 million. For the year, basic was 384 million, and diluted was 388 million. These share counts include the impact of our share repurchase activities. It's worth noting that when we calculate diluted earnings per share, we are required to adjust the numerator in the calculation by allocating a portion of the earnings to unvested restricted stock and performance shares. Typically, this is a small adjustment, but was more impactful this quarter due to the significance of our earnings of the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance.","For the quarter, this earnings allocation adjusted -- reduced our diluted EPS by $0.04 per share. In future quarters, we expect the impact of these earnings allocation adjustments to be immaterial. It's clear that we're continuing to realize significant progress in improving the key metrics we're focused on within our homebuilding operation. The company's better margin, improved operating leverage and faster inventory turns are driving better financial performance. Along with performance -- along with improvements in our operating performance, we continue to improve the strength and flexibility of our financial profile. Let me provide highlights relating to our cash flows and balance sheet.","During the quarter, we generated $220 million of cash flow from operations and reported $1.4 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. I want to highlight that our cash position increased $140 million from June, despite the fact that we repurchased $83 million of stock, paid down $27 million of debt and paid $19 million of dividends during the quarter. In total, we acquired 5.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $15.79 per share, and we have $259 million [ph] of capacity remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. I would also point out that we recorded a loss of $3.9 million during the quarter in connection with our debt repurchase.","We've spoken, over the last couple of years, about our desire to improve our leverage ratios. I'm pleased to report that our improved operating results, coupled with the significant equity impact related to the reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance, has allowed the company to achieve -- and in certain instances, exceed -- the objectives we set with regards to restructuring our balance sheet. In fact, at the end of the quarter, as Richard mentioned, our actual debt-to-cap ratio was only 31%.","Looking at other balance sheet metrics, we finished the quarter with 269 finished specs. This is flat with the prior quarter but represents a decrease of 52% compared with the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with just over 900 specs in production, which is comparable to the prior quarter but down 37% from last year. As we've discussed at different times, we are likely reaching the lower limit in reducing our spec production, but we remain committed to minimizing specs going forward. At the end of Q3, we had 6,312 homes under construction, so the spec count remains well contained at 15% of production. We're very comfortable maintaining a low spec count, as we typically see better pricing and higher margins on dirt sales. This is especially true when it comes to moving finished spec units, which can require a higher level of incentives.","On the land side, we put 9,050 lots under control during the quarter and invested a total of $380 million in land acquisition and development. This is up from $332 million in the second quarter of this year and puts us on a run rate toward the $1.4 billion of land investment we are forecasting for 2013.","We ended the quarter with just over 126,000 lots under control, of which, 23% are under option. This compares to the 13% of our lots being optioned one year ago. I'm pleased to say we've realized some success in optioning lots, although it's getting more challenging. At present, about 1\/4 of our lots are finished. As noted in our release, we have increased our authorized investment of land acquisition and development in 2014 to $1.6 billion, which is up $200 million over the $1.4 billion we're forecasting to spend this year. It's worth noting that most of the land deals we've accrued lately are raw and require development. And many of the option deals require entitlement of work before a purchase is completed. As a result, our land investment at this stage will impact our activities in 2015 and beyond.","In summary, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made improving our financial position. As you know, we've also talked about wanting to be more balanced with our capital allocation. It's rewarding to see much of that hard work and planning come to life in the third quarter. We increased our investment authorization for land, and we returned over $100 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase programs. We believe these uses of capital are appropriate, given our goal of consistent, strong returns for our shareholders. Before handing the call back to Richard, let me cover a few more data points. In the third quarter, net new orders totaled 3,781 homes, which is a decrease of 17% from last year. Given the price increases we have realized, the dollar value of sign-ups was $1.2 billion, which is down only 8% from the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, sign-ups decreased 25% at Pulte and 26% at Centex but were up 9% at Del Webb. Absorption paces were down 13% at Pulte, flat at Centex and up 10% at Del Webb. The slowdown in our Pulte brand is not surprising, given the price appreciation we've realized over the past 12 months. And the relative strength at Del Webb is encouraging. Sign-ups for the period were impacted by a 15% decrease in community count, as well as the slowdown in overall buyer demand experience by the industry over the past several months.","The lower community count for the period is consistent with our previous guidance that our 2013 year-end community count would be down approximately 15% from the end of 2012. While we don't view community count as a great measure of future activity, given the tremendous variation that can exist in the size, pace and profitability from community to community, we appreciate investor interest in this metric. As such, we wanted to provide a view as to what we expect in 2014.","We have previously indicated that our community counts decline in the past couple of years would bottom in 2014, and our latest forecast reaffirms this guidance as our increased land investment is working its way through the pipeline. Based on our current estimates, we expect to operate from an approximate range of 560 to 580 communities during all 4 quarters of 2014. This includes the opening of approximately 175 exciting new communities next year. Of course, the pace at which existing communities close out or delays in opening new neighborhoods could impact that range. And finally, we ended the quarter with 7,522 homes in backlog, valued at $2.4 billion. Backlog dollars are up 8%, while units are down 2% from the prior year. Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. Before we open the call for questions, I'll provide some color on the market conditions we experienced during the third quarter; but recognize, it's within the context of changes in industry-wide demand that we worked through during the period. By geography, I offer the following views: Generally, buyer demand held up reasonably well on the East Coast, with more strength in the Northeast, the Carolinas, Georgia and South Florida. Washington, D.C., was a little slower, as was North Florida. But I will tell you that those 2 areas are where we have been very focused on maximizing our pricing opportunities. The D.C. area was also likely impacted by the uncertainties leading into the government shutdown. Overall, we are very pleased with our business performance in the East.","On a relative basis, demand in our Midwest markets held up, although paces were lower than earlier in the year. Our Texas markets displayed similar patterns, with modestly slower demand reflecting a combination of consumer pullback, seasonality and fewer communities. Texas also has a higher percentage of Centex buyers relative to the rest of our markets, so higher mortgage rates can have a bigger impact within this buyer category. While generally limited supplies remain the norm out west, we have seen buyers step back to reassess, given the rapid price appreciation which has been common over the past year. That said, overall activity is still very reasonable. Demand has held up better in the Southwest, while California and the Pacific Northwest were a little softer. Again, markets with higher prices that have been realized -- that have realized above-average pricing for several quarters tended to see a bigger impact from buyer uncertainty, which makes sense. In conclusion, we would tell you that the housing market continues to recover, but just like the stock market, it never moves in a straight line. For all the reasons we touched on earlier, buyers took a step back during the quarter. But as I mentioned a moment ago, small and appropriate increased incentives in a few select communities since mid-September are already helping to stabilize recent sales activity. Since we can't influence national demand or the broader U.S. economy, we are focused on continuously improving our fundamental homebuilding operations, with the goal of delivering better returns over the housing cycle. I believe our Q3 results demonstrate further progress in our efforts and show that we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of opportunity that can develop in any market condition.","I want to thank the employees of PulteGroup, who continue to do an outstanding job in improving our results while never losing focus on delivering a great buying experience to our consumers. Again, thank you for your time. And I'll now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Sarah, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If we can talk about margins first. You've got a lot of interesting stuff going on, and you're one of the few builders that sort of can control their destiny a little bit in the current market. And that -- a lot of that's through your commonly managed floor plans. So what I'm -- I guess what I would like to understand is, you're 16% into it. You want to take it to about 70%. How long do you think it takes you to get there? And what type of differential -- you talked about both margin and pace. What type of differential to you see in those floor plans versus the non-commonly managed? And along with that, then, you've been pretty aggressive on pricing. How much of that is price versus mix? And how does that change as you move forward?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Steve, this is Richard. A couple of things. To give you a perspective on the timing, in the Texas zone, which we're furthest along, we could be upwards of 80% or 90% through there by the end of '14. But our Northeast zone, which is our last one, just got started a month or 2 ago. So probably a 2- to 3-year timeframe for us to get to that 70% number commonly managed. We're going as quickly as we can, but it takes a while to kind of reposition the plans. In terms of the differential, we do see better margins on those products. Depending on the plan, it can be a couple of hundred basis points. But I will also tell you that some of the benefits we're trying to get as early as we can, through value engineering, should cost-ing some of the work that we started a couple of years ago. And then probably one of the things we've been most pleased with in the process is that we're getting better, sales pace from the product. The product is actually consumer validated, and it's, frankly, better floor plans. A good example would be our active adult Del Webb floor plans, where we are completely implemented in our Texas and Southeast zones. And now we're in the middle of converting all our Del Webb product in the Midwest, which we call our central zones, in that product. So we're excited about that. And I think the last part of your question was related to pricing. Yes. Pricing has certainly been a good thing for us this year. We continue to get price in some communities. Although, as indicated, in some, we've had to put a few select incentives in places. Regarding pricing on the commonly managed plans, overall, we've been real pleased with the results we've had there.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you do look at that incentives, I'm interested in -- I assume that's pushed a bit more toward your Centex brand. But what type of incentives are you doing? What's it associated with? Are you seeing buyers take incentives associated with mortgage financing, whether a rate buydown or a closing cost, et cetera?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. It's mostly with regard to option packages that we've been offering. And it's a very limited number of communities. And frankly, not, we don't believe, significantly material to our overall margin results overall. We've been pleased, and we've been very targeted.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Randow of Citi.","William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of community count, often, you guys speak of your communities are much larger in terms of scale and size. How should we think about the size of communities in 2014 as opposed to 2013?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Will, it's going to be a mix. As Bob indicated, we've got 175 new communities, approximately, we're going to open next year, and they are in all flavors and sizes. Generally, a little bit smaller with regard to sort of our legacy book, if you will. But we still have a large portion of Del Webb communities that have a long legacy book out in front of them. And as Bob indicated, we're seeing better results from the Del Webb category. So probably not materially different than this year, relative to the overall mix of communities and size, which is one of the reasons we continue to highlight that, that's not the best metric to drive our business.","William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as a follow-up, as you bring on those communities, given their vintage might be a bit newer, so to speak, how do you think about gross margins relative to your very strong number today going forward?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, when we buy, we focus on returns. So as we acquire land, we're somewhat agnostic to margin. We're thinking about what's the return capability. So some of those communities may have a -- I'll make up a number, a 20% margin but a 30% return. And similarly, you could have a transaction that has a 27% return with 25% margin. So yes, the mix will matter. Again, what we're really trying to work through is how to get the highest return out of each land asset, Will.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC","It's actually Alan on for Ivy. Bob, just on that last comment, then, on the return threshold for underwriting. So based on your comments earlier, that seems like a lot of the land that you're buying now or targeting now is more raw in nature and maybe is more geared for 2015 and beyond. Should we expect, then, that, given that return focus, that maybe the margins on those assets should kind of come in line with where you're at today as opposed to maybe more finished lots, if you were buying those, which could be lower margins?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, it's hard to answer that intelligently because the market moves. The price -- market has improved in the last 2 years. So the assets that we bought then, even if they were finished lot option deals that we didn't expect great margins on, and we're getting them -- so again, as we look at this, I would tell you we're finding transactions and approving transactions that meet our return requirement. Some of them are going to be higher margins than others. It really varies on how we're buying land.","Richard J. Dugas","Alan, this is Richard. I'll add one thing. We generally have seen higher margins on the deals that we've acquired over the last 2 or 3 years than from our legacy book. So we're pleased with what we've been able to find. I think it's partly a result of the fact that we've been what I would say is very selective with our land acquisition strategy. And then just lastly, it's not directly related to your question, though, we do see opportunity for margin improvement from here in the next few quarters that we have visibility into.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Great, that's helpful. And then the second question is, Richard, I was hoping you might just be able to expand a little bit on the comments you had in the press release regarding the fact that you see this slowdown as ultimately being short lived. And it sounds like you're encouraged by some of the trends you're seeing in response to the select incentives you're offering. But just curious if you can expand upon that a little bit, and what gives you that confidence that this is more of a short-term issue?","Richard J. Dugas","Listen, we believe that the economy is continuing to show slow and steady progress. We're not in the camp that it's going to get euphoric anytime soon. But we still have very limited supply of housing out there. That's a key driver. We still have, on a relative basis, low interest rates. In hindsight, I think the speed at which rates went up was as big a factor in the pause that we've seen as much as the actual rate increases themselves. And then, when you combine that with the fact that entitlements are taking longer in general, I think all builders are commenting on that, I don't see a huge influx of supply coming on the market anytime soon. So with slowly but steadily improving demand and supply being held in check, we're optimistic as we get into next year. I think the pause that we've kind of recently seen is not necessarily a bad thing over the long run. So we're in the camp that it's likely temporary.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, on sales trends. The commentary around some of the more recent turn, I guess, or some of the improvement in September-October was helpful. I was hoping to get a sense of how order trends progressed throughout the quarter and if -- we had another builder report yesterday that August was, in fact, the strongest month that they had in the third quarter, if that was something that you saw as well or might have seen that perhaps there might have been a more steady or even slowing cadence throughout the quarter if you felt the need to do some of the modest incentive changes to drive a little bit more sales in September-October. So I was wondering if that's the case for you guys and maybe if you could give any type of quantifiable granularity in terms of what type of improvement you actually saw in the last 4 to 6 weeks.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Mike, this is Richard. Our trends were generally stable through the quarter. We saw things modestly slow through the quarter, although, as noted, when we added a few, and I want to emphasize a few, very select community incentives kind of in the mid-September range, we did see that help our absorptions at the end of September and into October. When you kind of look at it overall, it was a reasonably flat performance over the quarter with kind of a slight trend down through the quarter until we got to the last couple of weeks of September. And I think it's reflective of pricing that was quite high in some communities, along with buyer concern over rates. And some of those things appear to begin to ebb as we got to the end of the quarter into early October. But I don't have any specifics in terms of numbers for you.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the second question, just on maybe a little bit more technical, but interest expense amortization was about flattish. It's been roughly flattish year-over-year as a percent of revenue for the last couple of quarters. How do you expect that to trend? I guess, maybe more a question for Bob. And would that be affected at all by the increase in land spend as a percent of revenue as you go forward? And I think, just if I could sneak another one in on this topic of -- more technical, but on the sales commissions, including in -- included in COGS, you guys are only 1 of 3 builders out of 15 that we follow that put that in that line item. And without it, if you had it in SG&A, I think it would not only make your gross margins more comparable, in a positive sense, to your competitors, but also allow the SG&A to be more comparable as well. So just any thoughts on making that adjustment? Another builder in the last few -- a year or 2 ago made that change, and we found it pretty helpful.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Okay. Mike, I will answer the second one first, if that's okay. We -- you had raised this, I think it was, a call or 2 ago, and we said we'd look at it. And we did, actually. And what we found was that, although you see some people doing that, there's inconsistency between internal and external commission. And so I don't know that you'd get -- even if we switched, it doesn't -- it would depend on how we switched. And you wouldn't get consistency throughout the space, anyway. So again, we'll always continue to look as to how we report versus our peers, but we're pretty comfortable with where we are. And then on cap interest, the good news is that because of the deleveraging that we've done, our cash interest expense is down about $15 million quarter-over-quarter and will continue to trend down as we've paid down our debt. As it relates to the amortization, it's really not a revenue-based concept. It's -- we have given some guidance coming into the year that cap interest expense would actually be up this year by about $60 million. That's based on closings, essentially. And so it's weighted towards the back half of the year. So if you look year-over-year, the amortization of interest expense was up $11 million in this quarter versus last year, which is about 20%. And you would expect to see, based on closings, higher interest expense next quarter to fill that bucket of the incremental $60 million that we talked about at the beginning of the year. Going forward, I think it is fair to say we will see a decline in interest expense amortization. We've got less capitalized interest to amortize, and we're capitalizing less as we go. So I think you'll see a benefit on the income statement related to interest next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask Bob. You guys got very aggressive at doing a strong job of managing the balance sheet. Gross debt's at 31%, and then net debt's down to almost 10%. You mentioned the large cash position of $1.3 billion. You have lower debt levels. So I just wanted to see, from a capital allocation standpoint, with that $1.3 billion, is that money going to be put mostly towards share repurchases, dividends or land investment now that the debt's basically gone?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Good question, and it is one we've spent time thinking about. We've indicated, and consistently, I think, that we think the best place to invest is in the business. We get the best return there and continue to believe that. But as Richard highlighted, we want to make sure that we're buying the best land assets that we can to drive the best returns over time that we can. And so our belief is that, if we try to invest too quickly, some of our managers would likely be forced to take the third or fourth option, which might be okay but not great. And we'd prefer to stay in stuff that we feel really comfortable with. As it relates to dividends and share repurchases, since we have a big cash position, we can make selection almost exclusive of what we think we're going to do on the land side. Obviously, we've lost some stock last quarter at about $15.79 a share and have obviously now got the dividend going. That's something that we would look at and talk about internally with the board, but mutually exclusive decisions.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Really helpful. Just wanted to touch -- you've made tremendous progress in a pretty short period in gross margin improvement. And you've also done a really good job of leveraging fixed cost and SG&A. On the SG&A side of the story, is there room for improvement, or are you guys kind of at the outer end? I think you're on track, probably, for like $575 million of SG&A. How do you want us to think about that going forward?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Bob, this is Richard. Listen, we think we've done a really nice job. The leverage is certainly going to somewhat volume dependent. We'll have to kind of see how the year unfolds next year. If you're asking do we plan gross SG&A levels to come down from here, I don't think that's very likely. On the other hand, we want to monitor SG&A. So I guess the way I'd think about it if I were you is we are extremely committed to an ROIC story that is driven by gross margins, SG&A leverage, inventory turn. So I'd look for us to pay attention to all 3 of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was interested in the comments that you had about the increased competition from outside lenders and the lower capture rate. Another builder that reported this week actually had, I think, amongst the lowest capture rate we've seen in 10 years or so. So can we interpret that or -- as a kind of increased, improved lending from outside sources and some better mortgage availability? Or, I guess, what are your comments on mortgage availability?","Richard J. Dugas","Our perspective is it hasn't changed much. And in particular, for the first-time buyer, it hasn't changed much. QM has codified what people can approve as a loan. Essentially, what we think is happening as it relates to competition is, as rates went up, the refinance business that the banks had been very aggressively pursuing dried up. You've seen some of the headlines about some of the downsizing of workforces at the big banks that were big mortgage originators. And so they've got machines that need to be fed, and so I think we're pursuing new money originations. And so we've had to compete with them in order to retain the business. And we like the business because we think it protects our backlog. So it's forced us to be -- try and be more competitive on rate.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question, just on Del Webb. I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the trends you're seeing there. And particularly, I was curious about the -- I think it was Slide 5, which had the price increases. I mean, should we interpret those that -- the Del Webb price increases being the largest amongst the 3, is that where you're seeing outsized improvement?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Adam, this is Richard. I would suggest a couple of things. Number one, the buyer has historically been a little bit later than the other buyer categories to sort of return to the market. So we're not surprised that Webb continues to, at this stage, begin to sort of come into its own. And we are seeing better results there. And, as you'll rightly note, we have quite a bit of leverage opportunity if it continues. The other piece I've mentioned to you is the commonly managed plans. We have chosen to begin our efforts with the Del Webb product, and we have had nothing short of fantastic results in both Texas and the Southeast, where we've introduced our new commonly managed active adult Del Webb product. I mentioned earlier, we're rolling that now to the Midwest, and we expect to have it in the Southwest at some point early in 2014. So as time goes on, we think we've got an excellent product offering to meet what's hopefully a growing demand category.","Operator","And your next question comes from Eli Hackel of Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about the land spend that you're going to do, maybe give us some idea in terms of the land you have ready for 2014? And you mentioned you're going more into raw land. Maybe from the additional dollars, the $1.6 billion you think you may spend next year, maybe where that's going to be mostly concentrated?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Eli, this is Richard. We are being really disciplined with our process, as we have been. So we're using our risk-weighted criteria. And frankly, that's leading to a pretty diverse implementation of land spend across the system. Places that we've underinvested in the past, we continue to invest in to help position ourselves. A good example is Minnesota. We've highlighted before, we've put quite a bit of money into Minnesota. Georgia, actually, is a market that has recently, the last 6 to 12 months, come on. We're putting a good bit of capital to work there with really good results. So it's not just one market, if you will, that's getting the lion's share of the investment. With regard to 2014, I think it's fair to say that we have limited to virtually no ability to impact '14 at this point with land. The dollars that we're putting to work now are for '15 and '16. So again, we're really pleased that our community count is going to be stable next year, all year, which shows that we're able to get some of the increased investment to work a little bit sooner than we have planned for. And we're happy because the investments that we're making, we believe, are very high-quality investments.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick one. I don't know if you said it or I missed it, but what was the cancellation rate in the quarter?","James L. Ossowski","The cancellation rate in the quarter was 18%.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is actually for Bob. I wanted to talk to you about the share repurchases in the quarter and this concept of intrinsic value and return on share repurchases relative to buying land and reinvesting in the business. And what I'm trying to get some color on is just how you got to 5.3 million shares, essentially? What was the math that kind of got you there that told you that, that's the right amount relative to more or less and relative to the overall balance sheet? I'm just trying to understand how you compare the 2 better.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, it's not as if we set out to say we want to buy x number of shares. And so it's not a programmed trade. Essentially, what we do is we look at the activity that we're seeing in the market, or we looked at the activity we were seeing at the market. Clearly, when we set the program in place, we talked about, internally, what levels we were comfortable buying at. And so over the course of the trading period, it just sort of happened that, that was the volume that we were able to acquire at prices that we were comfortable with.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And in terms of the return differential between the 2, when you, again, kind of get back to the intrinsic value, can you just get some more clarity on kind of how you think about one versus the other or how much more it has to be to reinvest in the shares versus in land specifically?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well -- and remember, they're separate conversations at this point because of our cash position. So it's not as if we're saying we are going to acquire stock in lieu of investing in land. We are investing in land, and that's a process that we go through, and we're buying back shares. And so it's not as if we're borrowing to do it that puts us in a position to make an either\/or choice.","Richard J. Dugas","And David, to maybe add a little more clarity, we believe that over a period of time, the balance that we're showing with regard to the priority being toward land investment when it makes sense in the smartest deals, and then other uses of capital returned to shareholders in addition to that, we believe, will drive the best ultimate long-term shareholder return. So just to reiterate to Bob's point, it's not an either\/or. It's a combination. And we worked ourselves into a position where we can be very flexible.","Operator","And your next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Good progress on the margins. I wanted to follow up on your comment about anticipating that future communities that you're going to be opening are going to be primarily looked at on a return-on-capital basis, which obviously -- which makes a lot of sense. But I just want to understand a little bit better in terms of how you think that might play out. So it would be my expectation, and I'm curious if you share it, that as you go forward into late 2014 and into 2015, that mortgage availability should broaden out a little bit. I certainly hope so. And if that's the case, you'll probably see a bit of mix shift where you'll see some more buyers who may be more towards the entry-level side come into the market. And I was curious, first, do you sort of agree that, that is the way things may play out over the next 18 months? And if so, do you think that, on balance, your communities would be more skewed towards a little bit of a higher-turn, lower-margin-type business model? And then the second thing is, do you have -- do you feel like you've got that in your pipeline of projects to be able to accommodate that shift?","Richard J. Dugas","Steve, it's Richard. Most of the investment we've been making is in that Pulte brand, with some select Del Webb investment and select Centex investment. So I would suspect that we're going to continue to get really good returns on projects. But by nature of the investment, if you had to say is it going to be more margin- or a pace-driven, because it's Pulte or Del Webb, I would suggest margin would get as much play versus the turn side. In terms of mortgage availability, and it's accommodation for the first-time buyer, as Bob indicated, it's still tight out there. The QM rules have sort of defined the underwriting box. And credit is not particularly easy to get for that buyer category. And I suspect that's partly why we're not seeing the best return opportunities in that category. So we certainly hope that, that opportunity presents itself. And we'll continue to play in that space, clearly. But I'd suggest the majority of our business is going to be driven by the Pulte and Del Webb side over the next 12 to 24 months.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I mean, clearly, Richard, you're correct that the environment today is more challenged in terms of mortgage availability because of the reasons you mentioned. But I think if -- will it play out -- if, over the course of the next 2 years or so, you do see a broadening and some improvement of that situation, how prepared is Pulte to be able to react to that changing buyer mix that you see actually visiting your communities? I would think that, because you have a relatively long land supply, there probably are some communities that maybe are a little bit further flung but -- and also, therefore, maybe more suitable to a Centex-type product mix. I'm kind of curious, first of all, is that supposition correct that some of the older projects you have, maybe from pre-2010, would fit that kind of a buyer? And then secondly, how quickly would it -- could you sort of react to activate those and get models up in the air?","Richard J. Dugas","Steve, I'll try to answer as best I can. Most of the acquisition we've done over the past 2 or 3 years has been communities that have a 2-, 3-, 4-year life. So I would suggest that the long-lived land assets that we have are going to continue for a while, and a lot of those are in Del Webb. So those -- that specific small group, but they have a lot of lots associated with them. We clearly could not modify to accommodate the entry-level buyer. On the other hand, we'll be cycling through, as Bob indicated, 175 new communities next year. I don't know how many in 2015. I would suggest we can be reasonably flexible with regard to new investment. But I think to turn existing investment from one category to another is probably not that easy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit in terms of the land investments relative to what you're seeing on the sales side in the sense that, clearly, I think most everyone's in agreement there's hopefully going to be a short-lived slowdown here. But what is it that you're looking at as you think about sort of increasing land spending? What are the factors that you're thinking about that give you the confidence, aside from thinking, okay, it should be still the third or fourth inning here. How do you look at that in terms of tempering the -- just thoughts in terms of just boosting the land spending?","Richard J. Dugas","Dan, I'll answer that as best I can. I'm not sure I get exactly the question. But we are seeing some really high-quality assets that we're investing in, so we feel comfortable investing in those. We also continue to continually canvass our operations in the field. And they believe, using the very selective, disciplined criteria we have, that they can put money to work in a relatively low-risk way. So while we are an increasing investment, and clearly we are, we're not throwing the kitchen sink at it. We're being very selective. So I feel like the discipline that we have is very helpful. The other thing that certainly gets us more comfortable is the fact that our operational progress, if you will, our mousetrap is much more efficient than it was 12 or 24 months ago. I mean, we're getting exceptionally good returns, we believe. And that gives us increasing confidence that, provided we're smart with our land buying, we can make it return for us. Certainly, we have more confidence in that now than we did a couple of years ago.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And I guess, following up, I'm wondering in terms of the land investments, you talked about the margin's likely to be up over the next several quarters, so room for improvement there. I'm wondering, in terms of the underwriting and in terms of new land investments, presumably those -- the underwriting margins are below the current margins. Is that correct?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","It depends on the nature of the transaction. Some things that we've underwritten absolutely have lower margins than we're experiencing today. Some are at or higher than. It all depends on the return characteristics of the specific transaction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First question, just wanted to ask, on the new communities that you're underwriting for '14 -- and I don't know if you all write them this way or not, but is there an expectation that the per-month orders or the per-quarter orders of these newer communities are going to exceed what we're seeing in the '13 results now?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Essentially, when we underwrite a transaction and -- our expectations are predicated on pricing and paces. When we underwrite the transaction, we are assuming paces consistent with market at that point in time. And so most of the things that will open in '14 were bought earlier, and call it 18 months ago or so. And so I think you'd have to look at that time frame. Paces are up, I think, versus what they were 2 years ago. So the pace expectations, we think, we're pretty comfortable with.","Richard J. Dugas","And, Jay, to be crystal clear, to answer that another way, if you look into '15 or '16, which we're buying land for now, we're not assuming pace or price changes from what we have today. It's a static view in the way we look at it.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into Del Webb. Are you starting to see -- you said -- it sounds, and correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like your opinion of Del Webb and that business right now has improved versus the second quarter conference call. Are you seeing the opportunity to start raising price now? Or was this plus 10% this quarter just a mix change, more options, et cetera?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Jay, it's a little bit of both. And frankly, in some Del Webb communities where we have 2,000 lots left, we're much better off driving pace than price. In other communities, I can think of one in Charlotte where we're winding down the last phases, we're driving price really hard because we only have a year or 2 left before we open up a new community. So it's a blend. I would say the general trend is we prefer pace over price to drive higher returns in Del Webb because of the lot count we have associated with them. Having said that, that buyer category is probably the least price-resistant regarding options, regarding premiums or even base price. So we're trying to be smart about it. And you saw the results of that in Q3.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Richard, is average selling price in Webb is up quarter-over-quarter since last year. So consistent price increases there.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. It's a good business for us right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Builders are generally price takers rather than setters. You just follow the overall market. So if price is going to be kind of settling down a little bit, can you give us a sense of -- how do you create your value benchmark? What actually drives your decision in those areas where you started doing some incentives to go after? And what kind -- type of elasticity did you see?","Richard J. Dugas","Ken, I'll challenge your opening comment a little bit, if you don't mind. This is Richard. We implemented a new pricing strategy a couple of years ago where we started dissecting every single component of price. And I think most of our operators would tell you we are among the price leaders in markets today. And frankly, given the fact that we're dissecting all the pieces of price, we think, kind of like the airlines are charging you for every little individual option or seat choice, we're getting lot premium, we're getting margin -- or excuse me, we're getting base price, we're getting option revenue, and we're lowering discounts where we can. And while that sounds very rudimentary, we were not as disciplined in that years ago. So I would tell you we are doing our best, and it fits with our strategy. We have not been as aggressive as some peers with regard to acquisition of land. We're trying our best to maximize the value of what we have. We feel it fits our disciplined land strategy. So I just wanted to start out by saying we believe, in our case, we're a little bit of price takers. Having said that, we obviously operate in a competitive environment. And we're not unique overall. So we've had to be responsive, but even with the selected incentives that we introduced here in the last 6 or 8 weeks, I'll emphasize it was very selective. We were very conscious not to go across-the-board and just say, \"Let's lower price x percent just to get more volume.\" It was extremely targeted. So sorry to be so long winded. I hope that helped.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, no, that's fine. I guess my second question -- this is what I've been struggling with is I look at the homebuilders, while margins obviously have surged, along with prices, what we see when we look at a builder's absorption pace, actually, is historic seasonality. So seasonal, not cyclical, growth. And your quarter kind of exhibited that, if we look at the pace change quarter-to-quarter. How should we think -- or how do you guys internally think if you're on pace? Historically, your absorption pace flows about 10% in 4Q versus 3Q, and then it's up 35% in 1Q. And we saw a lot of that normal seasonality. How do you guys think about, if we see the normal seasonality, absorptions are the same, your community count basically flat year-over-year next year, and I do appreciate that guidance, but I mean, without the absorptions moving up, and we don't see anything outside of normal seasonality right now, I mean, where do you get confidence that the volume next year would be up for you guys if you're not going to get it in the pace?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Ken, again, we're not giving volume guidance for next year at all. But here's what I'll tell you. The way we look at that is by community-by-community. We have some communities right now, frankly, where we're sold out through Q2 of next year. There's no reason to drive pace or to focus on any incentives there. We have other communities where we've got a couple of more homes left to sell yet for December closings. There, we would be a little bit more selective in focusing on pace. So it's very difficult to give you a generalized answer there. It's more community-by-community.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Roxland of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but just wanted to guess, Richard, on your comment about entitlements taking longer, what have you seen as the biggest impediment, and how much have cycle times been extended as a result?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. It's municipal staffs, frankly. After the downturn, it doesn't appear that a lot of municipalities have ramped up their hiring enough to keep up with the demand. So it's not just the rate of dollars that you want to put into the market, it's the actual pace at which you can get communities open. And we're seeing those slip 2, 3, 4 months relatively routinely. And it's municipal delays in both the entitlement process, as well as sort of the final approvals on your final construction plans for land development, things like that. To be honest with you, Mike, not unexpected. I think, if I could guarantee anything over the next several years, it would be that entitlement times will get lengthened in this industry. It just seems like that's the way it works.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you, okay. And then just a last question on price. Outside of incentives, in those communities where you've seen weakness, have you done anything else in terms of possibly maybe adjusting base prices? Or has it largely been the incentives which have helped you move product?","Richard J. Dugas","It's almost exclusively around option packages that have been offered at better pricing packages. Spend $20,000 with us in options and get $5,000 off, that type of thing. Very little, if any, movement -- I don't think we've done base price changes hardly anywhere. And it's been mostly around incentives and options.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","About gross margins, you mentioned that the 20.9%, post interest, is the highest, I think, since 2Q of '06. In your conversation with Alan, you were describing the potential for gross margins to rise. There's obviously a big difference between a capitalized, amortized interest at this stage at 4.5% versus just over 1% back in 2006. So when you are talking about gross margins potentially rising for the next couple of quarters, are you talking about on a pre-interest or on a post-interest basis?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Nishu, I was speaking on an adjusted basis, if you will, excluding interest. But Bob did give some commentary that we expect capitalized interest to fall as well next year.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And the -- if you do that historical comparison, I believe it's even more impressive if you look at it on a pre-interest basis. So I wanted just to ask, I mean, given the circumstances we had in the beginning of the year with the tremendous price increases, and obviously, that's showing up in gross margins, but we're still at the beginning of the housing recovery, arguably, or in the early innings, call it. What is your view on what normalized gross margin should be now? And if you could frame that in terms of whether you're talking about the adjusted gross margin or the reported?","Richard J. Dugas","Nishu, I appreciate the comments and the complements. It's -- frankly, it depends on what you call normalized in this industry, right? If we got anywhere back to normalized volumes, we could have some exciting numbers. Here's what I would tell you. You have to be realistic about the fact that land prices are going up, there's no question about that, which will have some diminishing or pushdown effect, if you will, on margins. Having said that, we're running a different business: the commonly managed plans, the pricing initiatives, if you will. So I'll put it to you this way. We've been very pleased that we've been able to exceed our own internal plans for margin expansion at this stage. The market's going to kind of dictate where we go from here, but look for us to continue to move on the things that we can control ourselves. Mix is also going to certainly play a role here. We certainly benefited from a mix toward Pulte and toward Del Webb and away from Centex, which historically is more of a pace business. So all of that's going to get cooked into the kettle. But we have visibility for a couple of quarters, and as I indicated to Alan, we see the opportunity for margin from here to go up based on the visibility we have today.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer portion. I'll turn the call back over to the presenter for closing remarks.","James P. Zeumer","Okay. I want to thank everybody for their time this morning.

Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to speak with you this morning about PulteGroup's first quarter operating and financial results. As we said in this morning's press release, the company has gotten off to an exceptional start in 2013, with solid improvement in just about every facet of our business. Our much-improved Q1 earnings reflect a sustained rebound in overall housing demand, combined with our progress toward driving better fundamental business results.","At this time a year ago, the industry was cautiously optimistic that the then budding recovery in housing was not another false start. Now with 5 quarters of generally improving market conditions in the rearview mirror, I think it's safe to say that a sustained recovery in demand for housing is indeed underway.","Given the breadth of our geographic footprint and the diversity of buyers served through our Centex, Pulte Homes and Del Webb brands, it stands to reason that our business trend should mirror many of those seen in the broader industry. As such, it will come as no surprise that we experienced increased buyer traffic visiting our communities, as consumers have grown increasingly excited about the idea of purchasing a new home. You may have read in a recent press release that our own PulteGroup homebuyer index survey showed that even first-time buyers, who many thought would be lifelong renters, remain desirous of owning a new home. According to our most recent millennial survey, 65% indicated that their intention of buying a new home has significantly or somewhat increased in the past year. The drivers of overall housing demand have remained consistent, as favorable demographics are aided by low interest rates, ever-increasing rental prices and the perceived value of owning a new home.","These are certainly positive and important factors, but we continue to believe the primary driver of the recovery in housing demand has been the rapid reduction in the supply of homes available in many markets. A limited supply of homes is creating a greater sense of urgency among potential buyers as they have fewer choices and are facing ongoing appreciation in selling prices.","Regardless of the pricing index you analyzed, you will likely show a positive trend in the price of new and existing homes. Faced with these market dynamics, consumers are anxious to sign a purchase agreement once they have found that perfect home that meets their needs. A recent survey of our division president suggests that we raise prices in upwards of 75% of our communities, with many divisions indicating price increases were taken across the entire market.","As we have talked about in earlier calls, in a number of communities across the country, demand has been so strong that we have taken action to slow the overall pace of sales. While I would expect that everyone listening to the call today is aware of builders taking such action in Phoenix, Tampa and Washington D.C., we are now seeing this in cities as diverse as Austin, Cleveland and Seattle. In fact, while it's tough to get precise data, a recent survey of our division president suggests that we have taken steps to purposefully slow sales to varying degrees in 25% or more of our communities. I am sure that most of you know the answer, but why would we limit sales? Given the lack of land development during the 6 years of housing market downturn, finished lots in the better submarkets are scarce. Accelerating sales pace means that we sellout a neighborhood sooner and have to look to the next community which may not have been developed yet. Although less of an influence, labor constraints in certain markets can also make it prudent to meter the sales pace to help ensure build times are not extended too far into the future.","Given these factors, at present, we believe we can best enhance overall returns on invested capital by focusing on maximizing margin potential, while maintaining an appropriate sales pace. Based on the first quarter earnings that we reported this morning, I think our strategy is proving to be the right one for PulteGroup. As shown in this morning's release, in just 12 months, we have been able to improve our quarterly operating performance significantly, as we posted earnings of $0.21 per share compared to a loss of $0.03 a share last year. These results demonstrate that the momentum which has been building inside the company during 2012 has continued into 2013.","Consistent with our current market strategy and the value creation initiatives we have been pursuing for the past 24 months, we are seeing real gains in our fundamental operating results in the areas of margin, overhead leverage, inventory turns and return to invested capital. In fact, compared to last year, we have been able to increase our adjusted gross margin by 420 basis points while lowering our SG&A by 340 basis points. The combination has driven a significant increase in our homebuilding operating margin and in turn, the company's profitability and returns.","We fully appreciate the market tailwind, but our value creation focus on expanding margins, driving greater overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and generating higher returns on invested capital are allowing us to more effectively capitalize on any broader market gain. And while we are having to manage rising costs for land, labor and materials, we continue to see opportunities for further operational gains going forward.","Our focus on maximizing our homebuilding operations also benefits our balance sheet. A strong cash flow in the quarter helped drive Pulte's cash balance to $1.7 billion. Our liquidity affords us a great deal of flexibility, including our election to again increase our authorized land and development spend in 2013 and 2014, as well as our decision to accelerate our debt paydown with the early redemption of $399 million of 2014 bond maturities.","PulteGroup's first quarter numbers clearly demonstrate the dramatic strides our company is making toward driving better business performance and delivering improved long-term returns on invested capital. Knowing all of the hard work our employees have invested over the past couple of years implementing our underlying value creation initiatives, we are all gratified with today's results. Let me now turn the call to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. As you've heard many times over the last 2 years, we're advancing a number of key initiatives which are focused on improving the company's fundamental operating performance and enabling us to become a more efficient homebuilder. Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making towards running that more efficient and more profitable business.","During the quarter, home sale revenues increased 35% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. The increase in revenue was driven by a 23% increase in closings, to 3,833 homes, combined with a 10% increase in average selling price of $287,000. Consistent with our recent results, the mix of closings in Q1 remained weighted toward our Pulte or move-up communities. The actual mix of closings in the first quarter included 46% for Pulte, 28% for Del Webb and 26% for Centex.","While the closing mix is consistent with the fourth quarter, the percentage of Pulte closings in the first quarter increased by approximately 700 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, while Centex's closings were lower by a comparable amount.","The $26,000 increase in our average selling price realized in Q1 reflects this continued shift in our product mix from the first-time buyer towards the move-up buyer, as well as price increase that's realized within each of our underlying brand.","Land sale revenues in the quarter totaled $26 million, as we continue to opportunistically divest non-core land assets. As always, the uncertain timing of any resulting transactions means that land sale revenues will vary from period to period.","In the first quarter, we reported an adjusted gross margin of 22.9%, which represents an increase of 420 basis points over Q1 of last year and 110 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2012. Gains in the company's adjusted gross margin continue to reflect company-specific and industry-wide factors, including the improved demand in pricing environment, further expansion of our higher-margin move-up buyer business, our strategic pricing initiatives and our ongoing efforts to lower house construction costs. To the last point, we've been talking to you recently about our efforts to manage our design and purchasing processes differently, as we create what we call commonly managed floor plans and work to increase our throughput per plan. As a result, in the future, we'll highlight for you the percentage of our closings from commonly managed floor plans and lose the metric we provided in recent quarters. We believe this metric is more reflective of what we're trying to achieve, as our commonly managed plans have benefited from the work we've done related to our design, costing and purchasing initiatives.","In the first quarter, approximately 12% of our closings were from such commonly managed plans, which is up from 6% in the fourth quarter of last year. Turning to our overheads, we realized further leverage in the quarter as we controlled our spending despite the increase in our closing volume. As a result, SG&A dropped 340 basis points to 11.8% of revenues compared with 15.2% in the first quarter last year. In absolute dollars, SG&A for the period increased 5% to $130 million, driven primarily by incentive compensation. We've spoken in the past about our expectation that we can manage meaningfully higher construction volumes with only modest changes in employee count. Our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our success in that regard.","As Richard highlighted, ongoing initiatives to expand margins, in combination with our focus on driving greater overhead leverage, helped the company to realize a significant increase in our year-over-year operating margin. We continue to advance our underlying initiatives and are optimistic that we can realize additional gains in the coming quarters.","Moving to financial services, the business generated $14 million of pretax income compared with $7 million in the prior year. The biggest driver of the improvement in pretax was a 35% increase in mortgage originations, which totaled 2,722 for the quarter. The growth in originations was due to the increased closing volume in our homebuilding operations, coupled with a 400 basis point increase in our mortgage capture rate to 82%.","The significant gains in our homebuilding volumes and margins, along with higher pretax income for financial services, enabled the company to return to first quarter profitability. In total, we reported a net profit of $82 million or $0.21 per share compared with a net loss of $12 million or $0.03 per share in the prior year. This is our highest first quarter earnings since 2006 and is a reflection of the hard work by PulteGroup employees throughout the organization.","Moving on to our balance sheet, we continue to strengthen our financial foundation as we capitalize on improving market demand and benefit from initiatives to be more efficient within our operations and with our capital. I'd like to highlight that our cash balance increased by $183 million in the first quarter, a period during which we typically experienced a cash outflow to fund our operations.","As a result, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion. The strong cash flow in the period benefited from the higher closing volumes, improved profitability and, to a smaller degree, further reductions in our spec inventory. To that last point, we finished the first quarter with less than 400 finished specs on the ground and with only 1,060 total spec units in production. This is down from more than 1,000 finished specs and more than 2,000 total specs at the end of last year's first quarter. With almost 5,700 homes currently under construction, this means spec production is now below 20%. In addition to the resulting capital efficiency this generates, we continue to see better price and margins when spec inventory is limited.","On our fourth quarter call, we talked about how our improved operating and financial performance gave us the flexibility to increase our authorized land spend in 2013 and '14. Given the additional gains realized in the first quarter, we've made the decision to use cash on hand to opportunistically redeem all of our 2014 senior notes. The transactions, which are expected to be completed in the second quarter, will redeem all $399 million in aggregate principal value of our January and May 2014 maturities. This earlier redemption is expected to lower our debt-to-capital ratio, which was 52% at quarter end, by approximately 400 basis points. It's important to note that, as Richard mentioned, in addition to the debt redemption, we have further increased our authorization for land and related development spend for this year and next. As I mentioned during our fourth quarter conference call, given our return requirements and the escalating land prices being seen in most markets, it will be interesting to see how much of this increased authorization is put to work this year.","In the first quarter, we invested $206 million in land development and acquisitions, including putting approximately 3,200 lots under control. I would also note that our emphasis on efficient use of land assets, including the sale of nonstrategic land assets, has enabled us to decrease our annual spend on soft costs such as taxes and HOA dues by approximately $50 million annually, which represents a decrease of 20% of our soft costs compared to 2 years ago. In other words, $50 million more of our investment is going to land development rather than simply into carrying costs of our land inventory.","Let me now cover several data points before handing the call back to Richard. For the first quarter, net new orders totaled 5,200 homes, which represents an increase of 4% over last year. Higher sign-ups for the period were generated from 14% fewer communities, as we ended the quarter at 650 communities compared with 753 communities at the end of the first quarter last year. The decline in community count is consistent with the outlook we provided at the end of 2012. Breaking down the sign-up numbers a little further, on a year-over-year basis, sign-ups increased 17% and 15%, respectively, at our Pulte and Del Webb communities, while Centex' sign-ups decreased by slightly more than 20%. It's important to note that absorption pace has increased across all 3 of our brands, including an 11% increase in our Centex communities.","We're pleased with the overall level of consumer demand we experienced in the first quarter, including the solid gains in absorption paces, which is in direct alignment with our goals of improving our inventory turns and return on invested capital. Based on the strong customer activity we've experienced, we realized a 290 basis point decrease in our year-over-year sales discounts to go along with the increase in sales prices we're able to achieve.","For the quarter, our discounts were 3.4%. As Richard mentioned, we are focused on raising prices and driving margins of most communities rather than maximizing unit volume sales. The common exception to this is in our larger Del Webb communities, where we will allow volumes to run given the depth of their land position.","And finally, we ended the first quarter with a total of 7,825 homes in backlog valued at $2.4 billion, representing increases of 35% and 52%, respectively. These represent the highest backlog numbers we've carried since the 2007-'08 time frame.","At the end of Q1, we had 5,693 homes under construction. As indicated earlier, only 19% of those units were spec, with the remaining 81% of production already under contract.","In conclusion, let me say there are many positives we've taken out of the quarter, from closing and sign-up volumes to margins, cash flow and profitability. Our Q1 results were important for what they've delivered in the period and how they position us to achieve very strong full year results. Our operations grow increasingly efficient, which is driving improved performance, along with providing us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities when and where they develop. Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. Before we open the call for questions, let me take some time to provide a few high-level comments on the operating conditions we experienced in the first quarter. As you would expect, given the much improved numbers, demand in the quarter remained strong across the majority of our markets. Generally, we experienced higher traffic and better absorption paces, as well as opportunities to realize higher pricing. By geography, demand for our business in the eastern third of the country was strong, from New England right down through Florida. Sales in the Greater Boston Area were particularly robust, as was the sales pace in the Carolinas, down and through Tennessee and into Georgia. Demand in Florida continue to rebound as inventory levels remain low and buyers continue returning to the market. Market conditions in the middle third of the country also showed continued strength in the quarter. Demand in the Midwest was generally strong, with limited lot supply and the need to meter our sales, often being as big an influence on our sign-up pace as outright buyer demand.","Demand across Texas remains strong, although reported sign-ups were little changed as we opted to slow pace and focus on price, while we work to get new communities online throughout the state.","In the western third of the country, we continue to experience strong buyer interest throughout our operations, from the Pacific Northwest down through California and into Arizona and Nevada. We have, however, meaningfully limited sales pace in most communities throughout this region of the country as we managed the land pipeline and labor availability. Echoing some of Bob's comments, we are pleased and very encouraged by our first quarter results, as they demonstrate the continued recovery in both the company and the overall U.S. housing market. Every day, we hear questions about the parameters of a housing recovery and whether it is sustainable or what the slope of demand is and how quickly can the industry get back to normal volumes. While these are important questions, they remain out of our control. So we are focusing on PulteGroup and on running a better business.","Don't get me wrong, we certainly keep a close eye on demand within our local markets and specific communities, but we see significant opportunities to drive better performance from within our operations, consistent with the value creation work we have been pursuing for the past 2 years. I would like to recognize each of our employees for their contributions to the strong results PulteGroup reported today. While there is work left to be done, you have a lot to be proud of. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Jessica, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Richard, I think one of the things you taught me about analyzing your business is that really it's difficult to focus on community count as it's a very different business especially in Del Webb. So maybe if you could just help us going forward how we should be thinking about trying to model order activity, because it sounds like you were pleased across the board with your overall performance and yet, the orders on even a per community basis were a little bit lighter than we'd expected, even when you're trying to push price. So if you can help us going forward in maybe what community count should look like by year end, I think that would be very helpful for everyone.","Richard J. Dugas","Sure, Ivy. We're still comfortable with our community count guidance in the range of 10% to 15% down for the year, although it's likely going to be toward the higher end of that range. What I would tell you is that in addition to the community count being a little difficult to analyze for us given our longer positions in some communities, we are really focused on driving price and margin as opposed to pace, and we tried in our prepared comments to really emphasize the degree to which we feel like we're taking price and limiting sales. So while we're not going to provide sign-up guidance, I will tell you that we're very pleased with the overall level of activity in the market, and candidly, we feel like we're executing our playbook exactly as we anticipated.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And with that playbook in mind, when we think about the superb margin performance in the quarter, I think everyone can see the opportunity. Would you expect that the performance -- because you've mentioned that you've done things structurally that have allowed for some of that margin expansion above and beyond just pricing, can you talk about your outlook as it relates to further margin improvement, and is there a governor on margin improvement on a go-forward basis? Or could we be happy to see if pricing continues and some of the benefits from the structural changes you've made will continue to reap benefits to shareholders?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ivy, from a margin standpoint, a couple of things. We feel like we're benefiting from a multiple effect from, not only our construction efficiencies and a common plan in management work that Bob referenced. Clearly the mix shift is helping us. Also, our pricing discipline is evident in a whole number of arenas outside of just what is typically thought of as base price, things like premiums and options, lower discounts. And then land value is appreciating over time, as well. So we do see further margin expansion from here. It's not going to be in a straight line. As we've said before, it can be choppy depending on mix deliveries quarter-over-quarter. But we're confident we've got more in this gas tank.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is about traffic and sales pace at Del Webb, and really just about how that's kind of faring if the pickup that you're seeing is kind of been universal into the Del Webb product, and your expectations kind of on a go-forward basis for where demand is going to be in the Del Webb products the next few quarters?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, David, Richard here. As Bob indicated, Del Webb was up about 16% year-over-year. We're pleased with that performance. And it's following the script that we kind of envisioned, where that buyer continues to get more and more comfortable with the housing market, continues to have more opportunities to sell existing homes and are feeling better about their overall financial position as clearly the stock market has continued to perform. So I would say, slow and steady from here is our expectation for Del Webb. It's unfolding about as we expected.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then my second question was on the 2014 land spend guidance. And really the question is obviously bringing that up is a positive sign, but the question is, do you think you're going to have to bring it up more as you kind of look forward? Just given the sales pace is obviously strong, the market's improving, things are getting better, do you need to spend more than $1.4 billion on land as you kind of look forward? And maybe can you talk about the parameters on what would make you raise the guidance further?","Richard J. Dugas","So David, Richard here. I'll start and then turn it to Bob for a second. I think the thing that we realized is that we have a real disciplined process in place today around how we're going to look at land spend. And if you can think of it this way, our current homebuilding operation is getting better and better, and we really like that. So we're getting more and more comfortable putting more money into a more efficient machine, if you will. Having said that, the discipline with which we are looking at land is not changing, and land's not on sale right now. It's expensive. So with that, maybe Bob can give a little more character on how we're looking at it and what might make us change our assumptions going forward.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, I think as Richard said, we're looking at it with a consistent lens as we go forward. And one of the things that we're actually thinking about, I think to your question on sales basis is, what is happening to us for market share in each individual market. So we're looking at the overall business and say, what cash are we generating and how much do we want to invest? And then saying, where do we best invest it? Where are the opportunities to invest based on our view of forward business opportunities? And also where do we need to invest to maintain critical relative market share or market share in general? So I think it's a 2-step process that looks at how do we feel about the business and then specifically in markets, make sure that we're keeping the leverage there that we think is appropriate.","Richard J. Dugas","David, Richard. One more follow-up comment to Bob's. We feel we're much better off to stick to A-plus properties, and the discipline we have to really evaluate this continually on an evergreen basis, we believe, is better than plopping a huge amount of money into the market in one shot and then kind of seeing what happens over the year. So as an example, if we were going to invest $100 over the year, we think it's more prudent to do it in $25 increments, giving us the flexibility to see how much further we're driving the current operations, as well as targeting A-plus locations, versus the natural tendency if you allocated that $100 all at once to maybe buy some B and C properties. We made that mistake in the past with a lot of investment in one time, and we don't want to do that again. It's all about ROIC now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Jason Aaron Marcus - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Jason Marcus, in for Mike. My first question is, I was wondering if you could comment on some of the recent trends in raw material costs and labor, and in terms of how much your overall construction costs have increased over the last year, and how that might have impacted your margins during the quarter. And also which markets are you seeing the most in terms of labor issues?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Sure, we have provided, I think, coming into the year, that we were planning for $2,000 to $2,500 in known increases in costs, and a lot of that is labor. What we've seen is that -- if we were to update that number today, it's probably $1,000 or $1,200 higher, and the primary driver of the difference is lumber, obviously, I think everybody is aware that lumber prices have risen pretty significantly, and labor. I think where you're seeing labor pressure the most is in the markets that have had the most rapid increase in production over the last year or 2, so, think markets like Phoenix.","Jason Aaron Marcus - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my next question is, I was wondering if you'd be able to provide any color on the order growth by month. And also, if you could comment on what -- maybe what you're seeing in April, so far.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Jason, this is Richard. We saw consistent growth through the quarter, although we purposely tamped down sales activity and drove price even more through the quarter. So that influenced our trends a little bit. And we're pleased with the resulting sales pace we've seen so far in April.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up a little bit on the cost and pricing. If you look at your ASPs right now, how much of that was mix versus true pricing power? And then how much are you getting -- how much is that over your cost that you're seeing right now? And then within that pricing power that you're actually receiving, how much of that is lot premium versus options spend versus your base price?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, it gets a little bit complicated because there's a whole lot of mix involved in all that. But what I can tell you is if you look at the $287,000 average ASP, that breaks down 342 for Pulte, 193 for Centex and 285 for Del Webb. And those are -- so Pulte was up 8% over first quarter last year, Centex was up 2% over first quarter last year and Del Webb was up 4% over last year. So none of those are over 8%, yet our average price is up 10%, that's the mix differential. But again, we're seeing price increases across all 3 brands.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if you look at lot premium and options spend, I know you all are putting a big focus on that and...","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. What you'd also find is that in the quarter, quarter-over-quarter average -- so we've told you that we raised prices in a significant number of communities, that discount was down 210 basis points versus last year. And so despite those 2 things, what you would find is that our option revenue was up about 18% per unit, which is about $6,000. And our lot premium revenues is up about $2,000 a unit, which is about 40% of lot premium. So we're seeing that we're able to drive increases across all elements of price.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then Richard, just going back to the land spend in the community count, I appreciate what you all are trying to do. And you all -- you are spending a lot of money in -- over the last 18 months or so, you said, \"Hey, we've got the land bank, et cetera.\" Are you at a point now where you talked about buying the A+-type stuff? Are you at the point now where the land that you own is, with the increased demand is now in a good-enough position that as we start moving into the back half of the year and into 2014, your community growth actually starts to improve?","Richard J. Dugas","Steven, we had indicated that we thought community count wouldn't turn until '14, given the allocation that we authorized last quarter. And the incremental allocation this quarter isn't going to move the needle on '13. It takes a while to kind of do that. So I wouldn't look for community count to turnaround until sometime in '14. Having said that, I hope you can appreciate it's a substantial increase in our overall land investment, vis-a-vis what we were in '11 or '12 where we are. And you're on the order of roughly 40% increases in overall land investment, which is substantial. So we feel like we're doing a really good job of monitoring our land spend and doing it appropriately. And community count is going to fall in the interim period. That's okay, and as we think we demonstrate this quarter, there's more than one way to get to an earnings number, and to the extent that we continue focusing on our operations, those are good dollars to bring to the bottom line. I know some folks are anxious for more growth, but we're pretty happy with the way things are playing out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Richard, given the focus that you've been talking about on margins and returns, when we try to think about Pulte a couple of years out or Pulte through the cycle, is there an ideal or a targeted size of the company you're focusing on? Not sure what the best metric to ask is. Is it revenues, inventory closings, community count? Can you just share what you think about that?","Richard J. Dugas","Adam, as Bob indicated, we do concern ourselves with a relevant market share in markets. So we're very focused on staying to be a large enough player in the key markets we're in to be able to leverage our trade base, to be able to have good land positions, et cetera. Having said that, volume is not the focus for the company these days. We think we've been very consistent about that. It's driving better returns. We certainly are going to remain a very large, if not the largest builder by revenue. And it's all about return on invested capital for us going forward. So I don't know what to tell you regarding a specific size of the organization other than to tell you, we feel like we're running a very smart business. We're delevering; at the same time, we're adding incremental investment. We're driving better business from our current assets. It's a really nice combination overall. So we're pleased, and we think shareholders are going to really benefit over the long run from this focus on return.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just going to spec -- the Centex. What happened with community count in Centex? And what are you finding in terms of the land opportunities there? And how do you expect that mix to -- do you expect it to continue to decline as an overall contributor?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, this has been a consistent fact for us over the last couple of years. You have seen community count dropping. It did drop in the current quarter. And I would tell you it is likely to continue to drop because the majority of the investment that we've made -- and this isn't just in the last 3 months, but over the last 2 years, has been in the move-up category. And we've talked about it a lot. Not that we don't like the business, it's just that given the economics and the velocity that we see, the returns work better on the move-up business. So we're seeing pace is increasing faster there. We see higher returns, and so our investment has been substantially towards that part of the segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Mike Dahl on for Dan. Just a quick follow-up on that last Centex point. I guess if you just think about your company longer term and the broader housing market, you would expect that the entry level does have to play a much bigger role as we look out over the next few years. So is that something that you will plan to reinvest in the future? Or is this a more permanent shift?","Richard J. Dugas","This is Richard, Mike. We definitely plan to invest in this segment in the future. And we are investing in the segment today. It's just being outstripped by our investment in, particularly the move-up category today. As Bob indicated, it's all about driving the best returns for shareholders. And right now, that seems to be in the move-up category, and that doesn't mean that the intra-level category is not a big player in the future. We continue to invest in that brand and are working hard to find transactions that make sense for it.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess along the same lines appreciating that return focus. How do you think about your spec strategy, not just today where you're having to actually manage sales lower in a lot of areas. But just on a go-forward basis, do you plan to increase specs as you look out and you have more communities online, or what should we expect there?","Richard J. Dugas","I really appreciate that question because it gives me the opportunity to really complement our team for driving specs to their lowest level in years. We currently -- we got less than 400 finished specs about 1\/3 of what they were at this time in 2012. And Mike, to the go forward strategy, we love the very limited spec strategy. It's really about limiting finished spec inventory. We're happy to put specs into production, but our teams are keenly focused on selling them at full margin before they final, where we can do that. We're happy to put specs in, but don't look for us to revert to the ways we had a few years ago where we put a lot of spec in the ground. I think Bob indicated about 19% of our business was in spec and 81% presale. I like that percentage, and we'd like to drive it as far as we can because it provides very consistent visibility for our sold backlog. It supports our overall pricing and margin focus. It helps with inventory turns because we're not carrying a lot of finished inventory on spec. And it helps our SG&A because we're not having to cut the grass and heat these homes that don't have buyers in them. So I'd call that a win-win-win-win-win. I have a couple -- I have one more for you. If you look year-over-year, we've taken $75 million out of house. And that's despite the fact that we've got in total, 5% more units under construction. So the ability to drive down final specs and final sold units has allowed us to take all that money out of working capital. We've reinvested it in homes that are sold and despite that, driven a $75 million increase. It decreased our investment in-house.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The success you've had on your fixed G&A cost is obviously evident. Would you expect your fixed G&A cost to still be trending down in line with, I guess, your incremental community declines this year?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, certainly, if communities close, we do have a relative savings. You don't have the cost of maintaining the model. You may have 1 or 2 less people on staff. But I would suggest that, that doesn't change the landscape very much. Just like we've said, if we scale up on production, we don't have to go hire a bunch of people, invest a lot in SG&A. It doesn't go away immediately either, because we're pretty efficient on how we're structured.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the community count that you'll have at the end of the year given your 10% to 15% decline, can you talk about how much of that is, I guess, legacy as opposed to stuff that you bought in the last 2 years? Just to get a sense of mix, what's closing and perhaps, where we'll be entering '14 from a mix basis?","Richard J. Dugas","I don't have that data in front of me, Ken. We can probably get back to you with it. I think in most recent quarters, we had talked about somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%, but I'm not exactly sure. Jim, do you know?","James P. Zeumer","It's about 30% right now.","Richard J. Dugas","Roughly 30%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","You talked a little bit about some of the headwinds in terms of labor and purposely slowing on the order growth side. Can you just talk us through a little bit? If those things, we should think about modeling them in terms of your ability or your timing in terms of closing backlog and backlog conversion going forward.","Richard J. Dugas","Megan, if I understand the question correctly, I think with our focus on presales and lack of specs, we have pretty good visibility into our backlog quarter-by-quarter at this stage. We did indicate on our Q4 call, though, that conversion rates for the backlog are going to be limited because we're carrying a larger backlog. And without a lot of spec inventory to add, \"upside,\" in the current quarter, you're not going to see that. But I guess the best way that I would think about it is to expect us to have a relatively consistent business going forward. I don't know if I'm answering your question, or maybe I didn't understand it right.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","No, I think you did. I was just trying to think about going forward if -- backlog conversion was a little choppy last year, so it's hard to get a sense of seasonal patterns there. If we should expect it to continue to slow, and then have sort of a ramp-up in the fourth quarter, which is relatively consistent industry-wide, of if there's anything else going on there we should think about?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I think you're going to have some of that, just the way the natural pace of the business flows. You generally sell more homes in the front half of the year than the back half, so I don't think anything is going to change the trend of Q4 being the biggest closing quarter. Having said that, we're doing our best to not get too far out with our backlog, in order to be able to control the next quarter or 2. And we purposely told our operators, even if you have the ability to sell a year out, we prefer 6, 7 months of backlog to protect ourselves against price increases as well as our cost increases, as well as ability to take price. So we're really happy with how that's going. I would love for us to get to 25% each quarter. I don't think that's realistic, but we're going to push more in that direction, if that can help you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Locker with FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Curious on if you were thinking of expanding in any markets in the next year? If you had your eye on any specific markets.","Richard J. Dugas","Joel, this is Richard. We definitely have expansion plans in many markets. It's all based on our current capital position in the market, our relative market share in the market. And in some cases, we're really happy with our overall position and are not adding a lot of capital. In others, we're aggressively growing the business, but when you got a business as big as ours, it's across the board, that authorized incremental land spend is going to play out over time. But yes, definitely, there are markets where we're adding additional capital at a rapid rate.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","No, I'm saying specifically on any new markets that you had, that you entered...","Richard J. Dugas","I'm sorry, I apologize. No, we're not looking at any new markets that I can think of now. As Bob indicated, we're really focused on driving relative market share within the markets we're in, which last time I checked, we were in the vast majority of all the permits in the country with the MSAs we had covered.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right, and one last one on the tax valuation allowance. Do you see that coming back on in 2014?","Richard J. Dugas","We actually will be filing our Q today. And what we'll say in there is that consistent with I think we said at the end of the year, it's our expectation that if business conditions continue the way they have, that we would likely be able to reverse a large part of it sometime in the back half of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had a question. You had mentioned migrating towards a common floor plan, and that 12% of your deliveries now, are using that. What's the difference from a gross margin standpoint between using a standardized floor plan versus a customized floor plan?","Richard J. Dugas","Bob, this Richard. We definitely see better margins in commonized floor plans. It's hard to give you a specific number, but it is part of the margin improvement story that we've had now for 9 consecutive quarters. And the best news there for us is at 12%, you can see that it's kind of in its early innings. We have 6 specific product and purchasing zones around the company. And we're rolling this process out to all of them this year. Some like Texas, are much further along, we'll have much higher percentage of closings there. But as we roll into other parts of the country, it will go up. So to answer your question, better margins. Wouldn't want to give you a specific number on how much better.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, it's helpful. Your average order price, ASP was up 13.3%, which just a test of much better price discipline and favorable mix trends. how do you see that working out during the balance of the year, given your big emphasis on driving ROIC?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I would continue to expect it to get a lot of attention, vis-a-vis letting our operators sell a bunch more homes. To be crystal clear, we could sell a lot more homes in the given quarter than we are right now. But we don't think it will drive the most favorable ROIC effort for us. So the thing to think about, with pricing, as Bob indicates is, it's not just base price. It's options, it's lot premiums, it's base price, it's managing discounts. It's managing all the factors. And best way, if I were you to think about it, is we're really doing a good job at disaggregating the pieces of price. We have very good visibility into that today. And we're focused on driving each one of them as far as we can. We've been real pleased with what that increased visibility has done to all components of price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Obviously, you guys are talking about a lot of things that are very favorable, particularly as it relates to metering sales for price. This is something obviously we're also hearing from a lot of other builders. But I particularly wanted to understand how the extremely strong demand environment of late, has -- what effect that's having on your strategic repositioning strategy. I would think that the very strong demand should allow you to accelerate the process of restructuring your operations. And so in that vein, it would seem also by extension, that in 2014, when you are ready to begin expanding your community count, that perhaps we might be able to see you expand that more aggressively than your peers. Can you just comment on that thought process, and what it means for 2014 in light of the extremely strong demand that probably is greater than you had originally envisioned?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, Steven. I would say this, first of all, when you talk about strategic repositioning, I assumed you mean with regard to our land investment strategy. And we feel like we've done an excellent job of ensuring that we have a better operating platform before we plow a lot of additional funds in, and particularly, given our long land position as a company. And you've certainly seen the benefits and our quarterly earnings from that strategy. It's important to note that our decisions today are not going to manifest themselves for 18 to 24 months from capital authorized today before they come online. So we feel like we're making those decisions today. And with all due respect, we feel like 40%, plus or minus, incremental increase in capital is a big one. It may not match those of a couple of our peers, but we're doing our very best to stay disciplined on the A+ properties where we can continue to drive great results and not get caught up in let's grow because the market is really strong. It doesn't do us a lot of good to grow if we're not going to grow extremely profitably and driving a lot of that to the bottom line, so...","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Richard, but I guess what I'm asking is that when 2014 comes, in light of the very significant ramp in investment that you've been making, can we see that manifest itself in a greater subdivision count growth next year relative to a relatively more depressed 2013 compared to your peers?","Richard J. Dugas","I think if I understand, our ability to open communities doesn't get impacted by the work we're doing around commonly managed floor plans and trying to be efficient. At the end of the day, you still have to go through -- and actually, if the land is raw, you have to go through the entitlement process. You actually have to spend development dollars. All that is -- are things that are outside of the purview of we're going build houses more efficiently. So it\u2019s a 2-step process: one is to get the land ready; 2 is to then build on it. And at the end of the day, interestingly, what we're seeing today is more raw land opportunities. Finished lots, you've heard many people talk about it are very scarce and so we're taking bigger land positions. We're going to have to take -- put development dollars to work. So it's not as simple as, Okay, you've spent a lot more money. We're going to see community count because it depends on how you spend the money. And the market dictates that, to some degree.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James McCanless with Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","What was the can rate in the quarter?","Richard J. Dugas","The cancellation rate was 13%.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, could you break that out by segment?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, we've got that. We're trying to find it, Jay, hang on just 1 second.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And the second question I had, while you're looking for that is could you discuss the thought process of maybe buying some private competitors to accelerate the neighborhood count or accelerate the lock count rather than increasing the spending up to $1.4 billion and doing it yourself?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, so on that comment, overall, that's always been part of the land strategy overall. It's just a question of whether the economics work. So that's definitely part of what we would and always do consider candidly. So Jim, I think you have the other number?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, the cancellation rates, it's 11% for Pulte for the quarter; 20% for Centex for the quarter; and 9% for Del Webb.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with Susquehanna International Group.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A follow-up, I think, on Megan's question on backlog conversion. Just to maybe ask it a different way. 59% this quarter, net down from, I think, 79% last quarter. Is 59% the right kind of number? Does it go below 59%, I guess to the balance of the year is the question?","Richard J. Dugas","Jack, it's not a number candidly that we focus a lot on internally. So we're a little off the cuff trying to answer this, but I wouldn't say it's a bad number. We're pretty pleased with the rate at which we metered out sales this quarter are very limited to drive margins.","James P. Zeumer","The only thing I'd add is and Richard highlighted this before, the sales environment is seasonal. So you're going to see more activity in the front half of the year for sales. And just based on construction cycles, that means you're going to see more construction deliveries in the back half of the year. And so I don't know that you want to look at it on a steady state. It's not going to be the same quarter by quarter, but year-over-year, you shouldn't see significant fluctuations. So if we're 59% in this quarter, first quarter next year, likely should be 59%, absent some significant change in the business environment. So sales accelerated or sales decelerated, for some reason. But what we're trying to do is get production flow more even. So again, we've got roughly 6 months of production in backlog at maximum, so you wouldn't see that change over time.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","That's perfect. That's absent seasonality, the numbers are probably where they're at, okay. And on the note redemption side, obviously, there's going to be a lift to margin there. Do you have other redemption opportunities there? And how do you think about going out -- you've got the cash build, you've got profit over volume. Land price is going up. I mean are there other notes we can potentially see this happen with? And is there a point where it's just a better return outlook to do more of this type of transaction versus lands? How are you guys thinking about that?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, I think we look at capital in the aggregate, obviously. And so yes, we have a lot of cash available today. We were looking at the '14 because under the make-whole provisions, we actually can invest the money at more accretive rates than we could invest in the money markets right now. In terms of the impact on margins, that's more of a prospective thing, so that will benefit margins not in '13, but '14, '15, '16 kind of a timeframe. And that's true of all the reductions that we've had over time. And as we look at our total capital picture, we look at the entire debt structure, we look at whether we're -- we've got opportunities to either take things out or refinance them more attractively. And obviously, we'll always think about, if we've got excess liquidity, how might its dividend or share repurchase fit into that. Again, we look at it in total.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to circle back to the increase in the land spend to $1.4 billion annually. Richard, if I listen to a couple of the other things you're saying, obviously, land prices have risen a lot. It's tough to find deals that pencil. You folks have developed this discipline in terms of capital allocation, and you intend to stick to it. You're not going to chase volumes, obviously. The pace of land spend, if I heard you correctly, I think you mentioned it was just over $200 million in the first quarter. So not at quite a pace of $1.4 million. So it sounds like if things remain as they are right now, you may have difficulty reaching that $1.4 billion . So is the right way to think about this $1.4 billion as more just how much your balance sheet allows as opposed to just how much money you're going to force into the system?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","It's Bob, sorry. That's exactly right. So we've got visibility, obviously, into most of our spend for '13 already. As Richard highlighted, anything we're doing today is really going to be for future production. So we have pretty good visibility into what our spend will be right now for the balance of the year. Obviously, we have folks spending a lot of time looking for transactions that some may fund this year, some may fund next year. It depends on structure. So if we go out and buy a lot of raw land with 100% purchase, that burns money this year. We're asking people to try and find terms. So even on raw, do we get it on option takes? You've got some spend this year, you've got some spend in the future. How does the development dollar spend fit into that? So again, we've highlighted the fact that we've authorized them to commit us to $1.4 billion in spend. But that we weren't sure they all get spent this year. And it's either because we can't find return accretive things, or because we'll tie up land this year and actually make some of the spend next year.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And if I remember, that must be the base figure that we've been talking about, the $950 million or $1 billion. I wanted to make sure to get my second question in, but if you can just clarify that. And my second question was on SG&A. Terrific job on SG&A. It only went up 5%, mostly as you mentioned, incentive comp. Your homebuilding revenues went up more than 1\/3. So if I think about the variable components of SG&A, the commissions and the co-broke, that implies that on a level SG&A base, against the 35% increase in the home building revenues, that there were parts of your SG&A that were contracting meaningfully. Now you obviously mentioned that the decline in community count is something that helps there. But I just wanted to understand, what is declining so substantially, and what have you been so successful in, in actually reducing outright so significantly?","Richard J. Dugas","Nishu, one thing you have to remember is we've actually got commissions up in cost of sales, so that big variable piece that you're looking for is actually going through margin, not through SG&A. So I would suggest there's -- I mean there's lots and lots of moving pieces. But really the primary driver of the change in SG&A was compensation related to the improved performance of the business.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Nishu, to add to that, we have said pretty consistently, we felt like we could ramp the business 30%, 40%, plus or minus, without adding a lot of SG&A. And I think that's what we're demonstrating here very pointedly in this quarter. We've got significant ramp up in revenue and total business without much change in SG&A, so we feel good about that. And the leverage from here, we feel good about. I think you had, had a follow-up question with regard to the land piece. The $950 million to $1 billion was kind of our previous level of spend in '11 and '12. And we had increased that last quarter to the kind of $1.2 billion level and a little more in '14. To be clear, that's now at the $1.4 billion authorized level for '13 and '14. And just to note and highlight something Bob said, a good portion of that's development spend, right? So every single incremental dollar is not into a new land transaction, per se. It's development spend in communities that are running faster, that type of thing. So we feel good about that. And then to your question about whether or not that's the maximum that the balance sheet will allow, I would suggest the balance sheet would allow more than that. But we are being very disciplined around how we're thinking about it. And candidly, you're seeing us redeem some notes. Bob mentioned we're looking at all uses of capital. So gone are the days where every available free dollar's going to go back into development in land for the company. We want to drive the best returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Wondering if you could provide the mix of financing that your buyers use? If you have that data, the splits between FHA mortgages or conforming mortgages? And also if you -- have you seen an uptick in the number of cash buyers recently?","Richard J. Dugas","I would tell you that the mix of business is about the same. It's about 1\/3, government spec. And in terms of cash buyers, I haven't heard anything substantial around that. And if you think about it, if you look at our mortgage origination, they're up 35% year-over-year. That's -- the builder was only up 23% year-over-year. Again, we had capture rate, so we're getting more of the business, which tells me that there's probably less -- or not less, but not a significant change in cash buyers.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And do you have the number of finished lots you had on balance sheet? And also, roughly, how many mothballed lots are still on the balance sheet?","Richard J. Dugas","The finished lots are about 1\/3. It's pretty consistent with where we were last year. And we've struggled with the mothball concept over time again, because of our Del Webb position. So we haven't provided a mothball number.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","Jim Zeumer","Thank you, Chris and good morning. I\u2019m pleased to welcome you to PulteGroup\u2019s conference call and webcast to review operating and financial results for our second quarter ended June 30, 2019. Here with me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll also post an audio replay of today\u2019s call to our website a little later today.","We want to point out that PulteGroup\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2018 included several unusual items which were noted in our earnings release. As part of today\u2019s call, we will comment on our reported results, as well as our 2018 financial results adjusted to exclude the impact of these items. We\u2019ve provided reconciliation of these adjusted 2018 numbers to the reported results in our earnings release and within the webcast slides posted as part of this morning\u2019s call. We encourage you to review this information to assist in your analysis of our year-over-year Q2 results.","Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Jim and good morning. I\u2019m excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results and I\u2019m pleased to say that on a seasonally adjusted basis, market conditions for the second quarter and the first six months of 2019 remained consistently stronger than what we experienced through the back half of 2018.","Further based on feedback from our operators, I\u2019d tell you that the market generally felt stronger in Q2 than in Q1 with mortgage rates down roughly 75 basis points from the start of the year, it\u2019s easy to understand how market momentum continued to advance as the year progressed.","Our second quarter performance reflects this momentum build as orders increased 7% over the last year. This is a notable swing after orders were lower in the first quarter of 2019 compared with Q1 of the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, orders were a little slow in April, but then we realized strong gains as the quarter progressed. While there are always a number of factors that influence the home buying decision, it is reasonable to assume the decline in interest rates had some impact in attracting additional buyers.","As it relates to the current sales environment, I\u2019ll paraphrase my comments from our first quarter earnings call in saying that through the first six months of 2019, we\u2019ve experienced what we view as a typical seasonal recovery in buyer demand. It is great to see that consumer demand has been so resilient this year given the soft sales environment in the back half of 2018.","I think that this characterization is consistent with the government data which show new home sales through the first five months of 2019 were up 4% over the comparable period last year. It is certainly nice to see the year-over-year increase, but as important we're not seeing signs of a pending fall-off in demand like the industry experienced starting towards the middle of last year. I'm not sure that lower rates will materially alter typical seasonal buying patterns, but we see no obvious signs of a replay of 2018's back half slowdown.","In a couple of minutes, Bob will provide details on our second quarter operating results and our strong performance across key metrics including orders, closings, margins, EPS and returns. I want to take a moment however, to highlight that along with great financial performance, our second quarter offers a great example of PulteGroup continuing to execute its playbook.","Operationally, we delivered against our objective to effectively balance price and pace to achieve high returns while taking every opportunity to drive ASPs, revenues and gross margins. We then allocated the resulting strong cash flows in alignment with our stated priorities. This included investing $857 million of land acquisition and development in the business including the American West transaction in the second quarter. As a reminder through the American West acquisition, we put 3,500 lots under control in Las Vegas.","In addition to dramatically improving our size and scale in the Vegas market, the deal structure is extremely capital efficient as we purchased only one-third of the lots while controlling the other two-thirds via option. Along with investing in the growth of our business, we returned $114 million to shareholders in the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends bringing the total of our returns to shareholders to over a $170 million this year. I would also highlight that our Board approved a $500 million increase to our share repurchase authorization during the quarter.","And finally, during the quarter we also completed a tender for $274 million of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2021. This repurchase helped to lower the company's debt to capital ratio to 35% on a gross basis, which is well within our guidance range of 30% to 40%. Perhaps most importantly, the strong cash flows generated by our business allowed us to implement these actions and still in the quarter with more than $650 million of cash. I can tell you that in prior cycles, our capital allocation would have likely looked very different than this with most if not all available capital invested into the business.","Our more balanced approach including a measured increase in land spend is consistent with our capital allocation priorities and with our view that this current housing cycle can continue to move higher.","Now let me turn the call over to Bob.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. As Jim noted, our second quarter results in 2018 included several unusual items which impacted our reported numbers for that period. Where appropriate, I'll highlight these items and discuss reported as well as adjusted numbers to provide a clearer picture of our year-over-year performance.","For the second quarter, we reported 6,792 net new orders which represent an increase of 7% over last year. Breaking down orders by buyer group shows first-time orders increased 30% to 2,099 homes. Move-up orders increased 3% to 3,043 homes while active adult orders were lower by 7% to 1,650 homes.","For the quarter, we operated out at 877 communities, which is an increase of 3% over last year. Adjusting for community count, absorption pace and total was up 4% driven by increases of 14% and 5% respectively the first-time and move-up orders. Pace among active adult communities was down 13%.","Specific to the second quarter, the lower pace among active adult communities reflects the closeout of several high volume neighborhoods in combination with replacements opening later in the quarter. More broadly, this buyer group is generally more cautious and appears to be rebounding at a slower pace following the weakness in the back half of 2018.","I would like to point out that we realized approximately 100 signups from the 11 communities that we acquired in connection with the American West transaction that closed during the quarter. While we expect orders will continue to pace between 30 to 50 per months for the balance of the year from these assets, we don't expect to realize any closings related to American West until the first quarter of next year. In total, we currently expect to realize approximately 600 closings from the American West assets in 2020.","Looking at our income statement, home sale revenues for the second quarter were down 2% to $2.4 billion. Revenues for the period reflected 1% increase in average sales price to $430,000 offset by a 3% decrease in closings to 5,589 homes. ASP and closing volumes for the quarter were both in line with company guidance. In the second quarter, ASPs of $364,000 and $486,000 for first-time and move-up buyers respectively were effectively flat with last year, while active adult pricing gained 6% to $411,000. The increase in average selling price with an active adult is due primarily to a change in the geographic mix of homes closed in the period.","Closings by buyer group for the second quarter consisted of 30% first-time, 44% move-up and 26% active adult. In Q2 of last year, closings were 29% first time, 47% move-up, and 24% active adults. At the end of the second quarter, the company had a backlog of 11,793 homes under contract which is comparable with the prior year period. We also ended the quarter with 11,454 homes in production which is up 3% from last year.","Of the homes currently being built, 8,528 or 74% are sold while the remaining 26% are spec. Consistent with comments provided on previous calls, spec production has come back into historical ranges following the strategic decision to allow specs to rise in the back half of 2018.","Based on the current volume of homes under construction, we expect third quarter deliveries to be in the range of 5,700 to 6,000 homes. Further, we currently expect full year 2019 closings to be in the range of 22,300 to 22,800 homes.","Given the average sales price for homes in backlog and pricing trends in the market, we expect our average sales price in closings for the remainder of the year to be in the range of $425,000 to $430,000. While we are seeing some opportunities to capture incremental price in the market, we also expect our mix of first time closings to increase slightly over the back half of the year which will influence our reported ASP.","Company's second quarter gross margin was 23.1%, which is consistent with our previous guide. The lower margins compared with last year reflects higher land, labor and material cost as well as the more competitive market conditions that developed in the back half of 2018.","While down slightly from last year, our gross margins continue to benefit from our strategic pricing program as a resulting gains in option revenues and lot premiums. For the second quarter option revenues and lot premiums increased 5.9% or $4,653 to $84,082 per home.","On a year-over-year basis sales discounts for the quarter were up 80 basis points to 3.9% or $17,600 per home. It\u2019s worth highlighting that our higher option revenues and lot premium offset most of the increased we incurred in sales discount. I would also note that sequentially discounts in Q2 were flat on a dollar basis and down 10 basis points from the first quarter of this year.","Well, market conditions generally remain competitive and incentives continue to be elevated, buyer demand has clearly improved from the end of 2018. Given these market dynamics, we expect gross margins to be relatively stable over the back half of 2019. We currently expect gross margins to be in the range of 22.8% to 23.3% for the third quarter. Based on our expectations for the balance of the year combined with our performance to the first two quarters of the year, we currently expect our gross margins for the full year to be in the range of 23% to 23.3%.","SG&A expense in the second quarter was $259 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues. Reported SG&A expense of $226 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues in Q2 of last year included a pre-tax benefit of $38 million associated with insurance adjustments taken in the period. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 of last year was $264 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues. Based on our expectations for the balance of the year, combined with our performance to the first two quarters, we currently expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.3% of home sale revenues. In the quarter we realized net land sale gains of $1.4 million which compares the gains of $27 million in the comparable prior year period.","I would highlight that last year's gains included $26 million from the sale of two bigger land parcels which generated unusually large profits. I would also note that this year second quarter results include a $4.8 million pre-tax charge related to costs associated with the successful tender for $274 million of our senior notes. This charge is reflected in other expenses on our income statement.","In the second quarter our financial services business generated pre-tax income of $25 million which is an increase of 21% over last year. The gain and pre-tax income for the period was driven by higher volumes as capture rate increased along with higher profitability per loan. For the quarter, mortgage capture rate was 81% up from 76% last year.","Income tax expense for the second quarter was $80 million which represents an effective tax rate of 24.9%, which is generally in line with prior guidance. Last year's reported income tax expense of $85 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 20.8% included $17 million of tax adjustments reported in the period. The adjusted tax rate for Q2, 2018 was 25%. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect our tax rate in the third quarter to be approximately 25.3%.","On the bottom line, the company generated second quarter net income of $241 million or $0.86 per share. In the prior year the company's reported net income was $324 million or $1.12 per share and on an adjusted basis net income last year was $259 million or $0.89 per share.","Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was calculated using approximately 278 million shares, which is a decrease of 9 million or 3% from Q2 of last year. The decrease in share count is due primarily to the company's ongoing share repurchase activities. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million common shares for $83 million for an average price of $31.82 per share. Through the first six months of the year we have repurchased 3.5 million shares for $108 million for an average cost of $30.61 per share.","Inclusive of the $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization that our Board approved this quarter, we had $691 million remaining on our repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter.","Inclusive of our stock and debt purchases during the period we ended the quarter with $659 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 35.1%. Net of our cash on hand our debt-to-capital ratio was 29.1%.","As Ryan also mentioned, we have continued to invest in our business including the American West transaction that we closed during the quarter. In total we paid a $164 million for American West of which $136 million was ascribed to the land we acquired. The balance of the consideration was ascribed to moral homes and the American West trade name.","Looking at our land acquisition activity in the quarter, we invested $473 million in the business which includes $136 million for American West. For the year, we have invested $778 million in land acquisition along with $735 in land development. With a little over $1.5 billion of total land related spend in the first half of the year we are on track to invest approximately $2.9 billion for the year which would be an increase of about 10% over 2018. And finally, at quarter end we controlled approximately 154,000 lots of which approximately 40% are controlled via option.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Bob. As I said at the outset of this call, we experienced a meaningful improvement in our business with year-over-year orders up 7% in the quarter. The increase reflects improved order metrics across many of our markets and specifically looking at conditions across our regions I tell the following.","The eastern third of the country continued to experience good demand with the southeast seeing a nice pickup in buyer activity, while Florida remained one of the top performing areas of the country. In the middle third of the country, Texas remained strong particularly in the Houston and Austin markets, but demand among the higher price points in the Midwest was a little bit slower in the quarter. And at West, Nevada inclusive of the new American West communities as well as our Arizona market enjoyed very strong demand. Business in California remained challenging, but conditions do seem to be stabilizing with buyers beginning to venture back into our communities.","I would note that the improved level of buyer interest experienced in Q2 has carried into the first few weeks of July. The strong economy, low unemployment and falling interest rates continue to support the demand for new homes.","Before opening the call for questions I do want to thank all PulteGroup employees for their tireless efforts to deliver a great home and customer experience to every homebuyer. I'm also proud to say that based on the feedback from our employees, PulteGroup was just certified as a great place to work. This is another important milestone as we work to demonstrate the strength of our corporate culture in an outstanding environment we seek to maintain.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","Jim Zeumer","Thank you, Ryan. We will now open the call to questions in contrary to the operator's comments they are open to all not just financial analysts so that we can speak with as many participants as possible though during the remaining time of the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Chris let's get the Q&A process started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Thanks for taking my questions and nice results.","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Mike.","Mike Dahl","Ryan, I wanted to start out and dig in a little bit more on the active adult commentary. You mentioned that it just seems like it's taking a little bit longer for that buyer segment to rebound. I was hoping you could break it down even just anecdotally if you could between kind of some of the legacy, larger Dell Web projects and some of the kind of newer projects that might have kind of - the smaller footprints, more urban footprints and has there been any notable difference within that segment in terms of performance there?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Mike. Great question and what I would tell you as we highlighted in some of our prepared remarks, we closed out of a number of our communities or suctions of communities that were generating relatively high sales paces. The replacement positions for those selling locations came on a little later in the quarter and had slightly lower sales pace and so the combination of those two things is really what had an impact on the comparative results. I would tell you there's not a differentiation in performance between the in town communities and some of the bigger larger legacy communities. They both perform well and on a relative basis year-over-year are very similar.","More broadly Mike, just to kind of get into the question about the active adult buyer, I would tell you that these buyers are taking a little bit longer to regain some momentum coming out of the back half of last year. The group is, as I think most of you know, is less rate sensitive on both the upswing and the downswing. So the drop in interest rates doesn't have quite the same push that it does for other buyer groups. They frequently pay cash or take very small mortgages. I think it's also a buyer group that tends to be a little bit more cautious and so probably not a total surprise that it's been a tad bit slower than the other buyer groups.","Mike Dahl","That's helpful. And then, I guess conversely had this really nice pickup in the first-time buyer and so I think part of that's clearly been some of the pivot that you've had towards that. But hoping you could elaborate a little more and forgive me if I missed this, but that 30% increase in orders for the first time. Help us understand, how much of that is coming from absorption versus the community count growth you've seen there and any other color you can give us around that? Thanks.","Ryan Marshall","So Mike, I'll start with the absorption question. We had a 14% increase in absorption, so pretty meaningful increase there. Further you've heard us talk over the last really 18 to 24 months that we've been intentionally into that investing in the first time space and we've been bringing assets into our book of business that are specifically targeted for this buyer group, which we think is a meaningful differentiation between doing that which we have done and taking existing assets and simply repurposing them from something they are originally intended for into the first time space.","So, we highlighted on our call last quarter that if you look at the lots that we control that are specifically targeted for the first time buyer group it's about 35% of our controlled book now. So you'll see this segment continue to have a more meaningful presence in our closing volume over time.","So last thing maybe on that point Mike, just I highlighted absorptions were up 14% and community count was up 13%. So those are the two elements that contributed to the overall increase in first time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. I missed if you gave the community count guide, I was curious if you could talk to us about what your expectations are for community count and what the challenges and opportunities are on that metric specifically?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes Stephen, we didn't give a guide, but an answer to your question we expect the community count to be up between 1% and 3% in the third and fourth quarters relative to the prior year period.","In terms of the challenges as you know, it's difficult to open communities, entitlements are challenging today. Our team has done a great job in doing this and obviously that 1% to 3% growth would include the communities that we picked up in the American West transaction.","Stephen Kim","And then, you talked about your land spend and obviously you did a great job in sort of spreading around your cash flow to debt pay down as well as repurchase. But the overall level of land spend, it's a little higher than I would have liked to have seen frankly because I would have liked to have seen your overall land investment on your balance sheet reduced as we go forward. Is this level of land spend what you need to be able to maintain your current rate of growth or do you perceive this level of land investment as a level which is setting you up to accelerate your growth in your home building going forward?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes Stephen, it\u2019s a fair question. In terms of actual spend this year on land in the first three and six months, if you exclude the money we spend for American West we're actually flat. So the increase in spend is largely on development dollars which is bringing lots that we put under control on the path to market. I don't want to get into expectations for growth beyond this year. We've given the guide for what we think it's going to be for the balance of the year.","But, when we look at capital we start with investment in the business. You heard Ryan's commentary on our view of the market, we remain constructive and so this reflects the opportunities that we're seeing in the market including American West. So not really growing as much as I think you're inferring. So we feel comfortable with the level of spend.","Ryan Marshall","Yes Stephen, I would echo Bob's comments and further I would say that we continue to make excellent progress against our goals of three years owned and three years options. Our field teams have just done an outstanding job in working on a local level on a transaction-by-transaction basis to really secure lots that are helping us to turn our assets faster and to minimize the risk that's associated with having too much lined on the balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Lovallo of Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one Bob, it looks like adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales 10.8 was equal to last year's quarter despite the 2% decline in revenue. And also appears that adjusted dollars or SG&A dollars are down on a year-over-year basis.","Can you just help us understand what percentage the moving parts there?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes. It's an interesting question. There is no one thing to highlight as the driver of the performance during the quarter. I think you've heard us talk about that controlling cost is always a focus of ours as we challenge our team all the way back to 2016 when we took a pretty hard look at expenses and we've continued that focus.","So, really it was a cross of bunch of different areas, there's no unique or significant things happening in the quarter.","John Lovallo","Okay, that's helpful. And then Ryan, you mentioned not seeing any signs of another pending slow down like in the second half of '18 but I just curious in hindsight what signs did you guys see heading into the back half of last year and what are you looking for?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, it's a good question. And then if you'll remember in our second quarter earnings call last year, we highlighted that we started to see some softening, was really in about the third week of April, and for us we saw it really in two forms, really would see it in two forms, the traffic that crosses the threshold of our model homes is certainly one of the leading indicators.","Website traffic tends to be a little less predictive but certainly another metric. And then, on a daily basis we can see the number of new contracts that reported from our sales offices and that's arguably the proof in the pudding and the best indicator of an impending slowdown.","As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, the first couple of weeks of July, the momentum that we have experienced in Q2 has sustained, we're still seeing very positive trends from buyers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner","Hey guys, good morning, nice quarter.","Ryan Marshall","Hi, Alan.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thanks, Alan.","Alan Ratner","Ryan, I think you were talking a little bit about just the fourth quarter and building up some specs during that software demand period and obviously I think a lot of builders did the same thing and retrospect it, it turned out to be a decent decision because the sales environment improved.","If you look at the start status so far year-to-date it's definitely lagged orders and I think a lot of that points to in absorption of a lot of that standing speck that was on the ground heading into the year.","So, my first question is can you talk a little bit about what the inventory situation looks like in your markets today both yours as well as probably more importantly other builders. And the second question on that point is just costs have remained in check here and I think a lot of that has to deal with the labor situation maybe not being quite as bad up to this point given that standing inventory.","Is there any risk now that the orders are improving that you start to hear more about the labor tightness and challenges that the industry has faced over the first few years of this recovery?","Ryan Marshall","Sure, Alan. I'll take the question on inventory and then I'll have Bob address your question on costs. As far as inventory goes at your point, the back half of last year we made the decision to let our spec inventory run a little bit higher than what we typically do.","And that was purely aimed at maintaining the momentum of our production machine. At the end of the fourth quarter, our specs is a percentage total inventory was about 31%, actually a little higher than that, that's probably [30%, 33%] I think at the end of the fourth quarter.","We saw that come back down in the first quarter and we're now back down to 26% which is more in line with where we typically run. That's total spec inventory at all stages of construction. And then, when you specifically look at final inventory, we continue to be at less than one per final unit, per active community which is the kind of the parameter that we've typically targeted.","So, as far as our inventory levels go, Alan, we think we're in great shape. We continue to start homes very much in line with our expectations and so we haven\u2019t necessarily experienced within our business the same situation that I think you described in the overall [starts] data.","As far as inventory goes in the broader market, I think it's in a healthy spot when we look at month of supply for both new homes as well as for resale, almost every single market that we operate in remains at a healthy level. Certainly, we've seen some markets take some increases but even with those increases we believe the levels are still at a healthy spot.","There are a few competitors that have put more inventory into the ground in an effort to achieve stated closing goals for the year. We are managing against that and competing against that on a case-by-case basis where we run into that. But it hasn\u2019t had a system-wide impact on our businesses; I think it's evidenced by our Q2 results.","Alan Ratner","Great, that's very --.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","And Alan, sorry just I wanted to address the comment or the question about costs. I think you asked about labor specifically how broadened, let's talk about our cost in general.","The pleasing news is that lumber has trended down, I think everybody is well aware of that. Based on that and generally benign cost environment, we had guided to a 2% increase in our vertical construction cost and we now see it at about 1% for the year. So, the benefit of that lower lumber cost has really come through.","The only sort of out-layered to that really is concrete very specific, locally we've seen some pricing pressure there. As it relates to labor, I would characterize that it's still generally pretty tight but not as bad as it has been. So, to your question, we've actually seen some moderation in the pricing pressure.","Pricing isn\u2019t going backwards but certainly less upward pressure than there has been and in certain markets we've actually had trades come in and ask looking for work which I think is a good sign in terms of pricing.","So, in general, the labor market feels that is because it has. And I think with that there's room for them to do more as evidenced by the fact that we've seen some folks looking for work.","Alan Ratner","Got it, that's really encouraging to hear. If I could ask one more, Ryan, just few builders recently have started talking a little bit about single-family rental and either building for operators where you are kind of either bulk selling and some communities or even phases of projects entirely for single-family rental operators.","Was curious if you guys have pursued that at all if it's any part of your business today or if there's any thought about embarking on that going forward?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Alan, it's not. We have looked at it, we have evaluated it in an environment where it's becoming increasingly more difficult to find well located land, get it in title, develop, etcetera, and we don\u2019t believe that that's the highest in best use of the associated land parcels.","We think we're better off putting that available land into our for sale operation. So, other than some small onesie-twosies here and there and specific markets as we close to other communities, that's not a business that we're engaged in.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about pricing power in this environment. I guess Ryan, I guess if interest rates have come down obviously, have you found that\u2019s all kind of allowed you to perhaps I guess stimulate price increases.","What are you seeing I guess on pricing power today versus eight months ago across the different buyer segments?","Ryan Marshall","Yes. So, we've had in specific locations we have had the opportunity to raise prices a bit but on the -- I would tell you that's the minority. The majority of our communities have frankly kind of held -- been held flat. It is still a competitive market, the incentives are still elevated.","We continue to make decisions on a community-by-community basis to adjust pace a price in such a way that we think we think we can drive the best outcome for our shareholders and drive the highest return on invested capital and I think you are seeing that in our results.","So, with interest rates coming down, it was widely talked about the back half of last year that one of the biggest headwinds that we had was overall affordability. Interest rates are certainly contributing to that, as we've seen interest rates come back down along with some stabilization in overall pricing. I think that's helped to bring affordability in a lot of markets back in line.","Matthew Bouley","Okay, I appreciate that. And then I guess, you mentioned incentives, looking at the third quarter margin guide, I think Bob said you said discounts were down 10 basis points sequentially in the quarter.","Is there way to quantify what that looks like on orders is I mean Ryan you just mentioned incentives are still elevated but is there any reason to believe at least that sequentially that the discounts on closing shouldn't continue to diminish further in the second half. Thank you.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, I'd rather not -- it's Bob. I'd rather not get into the specific what's base pricing, what's option pricing. We feel pretty good about the market. Obviously, we work to maintain the margins that we have, we have among the highest in the industry.","We're pushing opportunity for pricing and that comes in lot premiums and option revenues. And then, we're working to make sure we're turning our assets and we'll use discounting to get there. So, the relative percentages of each of those move over time a little bit.","I think the message we want you to hear is that there are still instances in the market and to the question earlier about inventory. There is inventory in the market and we're competing with that to try and turn our assets and we'll continue to do so. It's the reason you saw it move up year-over-year, a little less so first quarter, second quarter.","Also important to remember, we are more built to order, so you won't see the impact of today's discounts in our closings for probably a quarter or two.","Operator","Our next question comes from Truman Patterson of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions and nice results.","Ryan Marshall","Thank you.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Good morning, Truman.","Truman Patterson","First wanted to dig in, yes, I wanted to dig in on your the main commentary, you said June and July it seems like lower interest rates kept the selling season elongated if you will. In the first quarter you guys noted that the traffic that can to order conversion was a bit low I guess on the second quarter.","And has that conversion improved? And what I'm trying to dig at was the second quarter order results was it really driven by better traffic or better conversion?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Truman, its Ryan. So, what we have seen in the second quarters, we've seen an increase in traffic that combined with higher community count has led to higher gross sales and also higher absorption rates but I would not attribute it to higher conversion rate in the quarter.","Truman Patterson","Okay great, thanks guys. Looking at your cash balance currently about $660 million, what level are you guys comfortable with and could you guys discuss your capital allocation strategy moving forward and if you don\u2019t mind, if I could piggy back off of Stephen's question earlier, how should we think about your [demand] strategy over the next couple of years especially when you overlay this with how you guys think demand is going to shape up?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Sure. We have a lot of liquidity, $600+ million of cash; the billion dollar revolver has about $750 million of availability on top of that. So, liquidity is really strong for us. I wouldn\u2019t want to put an artificial number around it, I think it would depend on what we're spending the money on.","Obviously, if we had need for increased liquidity, we could go to the capital market. So, really no target number for cash. And as it relates to how we're going to invest it, I'd point you right back to what we've been telling you for years now which is first in the business.","We're going to pay a dividend, we increased it by 20% at the beginning of this year. We would buy back stock with the balance and we've been talking about, we might also look at our leverages, so as act on that in this quarter. I think you can and should expect to see us continue to do exactly that, in exactly that order of priority going forward.","We're fortunate the business is cash accretive and we're generating cash strong cash flows even this quarter once again cash flow from operation's positive. So, as it relates to our land strategy over years, I think, I'll refer you back to the first answer which was, we want to invest in the business as long as we are constructive on it. We want to grow with or slightly in advance of the market. We will invest to try and do that. You heard Ryan talk earlier a little bit about how we're doing that as we're building the optionality in our book which provides capital efficiency, greater liquidity.","So until you hear us start to say there's something about the market that's causing us to either moderate or reduce our land spend that's where I think you'll see us put the majority of our capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Your line is open.","Carl Reichardt","Bob, I wanted to ask about the community count guide. You've got 1% to 3% I think each quarter for the rest of the year, but your first-time buyer communities were up 14% this quarter. So as you look out for the rest of the year, are you expecting a more significant acceleration in certain price point or certain geography in terms of store count especially with the active adult being sort of lagging here and you getting those stores open late?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Well, I don't want to get too granular on that. It becomes a quagmire right.","Carl Reichardt","You opened the door, Bob.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","I did, I did. So I would offer that we also had community count growth in the active adult space in this quarter just like we did in the first-time and actually we had a decrease in move-up. I don't think you should expect to see a meaningful change in the business. We did highlight that we would expect the first-time business to be growing based on the sales that we reported. We'll see a little bit of moderation in pricing related to that. Over time I think it's fair to say we've highlighted that we want to get to a little bit closer to 35% of the business in the first-time space.","Our land bank today is 37% targeted towards that buyer. That's typically going to have community count associated with it. So I think you'll see our community count move in line with the dialogue we've had over the last two, three years in terms of where we have our investment going and what demographic it's targeting.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks and Ryan, could you talk maybe a little bit about two things; one is the private builder acquisition environment. What it might look like if things have changed in the last six months?","And then also just the availability of lot options and whether or not we're starting to see developers return to the business in more meaningful numbers as you look to continue to move your mix sort of gradually towards the option site? Thanks.","Ryan Marshall","Yes Carl thanks for the question. In terms of the private builder market, I would tell you it's been fairly consistent. There are opportunities out there in various markets. I think given our size and our geographic footprint we tend to get a look at a lot of them. We're not necessarily interested in all of them because I think what you heard from both me and Bob is, we're looking for acquisitions to be aligned with our overall strategy and we're going to continue to be very disciplined along those lines.","The Vegas acquisition was one that fit very well with our strategy with how we were trying to position our business and as well as we were able to structure the acquisition such that it also aligned with what we've been trying to do with our land book and with our balance sheet and we'll continue to do that.","So as far as, I forgot what the second part was. Are we seeing more developers in the market? Not really. I think it remains a very tough space to see new entrants come in to. So I think you've got certain markets where they're well capitalized developers and they continue to develop land for us. But we're not seeing a wholesale return of developers that went away in the prior downturn and the real constraint there, banks just aren't willing to lend. And so without capital and access to capital is pretty tough for that group to come back into the space.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding the puts and takes to the gross margin guidance in the back half. Bob you referred to the benefits, some of the benefits from lower lumbar impacting your overall construction cost inflation outlook positively. I guess, you're still looking at a down year-over-year dynamic for the second half, but I just wanted to try and get a sense if that was more driven by the higher incentives or land cost inflation combined with other cost inflation because I guess the incentives aren't peeling off maybe as quickly as some had hoped for as this better environment so far this year has played out relative to the back half?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes. Mike, I think you got it right. It's all those things candidly. We obviously enjoy like I said earlier among it's not the highest margins of the space. We're proud of it. We're protective of it, but house costs are going up. The tariffs while not significant are impactful. Our land costs are up. We are cycling through land very quickly about three years on average.","The option we have built into our book does introduce some cost to that and as Ryan talked about pricing while we take opportunities where we have them, there are discounts in the market and we are playing these. We want to turn our assets we are going to continue that rotation of the asset base. So like I said, it's a pretty healthy world we are living in. We got some cost pressure and we think we are going hold to serve, we think that's pretty good.","Michael Rehaut","I appreciate that. I guess secondly, you referred to earlier in the call in terms of your order growth cadence throughout 2Q that April was slow year-over-year and obviously then things kicked in more strongly in May and June. I was just hoping to get a little bit more granularity in terms of the degree of magnitude there. Was April actually down year-over-year, was May and June up over 10% through low double-digits and obviously rates came down, but most builders kind of really didn't point to rate being a driver per se in May and particular given the fact that mortgage rates really didn't even decline in May materially relative to the ten year.","So I was wondering what the drivers were, either certain geographic regions sort of markets or certain product segments. So again kind of a two part, one little more granular on the degree of magnitude of the improvements, and then what the drivers were there? Thanks.","Ryan Marshall","Mike, so the comment was that on a year-over-year basis April was a bit slower and as I touched on in one of my earlier answers, April was really the last kind of strong month in 2018. So I think the year-over-year comp was probably a little bit more difficult. In terms of the other things that I\u2019d probably offer, the Easter holiday was where the sale had a little bit of an impact in terms of kind of April overall numbers, but I think that all kind of comes out of the wash as you move through the quarter.","Seasonality, I would suggest is fairly normal. Little bit better than last year. So we like the way the business is performing. We like what we are seeing. We saw coming out of April which was a fine month. It just was against a comp from last year. It was little tougher. We had a nice May. We had a nice June and the strength has continued into July.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko","Good morning. Bigger picture question. As you move thinking through the mix and you move from say 27 to 30 onto that 35 first-time. Conventional wisdom is that the lower price point, the first-time homes are inherently lower margin I mean, your first-time is a bit different. But as we think about past 3Q, 4Q into next year and beyond, can you sustain margins all else equal on product set I guess the better way to ask it is, is your first-time margin comparable to move-up, comparable to active adult and where does that 35% share take from any other categories in that margin discussion?","Ryan Marshall","Jack its Ryan. Good morning. I appreciate the question. I think what you have heard from us in the past is, we don't underwrite the gross margin. We are underwriting to return and we are positioning our overall book of business in a way that we think we derive the optimal net result by playing in certain geographies and playing against certain consumer groups that gives us the best opportunity to manage risk and have success.","I think conventional wisdom to your point would tell you that the first-time space typically comes with a little bit lower margin, the volumes and the inventory turns tend to run a little bit higher which gives you a comparable return as the other segments have a little bit higher gross margins. So we have kind of provided the guide for the full year of this year and you have heard Bob talk about all the puts and takes around what we are expecting in terms of cost increases and where we have got cost pressures, where we have got some tailwinds and what the resulting margin is and you can see that we are still maintaining the best margins in the space.","We are very pleased with where we have been able to keep our margins and that is reflective of more business coming through the first-time space. As we get closer to Q4 of this year and get into next year, we will update our guide for 2020 at the appropriate time.","Jack Micenko","And then, the mortgage capture rate you called it out, it jumped pretty significantly year-over-year. Is that market conditions and execution in gain on sale getting better or was that partially a component of maybe trying to drive some of the slower demand activity in the back half over the finish line in more recent quarters?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","No, actually it's a concerted effort on our part. Our operators have done a great job as our mortgage company of identifying the divisions where we didn't achieve real success with our capture rate and trying to figure out what caused it. So we're trying to make sure our incentive structures are right so that we drive folks to the mortgage company because what we know is, they serve as a captive model. They do a great job serving only us as a builder and their customer satisfaction scores and net promoter scores are off the charts and so we think it's actually a better experience for our consumers at the same time.","What you saw last year was, it was a very, very competitive market. The new money origination had become something that the banks were paying a lot of attention to. As rates go down and re-fi business comes up it softens that a little bit. I wouldn't say it was a lot. So this is really about us focusing on how are we providing that opportunity to the consumer showing them the benefits of working with our mortgage company driving higher capture rate. So it was mostly internal effort.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay McCanless of Wedbush, your line is open.","Jay McCanless","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. The first question I had, the order decline that you saw in the Midwest was that related to any weather issues or delays in getting communities open because of the weather?","Ryan Marshall","Not really Jay, the weather to your point was tough and it certainly has an impact, but we wouldn't want to hang the specific result in the Midwest on weather. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks we just saw the higher price points of our move-up communities which we have quite a few of in the Midwest. We're a little bit softer.","Jay McCanless","And then, on the active adult in terms of pricing, do you guys feel like you need to adjust some pricing there or is this just kind of a temporary blip in demand?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, I don't think we need to adjust that. You heard Ryan talk about that that is generally a cautious buyer group noise in the marketplace, kind of puts them back a little bit. It's not about interest rates for them. The other thing that I\u2019d highlight is it's also a consumer that buys what they want. They've got the healthiest balance sheet of any of our consumer groups and they're willing to pay for the things that are important to them. So we haven't seen a real need to try and address the pricing there. Traffic is up. I think at the end of the day it just needs they to get their head in the right space and they'll be back in the market.","Jay McCanless","Got it, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","We have run out of time for questions and answers today. I'll now return the call to Mr. Zeumer.","Jim Zeumer","Thank you. Appreciate your time this morning and certainly be available the remainder of the day if you have any follow-up questions and we look forward to speak with you on the next call."],"18071":["PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 23, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James P.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our third quarter financial results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2014. On the call today to discuss PulteGroup's results are Richard Dugas, Chairman and President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Ossowski, Vice President and Financing Controller. Before we begin, I want to alert all participants that copies of this morning's earnings release along with presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com.","Also posted to the website is the second release we issued this morning announcing a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend and the $750 million increase in our share repurchase authorization. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to the website a little later. Please note that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. This risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now with that said, I like to turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I am once again very pleased with the strong earnings and operating results PulteGroup reported this morning. A 29% increase in year-over-year pretax income and bottom line earnings of $0.37 per share reflect our relentless pursuit of operational improvement. We continue to work on a series of key initiatives, which are improving our fundamental business metrics in support of driving better long-term returns on invested capital.","In a few minutes, Bob will review the details of our third quarter results, which demonstrate the operating and financial progress we continue to make against our goals. I'd like to take some time on this call to discuss the other release we issued this morning on dividends and share repurchases. For the past several years, you've heard us talk about our Value Creation strategy and our focus on driving better margins, overhead leverage and inventory turns. If you have been monitoring our results, you can see PulteGroup's relative performance on these metrics go from middle of the pack or even bottom in certain instances to among the industry leaders. The work we've done these past few years has clearly driven meaningful company-specific gains beyond any market lift the industry has realized since the housing recovery started in 2011. The critical next stage, which investors have been asking about, has been on the company's plans for future capital allocation. Beyond the more than $1 billion of cash we carry and related very strong balance sheet, investors see our operations continuing to grow more profitable and more capital efficient. These trends and the fact that PulteGroup won't be a cash taxpayer for several years, point to the potential for continued strong cash flow generation going forward.","Based on these facts and trends the time is right for us to better define our capital allocation plans for the future. We will discuss these plans in much greater detail at our December 9 Investor Day here in Atlanta, but the basic components are as follows. First, to invest in the business to drive higher return on invested capital. Next we have increased our quarterly dividend to enhance the cumulative returns of our shareholders and finally, going forward, we plan to return available excess capital to shareholders routinely and systematically through share repurchase activity.","Looking at our investment philosophy, you may recall that prior to implementing our Value Creation strategy we allocated capital almost exclusively into the business to acquire the land needed to support aggressive growth. We got the volumes about our expensive and heavy land pipeline hindered returns on invested capital and created outsized market risk. Among the many lessons learned from the last housing boom is that there are paces and rates at which you can effectively grow this business while still generating high returns. Exceeding those rates for multiple years in a row put significant stress on a company and can encourage an organization to take on excessive risk.","We believe shareholders are not well served by doing either. So today, having fixed our balance sheet and improved our overall returns on invested capital to be above our cost of capital, it make sense to continue to increase our investment in land. In 2013, we invested $1.3 billion into land acquisition and development, which is an increase of 30% over 2012. In 2014, land investment will likely be up another 40% or more over 2013. And given our expectations for a sustained albeit gradual recovery in housing demand, we have authorized a land spend budget for 2015 of $2.4 billion. This is an increase of $600 million to $700 million of our expected 2014 expenditures for land acquisition and development.","Notwithstanding our positive outlook on the market, we are steadfast in our view that we need to remain balanced and return funds to shareholders over the cycle. Having established the level of investment we want to pursue, we consider the form and size of the routine systematic returns of funds for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This morning's announcement of a 60% increase in our dividend and a $750 million expansion of our share repurchase authorization is a direct reflection of this discipline.","We've said from the start of the housing recovery that we expected a slow, measured improvement in buyer demand that would play out over a number of years. We have probably been more right than wrong in this forecast. Our forecast which we continue to support and now we are articulating our plans for capital usage throughout the cycle. From a demand perspective, I am pleased with what we saw over the course of the third quarter, as absorption paces improved for the third quarter on a row and our expectations are for sustained growth and demand going forward.","We will, however, keep a watchful eye on the issues ranging from recent stock market volatility and interest rate fears, to fighting in the Middle East and health concerns developing in the U.S. to see if they impact consumer confidence going forward. More broadly, our view of the U.S. market remains positive, as continued improvements in both the economy and employment provide ongoing support to an industry that continues to benefit from low inventory, low-mortgage rates and favorable demographic trends. Further, we are encouraged by proposed changes at FHFA, which have the potential to improve mortgage availability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Regardless of how the macro environment evolves, I feel really good about where we are as a company and how we're running the business. With the 134,000 lots under control, $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a gross debt-to-cap ratio of 28% and a disciplined capital investment process, we are in a great position to further improve our returns and the returns we generate for our shareholders.","I think it's important to stop here and thank the employees of PulteGroup, who have been instrumental in putting us in such a strong position. Their efforts have allowed us to successfully execute our long-term plans while delivering the day-to-day actions needed to run this business. They are an amazing group of people. With that said, let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on the quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. The 2 press releases we issued today, demonstrate the ongoing benefits we're realizing by operating our business in alignment with our long-term Value Creation strategy. As Richard indicated, we realized strong year-over-year gains across a number of critical areas in the business. Before I get to the details, let me remind everyone that as we highlighted in this morning earnings release, we acquired certain real estate assets from Dominion Homes in August. In connection with this transaction, we gain control of 8,200 lots in the Columbus, Louisville and Lexington markets and assumed 622 Dominion Homes in our backlog.","During our 5 weeks of ownership, these assets contributed 64 sign ups and 86 closings from 33 active communities. Looking at our income statement, home sale revenues in the third quarter increased 4% over the prior year to $1.6 billion. Our higher revenues were driven by an 8% or $24,000 increase in our average selling price to $334,000, partially offset by a 4% decrease in closing volumes to 4,646 homes. The increase in average selling price was driven by an 11% increase in ASP to $410,000 in our Pulte communities, and a 6% increase in ASP to $322,000 in our Del Webb communities. The average selling price of $204,000 in our Centex communities was essentially unchanged from the prior year. Our mix of closings by brand was consistent with the third quarter of last year, with 46% coming from our Pulte communities, 30% from Del Webb and 24% from Centex.","Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was 22.9%, which is an increase of 200 basis points over the third quarter of last year. Our margins continue to benefit from higher average selling prices, lower interest costs and gains from our strategic pricing programs, which focus on maximizing revenue opportunities within lot premiums and home options. Lot premiums in the third quarter increased to 11% or approximately $1,200 over last year, while option revenues per closing increased 15% or approximately $6,500 versus last year. There's been a lot of market commentary relating to the potential for the industry's increasing use of incentives in certain markets. I'm pleased to note that we have not seen significant pressure to increase incentives in the majority of our markets. In fact, sales discounts in the quarter actually fell by 8% to just under $5,700 or 1.7% per house. We know there's a lot of focus on gross margins and while our margins are up 200 basis points compared to last year, we recognized that they're down 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Approximately 30 basis points of the decrease was driven by closings from Dominion's backlog, which carry very low margins because of acquisition accounting adjustments. The remaining decrease in sequential margins is due primarily to unexpected costs associated with the closeout of certain legacy communities, and a modest unfavorable shift in the mix of homes delivered compared to the second quarter, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense.","It should be noted, that closing out the remainder of the Dominion backlog will continue to weigh on our reported margins for at least the next 2 quarters. The margin impact could be in the range of 50 to 100 basis points each quarter depending upon the volume and mix of units closed in each period.","Beyond these short-term impacts, we continue to realize efficiency in sales pace benefits with commonly manage plans, which accounted for 45% of deliveries in the third quarter. The closing volume from commonly managed plans is up from 39% in Q2 of this year and we're now slightly higher than our year-end target of 40% for 2014.","SG&A costs for the third quarter were $147 million or 9.5% of home sale revenues compared with a $139 million or 9.3% in the third quarter of last year. At $147 million, SG&A expenses for the period are consistent with previous guidance. Financial services reported pretax income of $11 million for the quarter, which is comparable with last year's results. Capture rate for the period was 80%, which is unchanged from last year and consistent with the first half of this year.","For the third quarter, Pulte reported pretax income of $225 million, which is up $50 million or 29% over the $175 million of pretax income reported last year. Our income tax expense for the period was $84 million, which equates to an effective tax rate of 38%. In the third quarter of 2013, we reported a tax benefit of $2.1 billion relating to the reversal of substantially all of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.","Net income for the third quarter was $141 million or $0.37 per share. Last year's DTA reversal makes the EPS comparison hard to assess, but given the 29% increase in pretax income, we're extremely pleased with the progress we continue to realize in our financial results. Looking beyond the income statement, we had 6,865 homes under construction, of which 18% were spec at the end of the quarter. As a percentage of construction activity, this is consistent with prior year, and our finish spec inventory totaled only 335 homes, which remains well below 1 per community.","During the quarter, we put 16,165 lots under control, half of which are related to the purchase from Dominion. Our third quarter investment of $525 million brings our total year-to-date land acquisition and development spend to $1.25 billion. As occurred last year, it's likely that we will not get our entire authorized spend targeted at $2 billion for 2014 invested this year and that will -- we will be closer to $1.8 billion for the year. This would represent a 40% increase in investment over 2013. And as Richard commented, our land acquisition and development investment authorization for 2015 has been set at $2.4 billion. I would point out the development and entitlement delays continue to grow more pronounced, which is impacting our ability to get money invested. Having said that, we want our divisions to remain disciplined and not force investment into the system by reaching for deals or taking on incremental risk just to get a contract signed. While deals are taking longer, the profile of the projects we put under contract has not changed.","Consistent with our recent quarterly updates, roughly 75% of the transactions we entered into during the quarter are raw, which means additional time and dollars will be required to bring the communities online. We also continue to see the best return opportunities in projects targeted toward move up and active adult buyers. So the lion share of our investment was targeted toward these consumer segments.","At the end of the quarter, we had 134,000 lots under control, of which 36,000 or 27% were controlled via auction. We continue to look for opportunities to auction rather than own assets, where such a structure allows us to enhance returns and or reduce risk. Of the 134,000 lots under control, approximately 23% are finished.","During the quarter, we also paid a $0.05 per share dividend and repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock for $50.3 million or $18.85 per share, in addition to the investment in the business. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since reactivating the program in July of 2013 to 14.9 million shares or 4% of our shares outstanding for $266 million or $17.82 per share. Even after having spent more than $600 million during the quarter on investment and return to shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash. We recognized that having $1.2 billion nonreturning asset is not advantageous. Today's announcement about our dividend and share repurchase authorization, in addition to stepping up our land investment in 2015 demonstrate our commitment to putting this capital to appropriate use.","Moving on to sales activity, the dollar value signups in the quarter increased 3% over last year to $1.3 billion. While net new orders were essentially unchanged at 3,779 homes. Signups increased 8% at Pulte and decreased to 11% and 3% at Centex and Del Webb respectively.","Aggregate absorption paces were flat during the quarter. However, if you exclude the 5-week impact of the Dominion assets, absorption paces were up 5% overall. Looking at this by brand, Centex and Del Webb communities increased 8% and 23% respectively, offset by a decrease of 4% in our Pulte communities. It's worth noting that our Del Webb community count was impacted by the close out of several selling positions since last year. Regardless, we're pleased by the stronger paces we continue to see within this brand. The ongoing improvement in our Centex communities continues to be an encouraging sign in terms of potential future demand.","We finished the third quarter with 600 communities, which is comparable to last year's 604 communities. And we ended Q3 with a backlog of 7,934 homes valued at $2.6 billion, which is up from 7,522 homes valued at $2.4 billion last year. Now, let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. We were generally pleased with the overall level of demand experienced in the third quarter, but depending on the market, we did see a little more volatility from week-to-week. On the East Coast, we continue to see stronger demand in the southern markets and particularly in Florida and the Carolinas. The DC area showed some improvement as the quarter progressed. But demand conditions remained below expectations as you move further north of the Coast. Third quarter demand in the Midwest were generally positive, with ongoing strengthen in Michigan, Indianapolis and Cleveland. We're excited about the opportunities we see to improve the operating results we realized from the Dominion assets along with building out our position in these markets going forward. We have a strong experience team in place, so I am confident about the execution.","Texas remains one of the strongest areas of the country, but we did see the market starting to ease a little from the torrid pace they have been setting. Out West, Southern California, Las Vegas and Phoenix picked up in the quarter, which is a positive sign. Northern California was little more volatile from month-to-month. Demand through the first few weeks of October has followed the usual seasonal pattern, with some uptick coming out of September, but with a little less consistency from market-to-market driven by local market dynamics. What we're also seeing from market-to-market is varying degrees of strain on the local trade basis, which are at times struggling to keep up with the current pace of production. It is likely that tight labor resources will create production challenges in the industry for the foreseeable future.","In closing, I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. Taken together, I think this morning's 2 releases say a lot about the company and the strategies we are executing against. You see continued strong operating and financial performance supported by a more disciplined capital investment process working together to drive improve returns for our shareholders.","I look forward to seeing you at the December investor meeting, where we can discuss these topics in greater detail. Thanks for your time this morning, and now I'll turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.","James P. Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Richard. Before opening the call to questions, I do want to alert that -- investors that registration to attend our December 9, Investor Day, will open up Monday October 27. We will issue an email announcing the online registration is active and as space is limited, I'd encourage interested investors to sign up promptly. Now we'll open up the call for questions, so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan if you will explain the Q&A process, we will get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I really like what you're doing on the capital allocation side and could you talk more about that the decision process that you went through the criteria that you're looking at when you do it, what you think about the future capital allocation? How you look at the cap structure throughout the cycle just sort of the whole process that you went through?","Richard J. Dugas","Sure Stephen, this is Richard. I'll make some comments and then Bob can take you through a little bit more about how we're looking at the balance sheet. We've studied this very carefully, frankly over several years. And had really I think done our homework with regard to the entire housing cycle over a long history and frankly what we believe is that returning funds to shareholders through a very disciplined manner overtime is the best path toward total shareholder return and value creation for shareholders. So what you see is a little more formalized pronouncement of our strategy. We've obviously been operating the business with a view toward high returns for several years now, and the results I think are evident. Now we're just trying to be a little more explicit about additional return of funds to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase activity. So that's how we looked at it and our December 9, Investor Day, is going to get into frankly a lot more history and detail on how we came about these ideas, but maybe Bob you could explain a little bit about the balance sheet and what we're looking at there and then cash.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Sure. We -- as we look at this -- we -- it will hinge off of leverage to a certain extent. So you heard us talk about in the past that we want to or we're comfortable with 40% leverage. You can expect us now to target leverage between 30% and 40%. That's not a hard-and-fast rule if there's a particular transaction that makes sense we might go above or below that, but the guiding post for us will be 30% to 40% leverage overtime. And so then as we looked at it the first priority is always what are we going to invest in the business. You heard our commentary on what we're going to do for 2015. The goal obviously being to drive higher returns. So now that we've-- are actually earning above our weighted average cost of capital, we'd like to improve that, so returns have be accretive to that on investment in the business. At the same time, we want to be balanced. We talked about this too. The dividend, I think you can expect us to target a yield between 2% and 3% overtime. It will be important to us that we have the confidence that we can deliver that through cycle. So we've started I think the yield based on yesterday's close with about 1.7%. So if the market is feeling good, it's always subject to Board approval, but you can expect to see us increase that 2% to 3% overtime. We always want to be cognizant that M&A activity is available to us and we still look at it as land transactions, so Dominion is a very good example of that. And then what we'll do is as we look at our projected cash flows, capital structure again, targeted 30% to 40% leverage ratios, if we have money available beyond that in any period of time, we would seek to buy back stock with that. It's important to note that we're not actually looking to time the market on that. So you would see us put plans in place that are meant to do that ratably over a period of time. Those plans will be reactive to market pricing, so if there's dislocation I think we'd accelerate somewhat, but again it's not designed to say we're making a call on the equity value today. It's we're returning shareholders to -- money systematically and routinely as Richard said.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I really like the plan that you all are laying out on that. And just to follow along on the land spend side, you started ramping up your spend, you're still sort of in a catch-up mode if you will as far as getting new communities open as the others burn off. As you look at the $2.4 billion for next year what type of gross community count do you expect and how is that compared, what you think will be rolling off?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Steve, this is Richard. We're going to give some guidance on that number at our Q4 call as our budgeting process is kind of underway now. I think it's fair to say the increased investment at some point in time will yield community count growth, but we're not prepared to kind of get into that today, as we're still finalizing the numbers for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Bob, the margin guidance this piece of Dominion is 50 to 100 each quarter, is that incremental or is that also sort of the run rate, how do we think about that next couple of quarters?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, so what that does is it incorporates. We assumed 622 homes in their backlog, which because of acquisition accounting will be ascribed very low margins. We're just saying that mix of business in our total will drive our margins on an aggregate basis down between 50 and 100 basis points.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Richard you said in October there was some volatility region-to-region, can you talk about maybe -- where maybe demand was little better versus maybe a little not as good?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Jack, we're not going to comment on specifics with regard to October, but it's candidly not a lot different than we saw in Q3. If you noted in our release, Florida was particularly strong, the Midwest was a good market for us. We saw some improving conditions in the Southwest and then a little bit weaker versus frankly probably unsustainable pace in Texas in the quarter, and then Northern California started to show a little bit more volatility. So what we're trying to indicate about October was that we saw a typical seasonal uptick coming out of September, but we do see some volatility week-to-week just based on all the world events.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions conceptually for you since you've gone through this exercise on returning of capital. Your 30% to 40% net leverage target, you're going to have confidence in that after you book second quarter backlog assuming it converts, so that assumes always a back half biased to share buybacks?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Ken, just one comment, it's a 30% to 40% gross leverage. It's not net, just FYI. You said net.","Richard J. Dugas","And candidly the seasonality within the businesses doesn't impact our leverage ratios much or at all.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, when you think about yield, that's yield to your current stock or that's what you value your own company at intrinsically?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","It would be to current value. And we recognize that there's volatility. If we had made this announcement 1.5 week ago, and the price was $17, the yield would have been higher. So again it's -- we're thinking of this through cycle. Obviously, our belief in our forward cash generation will help to drive what we do. And if it turns out that its 1.9% yield or 2.7% yield is less important to us than the consistency and being able to deliver it through cycle.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, and Ken, this is Richard. Just if I could illuminate on that just for a second, the goal here is to signal very clearly and deliberately that we want to be balanced in capital through cycle. And we're making a deliberate statement to suggest that our first priority is in the business, but at high returns. And to the extent that annually we have left over funds, which clearly we think will have a capacity for strong cash flow generation, a combination of dividends and repurchases we think is the best bet for shareholders over the long run.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. And I guess if I could ask for your comment just briefly on the news last week with the agencies and the SEC, the rulings about, if qualified residential mortgages, what are the factors that you're going to look at over the next month that you think are most indicative if in fact that's delivering higher demand?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Well, with regard to what's happening with FHFA right now, Mr. Watt's comments earlier this week certainly leave us encouraged. There's always a path between announcement and implementation, so we have to watch to see what ultimately gets implemented. But we have said for some time that mortgage availability is tight in the industry and we believe any clarity that can be brought with regard to how government loans are going to be treated is important for banks to want to underwrite. And we've heard that again and again from folks at Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and others, so we believe what we've heard is the right step. And I think it's important that the administration has recognized that housing is not as big a driver in the economy as it could be, partly due to credit being a little bit tighter than is necessary. So we're watchful, we're cautious, we're not certainly predicting that anything dramatic changes here, but overtime, if some of these ideas get put into practice, it certainly has the potential to affect activity, particularly for that entry-level category. And I think we've all talked about for a couple of years now that that segment has been underrepresented in the recovery and if it gets going housing could get exciting again. So our view is that it's a positive statement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Desi filling in for Bob. Just speaking on that topic, maybe a little further along there, do you think the easing of credit standards could be -- maybe what gets us from 1 million starts today to 1.2 million to 1.3 million starts or is it more of smaller incremental upside from where we're at?","Richard J. Dugas","That's a really tough question to answer. Candidly, I don't know. I do think it's important to recognize that. A combination of factors will go into this. Number one will be the actual easing of credit to the extent it eases. And number two will be the press that goes around it that suggest to buyers that today could actually get credit that are not applying, to apply. There's certainly some evidence that people think that credit is tighter than it actually is. So a combination of people that are maybe a little bit uneducated with regard to credit today could get in the market along with some actual easing could help us we believe. But in terms of exactly what impact it is in terms of starts are, I don't know how to quantify that at this point.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then on just to give little clarity on the community count absorption pace that you talked about. In the absence of the acquisition of Dominion Homes, would your community kind of have been lowered year-over-year? I'm just trying to square the fact that orders were relatively stable with absorption pace at 5% and community count flat.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, so what happened is we bought it. We have 33 active communities that came online in August and contributed some signup activity. But if you think of retail with same store concept, in our 600 ending communities, are 33 communities from there, so to directly to your question, we would have had 567 communities if we hadn't purchased Dominion. And our pace assumptions, so we've talked about a 5% pace increase. What it does is it takes the 33 out of our ending community count and then takes the signups, excluding the signups from those communities say how did the rest of the business do that was in for the entire quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ivy Zelman with Zelman Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","But the $600 million to $700 million incremental in land and development that you're planning on spending, we got lot of questions about Pulte is chasing land, they're late to the market. They stopped buy -- they didn't buy land when everyone else is buying land and now they're paying at inflated prices and given your disciplines around returns, my first question is really understanding how to comfort investors that you are not going to sacrifice returns by now incrementally buying more land?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ivy, this is Richard. First of all, let me just refute directly the fact that we're taking on more risk than we should, as a matter of fact that would be countered to everything that we have said with regard to the last several years about investing in high return communities. We now have this 13-point risk adjusted scale for investment. And frankly, we have stuck to that discipline. We have not chased any land transactions. We do not build in forward price assumptions into our transactions. And in fact, I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the land that we are buying. And frankly, as one of the largest builders in the country, we do have access to land given the size of our checkbook and the land that have been pursuing is of really high-quality across the country. So I completely discount anybody's concern that we are reaching or chasing. And frankly, the rest of our announcement today is indicative of that, as evidence of the fact that we're not going to reach, given the incredibly strong cash flows that we have and frankly are likely to have in the future. We're going to be balanced to ensure in fact that we don't overreach. We've learned the lessons of the past. This company used to be very land heavy. We're not going back there. We want to be very balanced and a combination of prudent, smart, high-returning land, a combination of a growing dividend and maybe stepped up share repurchase activity, I think is evidence of that.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Very helpful. And then secondly, as we talk about one of the proposals from director Mel Watt was to reintroduce the 97% LTV recognizing that with the loan limits are higher in most of the country relative to FHA, if you could talk about specifically Phoenix and some of the Northern Cal markets where it was more dramatic, whether it be Stockton, Fresno, maybe you're not in those areas as much. But if you could just talk about the potential impact that those markets with the higher loan limit and that 97% LTV could have on your business, is it -- in that -- those markets meaningful?","Richard J. Dugas","I guess, great question. It's certainly not insubstantial. A lot of people I think it flew under the radar when the loan limits got dropped. I think people got that really high-cost markets came down from $700 to say $550, but places like Phoenix that or kind of a lot of bread-and-butter housing, a $50,000 or $60,000 drop in loan limits made a big, big difference and took out of swath of the market. So it's again, per someone's earlier question, a little bit hard to quantify exactly what it could mean, but it's clearly a positive. And the only thing we're watchful for is to make sure that it gets implemented responsibly. We've heard the announcements and we're certainly excited about it and through the leading builders of America, our industry has done a good job of advocating for responsible credit and credit that is accessible to all with the right safeguards. And I think we have a good relationship with Mr. Watt and the administration and we're looking forward to seeing what comes of it, but directly to answer your question, it's -- it could be significant. I can't put an exact quantification on it, but it will certainly help housing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Roxland with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As Bob mentioned, the commonly managed floor plans increased to about 45% from 39% in 2Q, yet your gross margins still declined sequentially even after testing for 30 bps of accounting adjustments related to Dominion. Can you talk about some of these that weakened mix shift that occurred in the quarter that negatively impacted margins. And I also believe if I recall correctly got in 2Q also had a weaker mix which impacted margins. So I'm just trying to get sense of what actually occurred this quarter and whether you expect this type of trend to persist or reverse going forward?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, this is Richard. We indicated on the prepared comments, there were 2 factors. One was some unexpected legacy community closeout costs that impacted margins. And second was that mix shift that you mentioned. And frankly, it was less-high margin, Del Webb closings coming through and more lower margin syntax closings coming through. With regard to kind of future trends on mix, it's frankly almost impossible to predict. There is volatility in closing mix and candidly the trade base issues I mention persist in the industry. So overall you can have one particular region versus another closing homes in one quarter. But we continue to be very pleased with our margins. We clearly move from a low-margin company a few years ago to among highest in the space and we like our position overall.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, could you -- will it be fair to say that as you sell out of more of the higher-margin Del Webb and continued to see an acceleration in Centex than maybe you'll have this negative mix shift persist on a go forward basis? And then, just as a second question would be with respect to the accounting adjustments, once you get through them, the next 2 or 3 quarters, should we expect to see gross margins rebound to the 23% or 24% you had been achieving?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, a couple points there. We have said that margins are going to vary quarter-to-quarter and we said that very consistently and I don't see any reason that kind of changed that view. With regard to the second part of your question, we don't have visibility to our margins much beyond the next couple of quarters given sort of our backlog. So frankly, I don't know what's going to happen say as you get into Q2 or Q3 going forward. I will point out that we do have favorable pricing dynamics. We continue to like what we see. We do offsetting that though have higher land cost and some trade pressures coming through. So it's going to be choppy and volatile from here. So it's difficult to give you a guidance number there.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Goldberg with UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up Richard on the comments on labor tightness. And I am wondering if you could help us kind of connect that Common Plan Management system, how that's working with the trade, if it's allowing you to attract some of the trade a little bit more favorably because you have more consistent program going through and also if you can with that kind of talk about cycle times and what's happening on homes that are going through this system, what the cycle times would look like versus homes that haven't been -- maybe as valued engineer or as not as efficient right now?","Richard J. Dugas","Sure, David, it's Richard. From the labor comments, basically what you're seeing is I think has been well chronicled is, they're just not as many folks available to build the homes that are in production across the country as there were. With regard to Common Plan Management, we are able to attract trades that are more favorably inclined to candidly build for us for 2 reasons. Number one, we're big and we have a large backlog and trades understand that consistency to work is important. And then, our Common Plan Management allows for more ease of production as the trade base particularly on the labor side gets more familiar with the plans. So candidly, I would suggest that even though we're seeing some delays in closing as a result of labor shortages, it's probably less pronounced for us than candidly many folks who are smaller in this space and particularly the real small builders, I think are going through a very volatile time, with regard to overall labor. And we are very optimistic that the Common Plan Management rollout as Bob indicates continues to ramp up, it's a very productive part of our business for many, many reasons. With regard to cycle time, we are focused separately on house turn time and land turn time if you will internally. We have a lot of focus on both those areas. And frankly, we made a lot of progress on our house turns in the last few years, including this year. So how much further can we push it, it's hard to say. Frankly, we're -- inventory turns in total are one of the guiding posts around our focus on return, which has been helpful. So I hope that helps.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on the Common Plan Management system, on customer satisfaction, have you been able to do to gauge, I know it's kind of early in the process still, but in terms of quality of construction, in terms of the fact have you been able to kind of gets engage on overall customer satisfaction and warranty related issues on homes that have gone through this system versus the homes that haven't really even versus the historical where you've been?","Richard J. Dugas","David, we certainly have high expectations in that regard. It's probably a little early to look at warranty trends and customer satisfaction trends given the delay between putting these homes in the production closing them and then having people live in them for 1 year or more overall. But clearly everything that we're doing with Common Plan Management we believe has benefits, margin benefits sales space benefits, customer satisfaction benefits. And frankly, to your point, kind of long-term with regard to customer satisfaction and warranty. The features that we're putting in our commonly managed homes, I think a lot of investors appreciate the efficiency gains that we have. We are probably more excited about the actual buyer acceptance of these consumer-driven plans and if you recall the feature CNBC did on us about 1 year ago now, where we're putting homes in productions into prototype and warehouses and getting buyer feedback we're continuing that good work that our marketing and architectural teams are doing. And so we got a lot more of where that comes over time and this whole idea of continuing to refresh our product portfolio while reducing the overall number of floor plans we manage has benefits in all parts of the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was on the share repurchase and we appreciate obviously the increased focus there. I think it certainly helps the more balanced approach to capital, but when you talk about a gross leverage of 30% to 40%, I guess, right now, you are in the high 20s. And you also mentioned that you'd really be excess cash that you would be deploying after internal investment in dividends. So if I'm reading it right, it doesn't sound like this is going to be a sort of a relatively aggressive bulk purchase at any time more of kind of like the perhaps what you did in this past quarter and maybe a little bit more, but can you kind of give any color on that because certainly again from the gross leverage standpoint, it doesn't seem like you have that much wiggle room although, certainly you have a lot of cash on the balance sheet?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, Mike, we do have lot of cash on the balance sheet. We also expect to be generating a lot of cash over the next few years, particularly as we realize the deferred tax asset. But the other thing we've made a point of is we're not stock pickers, so we're not going to be doing an accelerated plan generally. So you can expect us to be buying it sort of dollar cost average through the year, but I think the $750 million speaks to the fact that we're going to be buying more stock.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, and Mike this is Richard. If I could just add having bought back about 4% of our shares with a frankly less-defined program over the past call it 12 to 15 months, we are not talking about insignificant activity, but Bob mentioned on his remarks earlier, we're talking about being routine and systematic and disciplined and balanced, and we see it all as part of a well-orchestrated, well-articulated plan. We think we have articulated our operating philosophy very well for the past several years. We're now trying to articulate our balance sheet and cash philosophy with that same degree of consistency.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess, secondly, on the absorption pace, I think you mentioned Centex down 8%, Pulte down 4%. And generally people viewing the year ago comp is somewhat easier given the rate driven slowdown from last year. You'd also mentioned that the Common Plan Management does drive some improvement in sales pace. And I'm just trying to get a sense of if you're kind of pleased with the sales pace at current levels, did you think it would have improve off of perhaps an easier 1 year ago comp, and what could be done to perhaps increase that going forward?","Richard J. Dugas","So Mike, just a couple of points and Bob can give you the details, but our pace is in Centex and Del Webb were up sharply, especially in Del Webb, so you may have misheard that and we are pleased with our paces. So Bob maybe you can reiterate the numbers.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, so it was up 8%, not down at 8%, Mike. So again, Pulte was up 4%, Centex up 8%, Del Webb up 23%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to sort of follow-up on the land question, the land spend question. You talked about $2.4 billion. We were already modeling it about $1.9 billion. We thought that that was pretty generous. So I was a little surprised, your targeted land spend was about $500 million more than what we're looking for. I was wondering if you could give us some understanding as to the breakout of that spend in terms of new lots versus development of existing lots. And maybe in answering that question if you could let us know whether the 23% of control lots that are finished, how much of those actually are owned versus auctioned?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, so Stephen, we've expressed I'd say over the last 12 months that because we're buying more raw land, our spend during the year has changed. So 2 years ago we were probably we were 2\/3 on land and 1\/3 on development. It's now probably 50-50. So part of the spend that you're seeing us do next year is to develop the land we've been buying over the last 18 or 24 months. So I think not...","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But only half though, but only half, right? Okay.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, it's not an insignificant number though Steve. We're really pleased to with that number. And as we've indicated we have a very clear formula, we get above our cost of capital and we can find high returning assets. We want to grow the business and invest and we spent 2 or 3 years getting our business to that point. We're there now and just to reiterate a comment someone asked earlier, we're definitely not reaching for land. We are being very disciplined and prudent. And frankly, with still a lot of dry powder, we're continuing to return funds to shareholders elsewhere.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I don't think you got the -- I didn't get the finished number?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Oh sorry, he had asked another one, so say it again Steve please?","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, yes, so my question was of the 23% of controlled lots that are finished, I assume the majority of those are owned, but I wanted to check on that. And one other one before I get cut off is that you had talked about in previous quarters perhaps a recovery in the entry-level. I think you'd pointed to some signs in your Centex division. I was curious if you could just quantitatively or qualitatively talk about whether you think that momentum is building, whether it's pulled back, just how you're feeling about the entry-level buyer at this point?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, so Stephen the 80% of those finished lots are owned.","Richard J. Dugas","And then Steve, with regard to the entry level we are pleased with what we've seen. The absorption pace is up 8%. It was up -- excuse me, nicely the prior 2 quarters as well. We do think it's building. And as I indicated, while we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, the potential for some of what Mr. Watt outlined to be enacted has the potential to improve it further, we're going to wait and see what happens. But we thought it was a good announcement that they're at least considering it.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, Stephen, the one thing that we have seen in terms of the entry-level buyer, they're still buying closer in. We haven't seen them really start to go out to some of the outer markets. We've had a couple meetings here in Atlanta and it's a perfect example. Strong demand in the closer in positions, but if you look at some of the outlining areas where there aren't finished developed lots available, they're still no buying going on out there, so we're pretty comfortable in our ability to respond quickly on this. But right now again, the demand is closer in and not further out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First, I wanted to follow-up on the conversation Desi and Bob are having earlier. If you take out the 30-odd communities from Dominion at the end of 3Q, it implies a pretty steep drop in the number of communities. I think you mentioned some of the factors. Obviously, there was the close out of the legacies, which impacted your gross margins as well. You also mentioned that delays in opening new communities. So the drop that we saw here, the significant drop is that just -- how should we think about that? Is that just a temporary mismatch and that the trend that established -- has been established in last few quarters of increasing community count should continue or is there something more than that?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","We have guided between 560 and 580 throughout 2014. So X Dominion, we were right within the guidelines that we have provided.","Richard J. Dugas","And Nishu a little more color on that. Things are taking longer to open. There's no question about that overall. And as Bob indicated in his prepared remarks that persists. So we're trying to be balanced and not get communities open before they're ready and before we're ready to present a good sales image overall. But I don't think that implies anything one way or another kind of going forward. And as we indicated earlier, we will be giving guidance for 2015s community count on our Q4 call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Dahl with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to go back Richard to your comments on the entry-level buyer a minute ago. And I was curious because you still said that I think in earlier remarks, land deals are best for so that move up and active adult. So in your budgeting for next year, is that contemplating more of a shift towards more of the Centex type communities?","Richard J. Dugas","Mike, it's a good question. And the way we do that is when we allocate capital to the operations, we are agnostic as to where they spend it. We want it to go to the highest returning opportunities that they find, and they clearly have a targeted plan. But we don't push it towards say Pulte or Centex or Del Webb, any of the brands. So the answer is I don't know how exactly that's going to play out. Overall it depends on what we see in the market when folks are requiring property. What I will say is the same factors that go into the underwriting are the same ones. So what we said consistently is that up to now, while margins have been very acceptable in that category paces have not recovered yet to where we believe they are needed to underwrite a lot of Centex communities because given the limited pricing power that we have on the buyer income side with regard to Centex, we need more pace to support good returns. As the market recovers and particularly if the entry-level begins to see a little bit more credit availability, the potential does exist for that category to come back and therefore, for us to start seeing more land deals there. But it will be dependent on whether the pace comes back to a point at which that becomes a bigger factor. So I don't know exactly how that's going to play out. I think it's clear based on what we have purchased the last year or 2 that for the foreseeable year to 18 months most of our openings are going to be on the Pulte or Del Webb side, but we're hopeful that could change with a little better availability in the future for credit.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up at a high-level you also made comments that you want to be careful to avoid getting into stretching for growth rates that are going to put real strain on the organization and clearly you've had some runoff of legacy land, but this will be the second year looking out to 2015 that you're looking for 40% growth on the spend side and so a lot more of that coming. On development, that does support quite a bit of growth. So how do you reconcile that like how close are you to a level where you're less comfortable pushing for growth aggressively?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, again, we're not giving kind of community count guidance, but land investment dollars don't necessarily translate into volume or community count directly. It totally depends on what you're buying, what markets you're buying it in, how expensive the land was where you are. So I am not concerned about us approaching the level of which we get concerned about growth. We are nowhere near candidly the growth rates of what we use to be in the past through the boom times. And as I started out the prepared remarks and my first question out of box today, we are not going back there. We're going to be very balanced with our view. We're going to be balanced with our capital allocation and mindful of what can happen when we get overly aggressive. So we're not close to that edge at all and frankly not concerned about it, but we're very mindful of it and are going to be cautious.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow up I wanted to ask was Richard about the Investor Day. It's been quite some time since you had an Investor Day. And that certainly not from a lack of exciting things happening at Pulte. Value Creation strategy being conceived and executed well in the past couple of years, so I wanted to get your thoughts on what prompted the decision to kind of create an special outreach event for investors? And maybe if you could just some preview on what you will be covering, because clearly it has created some excitement around the event.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, I appreciate that. First of all, this is not something that we intend to do every year. And it's been many years as you've indicated. We think we have a great story to tell. And while we have gotten pieces of the message out over the last several years, we don't feel like we have had a forum to really tell the entire story. So what you can expect is a little bit of a view onto what the details were and how we got to the philosophy that we are today. We're certainly going to expose you to some of the possibilities for the future with regard to what Common Plan Management can do for us, what our pricing philosophies can do and demonstrate for investors that there's more energy around some of the things that we have been working on than have yet kind of come to the market. And then we're going to get a little more detailed on this capital allocation strategy. How we got to it, what the parameters are and basically walk into a little more detail than we're able to do on an earnings call like today. So we think it's a very robust lineup. We look forward to seeing as many investors there as possible and it should be a good day for us.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session for today's conference.

Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Jim and good morning. I\u2019m extremely pleased with you this morning about PulteGroup\u2019s strong operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. At the outset of the housing recovery, we explained our focus on improving the company\u2019s fundamental business performance and overall returns on invested capital.","As our business and financial metrics improved, we then discussed the opportunity to systematically increase our land investment, which we did beginning later in 2013. Then headed in to 2016, we talked about the year being an inflexion point for the company, as our increased land investment would begin delivering higher growth. ","As our financial results indicate, 2016 was indeed that inflexion point as we realized a meaningful expansion of our business. On a year-over-year basis, PulteGroup reported 13% growth in unit sign-ups to 20,326 homes, while closing volume increased 16% to just shy of 20,000 homes, benefiting from a 10% increase in ASP for the year, home sale revenues increased 29% to $7.5 billion and perhaps mostly importantly our reported earnings increased 29% to $1.75 per share. ","While growth is important, it is worth highlighting that consistent with our focus on creating value for our shareholders, the significant growth in our business was achieved while continuing to deliver high returns on invested capital and equity. ","Clearly 2016 was a year of exceptional performance and progress for the company, and has us well positioned for continued success in 2017 and beyond. While 2016 was an inflexion point in the growth trajectory and performance of our business. We expect 2017 to be another outstanding year as we continue to realize benefits from prior year investments. ","It is important to remember though that we are seeking to build a business that consistently generates higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. As such, we will continue to stress running a balanced business. As I explained on our last earnings call, I see opportunities for us to realize a better balance across the buyer groups we serve. ","In 2016, roughly 43% of our deliveries were to move up buyers which reflect increased investment in that segment in prior years. Going forward, there may be opportunities for us to diversify and expand our business among first time and active adult buyers, where the huge booking generations of the millennials and boomers will influence demand for years to come. ","Our emphasis on building for the move-up buyer has served us extremely well during the initial leg of the housing recovery. But we want to make sure we aren\u2019t missing opportunities that would allow us to further broaden and grow our business while diversifying risk. Consistent with this idea of being balanced, our goal is to drive high rates of return, by properly managing the key inputs of sales pace, margin and inventory turns. ","We have done a tremendous job improving our margin since 2011, now we have to make sure we are effectively turning our assets in support of delivering high returns by maintaining the right sale and construction pace. Critical to delivering high returns is that we remain disciplined in our land investment practices and work to be increasingly efficient in managing our land inventories. ","We have talked often about the 13 point risk waiting criteria that we used to underwrite every deal. By consistently underwriting projects with returns in excess of 20% as measured by the scale, we can further improve returns and lower our overall risk profile. This risk based approach is now deeply embedded in our operating philosophy and we will continue to do it here to these underwriting guidelines in the future. ","As we think about delivering consistent, long-term returns, it\u2019s not just about what projects we are investing in, but how we are investing in those projects. We are actively looking for opportunities to control more land via option.","In 2016, 42% of the lots we approved were initially controlled under some form of option agreement, allowing us to be more efficient with our capital while helping to lower overall risks. Beyond the what and the how of the projects we invest in, is the how much capital we chose to invest. ","We\u2019ve talked about previously several years of 30% plus compound annual growth in our land spend has meaningfully improved our land pipeline. As such, we were able to materially slow the growth of investment going forward, while still expanding our business. We currently expect land acquisition spend in 2017 to be approximately $1.1 billion, which comparable to our 2016 investment ex John Wieland. ","Given our prior investments, we are in a position to deliver additional volume growth in 2017. We also expect to realize even higher returns on invested capital, given plans to moderate the rate of land spend, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate our inventory turns. ","In 2017, I also expect to take additional steps in our work to raise the bar on construction quality and customer experience even higher. Though it can be difficult to quantify, I believe improving the products and experience we deliver can over time enhance sales, improve revenues and decrease future warranty costs. As such, it is an opportunity that we continue to pursue. ","Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thanks Ryan and good morning. Our Q4 results represent the completion of an outstanding year for the company, as we realized significant gains throughout our business and resulting financial performance. Consistent with Ryan\u2019s comments of 2016 being an inflexion year in terms of realizing higher growth, our fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 21% to $2.4 billion. A higher revenue in the quarter reflects a 9% increase in closings to 6,197 homes, along with an 11% increase in average selling price to $391,000.","Our Q4 conversion rate at 66% was slightly above last year and our prior guidance for the quarter. Our ability to close additional homes reflects a number of factors including our decision to selectively start more spec production earlier in the year, the efforts we\u2019ve made to strengthen our trade base and perhaps most importantly the hard work of all of our employees.","We\u2019re certainly pleased with the steady progress made towards being more efficient in converting our construction pipeline in 2016, but labor resources are still tight across many of our markets. As such, we\u2019ll continue our strategy of selectively including spec units as we plan our product pipeline to help develop a more even construction case. ","With all this in mind, we currently expect our first quarter conversion rate to be comparable to Q1 of last year. ","Looking at the mix of our fourth quarter closings, 30% was first time, 43% was move up and 27% active adult. This is consistent with last year, when the closing break down was 31% first time, 40% move-up and 29% active adults. ","As I mentioned, our revenue also benefitted from the 11% increase in our average sales price this quarter. The higher average sales price reflects the ongoing shift in the mix of homes or buildings coupled with higher prices realized in each of our buyer groups. In fact, our ASPs were up 20% to $301,000 for our first time buyers up 9% to $464,000 for our move-up buyers and up 6% to $374,000 for our active adult buyers. ","The large increase in average sale price for first time buyers was driven primarily by mix, as we realized a large increase in homes closed in California which as you would expect carry much higher prices relative to the rest of the country. ","With our backlog ASP up 8% over the last year to $296,000, and given the mix of communities we plan to open over the course of 2017, we expect our ASP will continue to move higher through \u201917 and is likely to average above $400,000 for the full year. ","Before I address our gross margins, I\u2019d like to cover a change in the way we are classifying sales commissions. As we highlighted in our press release, we\u2019ve elected to re-classify both internal and external sales commissions from home sales cost of revenues to SG&A. This adjustment makes our income statement presentation more consistent with the majority of our home building fears and we believe is responsive to some of the questions and feedback we\u2019ve received over the years. ","To assist in your analysis we are posting three years of financial results to our website, each is adjust to reflect the new classifications. Having said that our reported home sale gross margin for the fourth quarter was 24.8%, the comparable prior year fourth quarter gross margin was 27.1%. ","Consistent with comments we\u2019ve made on prior earnings calls, margins continue to be impacted by higher land costs as we are turning over almost one-third of our communities each year, as well as labor costs which are continuing to increase across many of our markets. ","Looking at the year ahead, we continue to target full year 2017 gross margins of 24% to 24.5% likely still the highest in the industry, as we continue to benefit from operational changes we made as part of our value creation work. ","Just to be clear, this range is the same as the guidance we gave previously related to 2017 margins, simply adjusted to reflect our reclassification of commissions in to SG&A. That being said, given our current estimate for house cost to increase by 1.5% to 2% as well as potential impacts related to affordability due to rising interest rates, we anticipate being towards the low end of guidance range. ","Turning upon the demographic and geographic mix of homes closed in a given period, reported quarterly gross margin could range from 23.5% to 25% with Q1 expected to be the low quarter of the year. ","Our gross margins continue to be supported by our focus on maximizing loss premiums and option revenues. In fact, total options revenue and loss premiums gained 7% over last year to approximately $73,000 per closing. However, sales discounts of 3.2% or $12,500 per home while still modest, did increase 40 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year. ","Our reported fourth quarter SG&A including commissions, totaled $208 million or 8.6% of home sale revenues. This includes the benefit of $55 million relating to the reversal of construction related reserves realized in the quarter. ","Comparable prior year SG&A spend was $210 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues which included a $30 million benefit from a similar reversal of constructed related insurance reserves. Adjusting for the reclassification of commissions and consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our full year 2017 SG&A to be approximately 12.5% of revenues. As a result, we continue to expect our full year 2017 operating margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12%. ","Turning to our Financial Services businesses, we reported pre-tax income of $25 million in the fourth quarter as the operations benefited from the increase in homebuilder closing volumes. This compares to $29 million last year, which included a benefit of $12 million resulting from a reversal of mortgage repurchase reserves. ","Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 82% compared with 83% last year. In the aggregate, we reported fourth quarter pre-tax income of $414 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year. For the quarter, the company reported a $141 million of income tax expense, representing an effective tax rate of 34%. The company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than its previous guidance of 38% due to the recognition of energy efficient home credits, as well as a deferred tax benefit related to a legal entity restructuring. ","While we\u2019re around the topic of taxes, I\u2019d like to note that we currently expect to fully utilize our remaining federal net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in 2017. As a result, we expect to become a federal cash tax payer on a portion of our taxable earnings in 2017. ","As we become a cash tax payer, we can take advantage of the section 199 manufacturing deduction which we expect will decrease effective 2017 tax rate by approximately 1.5%. As a result, we expect our 2017 full year tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.","It is important to note that everything we\u2019ve outlined for 2017 assumes that no corporate tax reform takes place. Like all tax payers, we\u2019re paying close attention to dialog related to possible changes to the federal tax laws. The timing and specific language associated with any tax reform is critical to calculating the potential impacts on our cash flows and the value of our deferred tax assets. As such we have to wait to see the actual legislative before determining future impacts. ","Closing out the review of our income statement, net income for the quarter was $273 million or $0.83 per share, which includes $0.16 per share of insurance and tax benefits realized in the quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share are calculated using approximately 328 million shares, which is decrease of approximately 7% from 2015, resulting primarily from share repurchase activity. ","Moving to our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $723 million of cash. During the quarter, we spent $252 million to repurchase 13.2 million shares at an average price of $19.07 per share. For the full year, the company spent $600 million to repurchase 30.9 million shares or 8.8% of its outstanding shares. ","As previously announced, the company plans to repurchase an additional $1 billion of its common shares in 2017. The timing of planned repurchases will be driven in part by the normal seasonal cash flows of the business and subject to overall business and financial market conditions. ","Our year-end debt-to-cap was 40% which is within the 30% to 40% range in which we seek to operate. Depending upon the timing of future share repurchases we may move above 40%, but expected future earnings should work to quickly de-lever our overall cash structure. ","Let me finish with a few details on our homebuilding operations. At the end of the quarter, we had a total 7,486 homes under construction which is an increase 15% over last year. Consistent with our strategy to use specs to better maintain our production levels, specs with 31% of year-end homes under construction which is consistent with last year. We ended the quarter with 645 finished specs, as we continue to average less than one finished spec per community. ","For the fourth quarter, we generated 4,202 sign-ups which is an increase of 15% over Q4 of last year. On a dollar basis, sign-ups were up 22% to $1.7 billion. Breaking down science by buyer group, sales to first time buyers gained 12% to 1,116 homes, while sign-ups to move up buyers increased 27% to 1,985 homes. Sign-ups to active adult buyers were 1% from last year and totaled 1,100 homes. ","Our community count was up 17% in the fourth quarter to 726. Our community count growth was slightly ahead of our guidance due to the slower close-out of a few communities. As we did in 2016, we again expect turn over roughly one-third of our communities in 2017 and anticipate overall community count growth in the range of 5% to 10% for the year. Year-over-year growth in community should be fairly consistent between the front and back halves of the year. ","Supporting this growth, the company continued to invest in the business approving roughly 6,000 per purchase during the quarter, including a replacement Del Webb community in Southern California. Excluding the 1,000 lots associated with this Del Webb position, our average deal size includes just over a hundred lots that we expect to have a duration of roughly 2.5 years from the time we open for sales.","Consistent with the trends we have seen for the past several years, most of these lots will require development. However, we are pleased to see that over a third of the deals were option transactions allowing us to improve asset efficiency and reduce potential market risk. For the full year in 2016, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on land acquisition excluding the assets we purchased from John Wieland. ","As Ryan mentioned, we expect our 2017 land acquisition spend to be approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect to increase our land development spend by approximately 10% to $1.6 billion At year-end, we owned approximately 99,000 lots while controlling another 44,000 lots via auction. ","Based our trailing 12 month closing volumes, we\u2019ve lowered our owned lots supplied to less than five years. Our goal is to continue to shorten the duration of our land pipeline by continuing to focus our investment on smaller, faster turning communities, while continuing to work down our large legacy Del Webb communities. ","We ended 2016 with a strong land pipeline that can support ongoing growth in 2017. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, as we seek to open upwards of [250] new communities in 2017, we have the required land and are optimistic better opportunities heading in to the selling season. ","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Bob. Fourth quarter and full year 2016 results for PulteGroup and the overall US housing market point to continued growth in housing demand. After several years of strong job formations and low unemployment, supported by favorable demographics, there are signs that housing demand is now being bolstered by an improving economy and recent gains in consumer sentiments. ","Against this increasingly positive background, we are mindful that interest rates have been rising over the past couple of months. However, coming off such a low starting point, it is certainly reasonable to expect that housing demand can continue to expand especially if the rise in rates truly reflects increased expansion of the US economy. ","We are fortunate that the initial increase in rates took place during the seasonal slow point for housing sales. Buyer expectations have had time to adjust to these new market conditions, so expectations can be properly set as we head in to this spring selling season. ","While it is challenging to assess buyer sentiment during the slower winter months, we believe higher rates have so far had minimal impact on demand. We will obviously have a better read on the buyer as we move through the first two quarters of the year. But based on Q4 results, we are optimistic heading in to 2017. ","Specific to the fourth quarter, market conditions were generally consistent, albeit at seasonally lower volumes, with the trends experienced earlier in the year. In the east, demand conditions in Florida and up through the southeast generally remained positive. Demand in Florida remained strong, although our results for the quarter were a little choppy given the timing of community close-outs and openings. ","I would add that our results showed consistent improvement as the quarter progressed. We realized improved year-over-year sales volumes in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets, but still view these as very competitive where we\u2019ve had to battle for each sale particularly in DC. ","Demand in the middle third of the country remained strong in the quarter, as our Mid-West and Texas operations both posted year-over-year sign-up increases exceeding 20%. Houston was particularly in the quarter, and given the recent gains in the price of oil 2017 could see a sustained recovery in demand. ","And finally, looking out west demand conditions were favorable although we experienced some volatility as we move from week to week from the quarter. It is only got stronger as we move through the quarter, while northern Cal slowed a little. That being said, our divisions have a positive view heading in to 2017. ","While we are only a few weeks into the new year, we are pleased with the overall demand conditions which suggest that higher rates are not dampening buyer interest and that 2017 can be another year of growth for the industry. Given the good start we are seeing, we are excited to get in to this spring selling season.","Let me close by thanking all employees of PulteGroup. You helped grow the business the right way in 2016 by remaining focused on building a great home and delivering an outstanding customer experience. Together we can look forward to an even bigger and better 2017. ","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","Jim Zeumer","Thank you Ryan. Just reinforcing Bob\u2019s message, you can find the historical financial results on our website in the financial information section under the investor relations tab. With that said, we\u2019ll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining term of the call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Eric if you\u2019ll explain the process, we\u2019ll get started with Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] we\u2019ll take our first quarter from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. ","Nishu Sood","I wanted to ask first about the impressive ASP growth, certainly ahead of your peers in the past couple of quarters. And Bob you were talking about how we should expect that to continue in \u201917. You talked about entry level, the mix shift to California. Just wanted to get a sense of how did that effect on the fourth quarter? Just want to understand the drivers of the ASP growth across the divisions or maybe even regionally? What\u2019s going to drive it to stay above 400 in \u201917?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yeah Nishu, I think it\u2019s a couple of things. Mix matter geographically, so certainly in the fourth quarter this year what drove some of the increase was heavier concentration of California [closures] where prices are higher. In terms of going forward, it\u2019s a continued mix shift to some degree. We obviously over the last three or four years invested a great deal on the move-up space that has a higher average sales price. As we mentioned in the fourth quarter it was $464,000. So as you see more of those communities opening, you\u2019ll see the price mix higher. And again as you saw this year, sort of a sequential increase quarter-over-quarter, our expectation is you\u2019ll see the same thing in 2017. ","Nishu Sood","On the share buybacks, the $250 million a quarter, obviously you\u2019ve been on track with that for 3Q and 4Q. As we look out across \u201917 and other that\u2019s coming in to a little bit clear view, how do you expect that to impact the balance sheet? You mentioned that you should be able to deleverage. Are these share repurchase you continue at this aggressive pace to the tune of $50 million. Is it going to be mostly internally funded? ","Now you\u2019ve laid out first expectation for 2.7 billion in land spend. What should the debt-to-cap roughly look like by the end of the year and how is it going to be funded, mostly internally or will there need to be some additional debt raises?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Nishu, its Bob, I think what we\u2019ve highlighted is we\u2019d like to stay at or near that 40% rate. It\u2019s our belief that we can stay there, we\u2019ve talked about needing to maybe go outside that a little bit. It\u2019s much a function of buying down the equity makes the percentage just naturally accrete higher. ","But in terms of the cash flows of the business, yeah we like many in the industry have typically outflows in the first half of the year, as we build house and develop lots that we will deliver later in the year so the cash flow is skewed more heavily towards the back half of the year. ","You and should expect us to have that impact the way we buy stock during the year, and so we\u2019ve talked about by the end of the year probably being low 40s in terms of debt-to-cap, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a significant need for liquidity. It will obviously depend total closings, cash flow generation, and profitability. But we think that within the construct of the capital structure today, we think we can manage through it. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo","The first question is the Midwest orders were notably stronger than we were for at least. Did you guys see any pickup in demand in some of the rust belt states that may have coincided with consumer confidence that was very strong post-election there? ","Ryan Marshall","John, its Ryan, thanks for the question. We continue to like the strength of our business in the Midwest. We\u2019ve got excellent land positions there, we have very good operators, we have nice market share. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we did see a bump in consumer sentiment that I think certainly contributed to the strength in the year-over-year increases that we noted in the Midwest section. ","John Lovallo","And then order growth, it looks like it was largely driven by community count opening this quarter, and by our estimate absorptions what we know were down slightly. How are you guys thinking about the community count absorption mix in 2017?","Ryan Marshall","As I think Bob mentioned John, we are expecting 5% to 10% growth in 2017 that will be balanced throughout the year as we move through 2017. We noted that our year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter was 17% community count growth, which was slightly outside the range that we had previously provided, which was mostly been driven by the slow close-out of a few older communities. So we like the community count growth and we\u2019re also very positive about what our absorptions were in the quarter.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","So John the absorptions were actually, if you look at the straight calculation down a little bit. But if you exclude the Wieland communities which we\u2019ve talked about in the past being slow moving, we actually saw roughly 2% increase in absorptions and across the universe that was flattish on the entry level up 2% on move-up and up 5% on the active adult. So we did some growth there if you take out the impact of the slower moving Wieland communities. ","Operator","Next it\u2019s Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. ","Michael Rehaut","Good morning every one and nice quarter, and I also have to say congrats on the commission reclassification. I guess if it wasn\u2019t known that I\u2019m a homebuilding nerd and I could be so excited about that, that this should put that to rest. And I encourage others, the few remaining builders to follow your lead. ","My first question just going back to the sales pace a little bit, and wanted to understand some of your peers have had absorption pace improvement in fiscal \u201916. And you highlighted flat on first time and up 2% of move-ups. So just trying to get a sense of where the gap might be that some of your peers. Is it perhaps geographic, is it more of a pace versus price equation or if there is certain community mix driving that, because I do think that as its recovery progresses particularly on the first time side which we\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity, I\u2019d expect some of the pace improvement to be a little bit better everything else equal. ","Ryan Marshall","Hey Mike its Ryan. I\u2019ll take - there\u2019s a lot in that question, I\u2019ll take a couple of pieces of it and then we may have to come back and clean up some of the loose ends. We\u2019re very proud of the margins that we have and it\u2019s been part of our value creation strategy aimed at driving overall return on invested capital. ","Certainly as I talk about in some of my prepared remarks, it\u2019s important to balance the pace and price equation, margins are one component of that making sure that we\u2019re continuing to turn our assets are also part of that component. But we like what\u2019s going on with our business. We\u2019re turning our assets, we\u2019ve got strong margins, we\u2019ve got strong profitability, we\u2019re growing our earnings. Those are all very good things for our investors and for our shareholder base and we like what we\u2019re seeing. ","Michael Rehaut","I guess second question just on the gross margins. I believe you said pre-reclassification that the margins that you\u2019re expecting in \u201917 are much closer to what you\u2019d consider longer term gross margins. So I just wanted to know, if I recall that correctly and if you still view that to be the case. ","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yeah, Mike its Bob. I don\u2019t think we characterize margins as being something that can be, correct my word fixed. They will move overtime, we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last several years really high margins we still do. The market will ultimately dictate where margins go from here. But we do think we\u2019re operating a little bit differently the way we are creating floor plans, the way we\u2019re underwriting our land transactions, should lend itself to continued strong margins. ","But it\u2019s important to remember; we underwrite through return and so as an example, the more option transactions we do could influence the margins, mix matters. The more entry level or first time business we do could influence margins. So, as Ryan said we feel very good about margin profile today. I don\u2019t want to say that it will be here forever though. ","Ryan Marshall","The other thing too Mike that I\u2019d add to Bob\u2019s comments there, we\u2019ve made real improvement in our SG&A leverage year-over-year or going to show about a 100 basis points of incremental leverage. When you combine a very strong margin profile with some added SG&A leverage, you get down to the operating margin line that we\u2019ve provided guidance of 11.5% to 12% also puts us in a very competitive spot within the peer side. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. ","Bob Wetenhall","Ryan I just wanted to see if you could dig down a little bit in to the SG&A leverage. You kind of higher than the peer group, you obviously have a strong operational background. Are the changes you need to make on the SG&A side a cost management issue or is it just a function driving sales higher and extracting the leverage out of P&L?","Ryan Marshall","Couple of things that I\u2019d point out, excluding the insurance benefit that we realized in Q4, we\u2019re forecasting lowering 2017 SG&A as a percent of revenue by about 100 basis points as I mentioned, and that\u2019s relative to 2016 . So we\u2019re on track to drive meaningful overhead leverage in the business in \u201917. ","We talked in our last quarter earnings call, part of that was coming from peer growth in the business, part of that was coming from absolute cost reduction. As to your comment about our cost higher, we believe that part of the difference between us and some of our peers are the investments that we\u2019re making and delivering a superior product quality, as well as customer experience and we think that that\u2019s a differentiator for our company and frankly as part of our strategy, and we believe we get the benefit of that in higher gross margin. ","So part of the reason you hear us talk about gross margins, SG&A leverage and then ultimately operating margins and looking at it in totality. What I would tell you about SG&A Bob is, SG&A discipline is going to be a focus of mine. We have continued room for leverage and it will be a focus of buying to go and get it, and we\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019re making, but I don\u2019t think - I know that\u2019s not where we\u2019re going to stop, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. ","Bob Wetenhall","Bob, it sounds like your gross margin guidance is towards the low end of the range and you also caught out the fact that you got this favorable mix shift towards California which is driving our [ASP], and I\u2019m just trying to understand inside the gross margin, are you seeing a lot of lot cost inflation and inflation on labor and materials, which is offsetting the favorable mix? What\u2019s the right way to think about gross margin? And perhaps I\u2019m wrong on this, maybe it\u2019s an issue versus like a shift to spec or something. Any clarity how to think about the next 12 months on gross margin would be great.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","I think the way you said at the start of that question is right. As we have cycled through, we\u2019re turning over a third of our asset base or a third of our community count each year and so the land that is feeding in to our cost of sales is increasing overtime. ","Certainly input costs are rising particularly labor, and so what you\u2019re seeing is, against the backdrop where non-mix adjusted pricing isn\u2019t increasing as rapidly as it was two or three years ago, we\u2019re feeling a little bit pressure because our input costs are going up a little bit faster than the ASP has over the last 12 months compared to say 36 months ago. ","So for us it\u2019s a continuation of that theme in 2017. I don\u2019t think you should think about it in terms of spec versus non-spec. We\u2019re not changing our stripes there. We put a little more in to the production pipeline, but it\u2019s only about 30% which isn\u2019t terribly different than it was a year ago. ","And then mix, the mix question it\u2019s not geographic, right. Our margin profile doesn\u2019t change that much across different parts of the country. Certainly there\u2019s a little bit of a mix differential entry level versus move up versus the active adult space, and so that influences our margin. But we don\u2019t see that having significant impact next year. ","And the other thing that obviously feeds in to our margins is the interest expense. Obviously our interest costs are up in fiscal \u201917 versus \u201916 because of the capital raises that we did in net in 2016. But we think that essentially gets offset by volume differential so we think it\u2019s a neutral on our margin \u201916 to \u201917. So I don\u2019t know if that helps, but all those things factor in, but I would tell you land and input cost particularly labor are the primary drivers. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next Mike Dahl with Barclays. ","Mike Dahl","Just wanted to go back to some of the comments around the land spend and the balance sheet. And it sounded like just tying a couple of things together would suggest that cash from op should see real nice improvement in 2017, just to get to those balance sheet targets. So just wanted to get any sense of quantification you can provide on cash flow? And then related to that as you think about, there seems to be a kind of pivot towards a longer journey of improving turns and if there is anything you can give us as far as also quantification for inventory turn targets that would be great. ","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","I\u2019ll start Mike, in terms of free cash flow generation we haven\u2019t provided any guidance. I think it is fair to say we expect the business to grow in \u201917 and against that backdrop not spending as much on land acq in particular but also land development combined that we expect to be cash flow generative this year. ","I think if you could take a step back, we are not pivoting away from investing in the business, but what we are doing is spending money today to improve the assets that we\u2019ve acquired over the last couple of years which we think generates growth in closings, and so we\u2019re spending more on development. ","So historically if you\u2019d gone two years ago, we were probably 50-50 land acq versus development spend. Given the numbers that you saw today, that number is clearly moving more towards development, which bodes well for cash generation because what we are doing is improving the assets to generate sales and actually getting a return on our investment which you heard Ryan talk about. ","We want to be balanced in that. So we don\u2019t have our foot quite as heavy on the gas for growth for future acquisition, but we want to maintain the growth associated with the investors we made over the last couple of years. ","Ryan Marshall","And Mike as you heard us probably say in the prepared remarks, our ability to do that is really because of the 30% annual compound growth rate that we had on land acquisition investment really starting in 2013. So the health of our land pipeline is quite robust and we\u2019re setup for very nice success and very nice growth as we move in to the future years. ","I\u2019ll take the piece or your question that you had on inventory turns. Inventory turns is a huge part of driving the type of returns on investment that we\u2019re looking for. Land is clearly the biggest investment that we have on our balance sheet and so as we\u2019re going to move the needle on overall inventory turns, the focus is squarely on efficiency of land. ","You heard me talk about a focus being in getting more efficient and lean with our land inventory. We provided a few more details on that today, but if you look at our current vintage of acquisitions that we\u2019re making, there\u2019s a heavy percentage of options which certainly help with the goal of driving inventory turns. The average year supply is near three, even slightly below three and the average size of those excluding a couple of large Del Webb acquisitions are around 100. ","So we think we are doing some very nice things that are different and going to create enhanced inventory turns for us in the future. ","Mike Dahl","And that\u2019s what I kind of driving at because clearly this is one of the one of the main levers to drive real improvement in returns over the next couple of years just in terms of how you\u2019re turning the land and managing the owned option mix, and so to follow-up on that because I think option deals have been difficult to come by in a lot of places and for a lot of builders. So could you give us any examples of successes that you can keep it broad regionally and where are you having the most success walking up new deals on the option side and where are you still seeing some challenges? ","Ryan Marshall","Mike I\u2019ll let Bob take that one, maybe I\u2019ll just chime in with one little overwriting comment, and then I\u2019ll let Bob give you a little bit more color. But 46% of our acquisitions recently had some component of an option mixed in to the transaction. Certainly options are attractive, we strive to get them. We\u2019re not going to overpay however, solely for the goal of having more options. ","The goal again is to manage risk, to drive a better and higher return on invested capital. When it makes sense to do options we\u2019re certainly going to strive to do it. I\u2019ll let Bob give you a little more color on some of the geographic. ","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Mike we\u2019ve talked about it before. It\u2019s actually - I don\u2019t know that there is a geographic ability to do with the hire in one place versus another necessarily. They are all individually negotiated, sometimes we chose to put our money partner in between, but that\u2019s a little bit more challenging because return is scarce on a relative basis and they want some and we want some. ","What I would offer is, markets where we have good, long, deep relationships with the land community and have high relative market share offer us more opportunities. We get to see more deals, we see them earlier and so our opportunities there seem to lend themselves to more activity again where we\u2019ve got again a long tenured land team and with good relative market share. ","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","I wanted to ask you two questions if I could related to leverage, I guess. First I was wondering if you could tell us how you prioritize M&A in the current environment relative to repurchases, let\u2019s say, given that your leverage is already now expected to rise above your targeted range this year?","Ryan Marshall","Stephen this is Ryan. Our prioritization of capital remains in the following order: investment in to our ongoing operations specifically land is priority number one. We include M&A in that same category. So we look at it very much like a land transaction to the extent that we can do an M&A deal, it certainly gives us in many cases a ready now or a quicker land pipeline versus buying something raw that\u2019s got to go through the entitlement process. ","The second piece of our capital strategy was to continue to fund our dividend which we are doing. And then the third piece of that strategy was a share buyback. Given where we were at with the state of our business, we made a decision to announce a $1.5 billion share buyback that\u2019s taken place over the last 18 months. We\u2019ve executed on the 500 million piece of that in 2016 in the back half. We\u2019re going to continue to execute against that plan for the $1 billion in 2017. ","But, look, we\u2019re out in the market, we\u2019re looking for opportunities. Certainly evaluation comes in to play when we are looking at M&A, no different than we wouldn\u2019t overpay for a piece of raw land we don\u2019t want to over pay for a potential acquisition either. ","I\u2019ll let Bob take the debt-to-cap piece. ","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","I think the only think I would add to it Ryan just as Stephen is, we\u2019ve also always said that while the guard rails are 30% to 40%, we would go above or beneath them if we saw a compelling reason to do so. But that you should expect us to tell you when we do that and how we expect to get back in to those guard rails. ","So, example, if there were transactions that we found compelling that would make up a factor here, push us to a 45% debt-to-cap ratio, we would do that if we thought it was beneficial to shareholders. ","Having said that, we would probably expect say as part of that dialog saying here is how and when we would expect to be able to drive that ratio back in to our 30% to 40% range. So certainly they are not mutually exclusive, we can do both. It really would boil down to Ryan\u2019s point, if we saw a compelling to buy it because we look at it as a land transaction. ","Stephen Kim","My next question is a little bit more broad about leverage. I think that having gone through the cycles that we all have, I think most people would say and probably the most important thing that we need to keep in mind as a builder is to make sure that our leverage that we\u2019re keeping an eye on our leverage ratio at all time. ","What strikes me so interesting right now is that your two largest competitors seem to be prioritizing a more defensive approach I might say to leverage and their current net debt-to-cap ratio is they are kind of moving below their historical norms. One is way below and the other one is near the bottom end of the range that you would kind of talked about and seems like it\u2019s moving somewhat lower. ","You all have talked about moving to a balanced approach towards products mix, but your leverage is moving well above peers were not too long ago you were among the lowest in the industry. So from a leverage perspective it seems you\u2019re essentially almost trading strategies with your peers, and I was wondering, could you sort of articulate for us what you think the essence of the disagreement is or what you see differently and why is this the right time in the cycle to lever up rather than to de-lever?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yeah I don\u2019t consider it candidly levering up. I mean we are at a higher rate than we were for all the reasons that Ryan just talked about. We invested in the business including M&A and two deals that were fairly significant capital users, and we are buying back our shares which again was part of the strategy. And all with it, if you remember back, this was December of \u201914 when we did the investor day, we said those are our priorities. And again the guide rails are 30% to 40%. ","I can\u2019t comment on what our peers are doing. I think what you\u2019re hearing from most and you are hearing from us as we see continued growth in this space to the ability to earn return on the investments we\u2019re making. ","So it\u2019s interesting, I don\u2019t think we are trading out our strategy, we\u2019re executing on it, and we\u2019re at the higher end of our range, but we think that we can de-lever that overtime as we run the business. So, interestingly if you talk about land approach while we are investing in the business to everything you heard us talk about, we are focused on shorter, faster, turning, high asset efficiency transactions which we think mitigates risk, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at, risk management. ","We think our strategy fits in that and so not being defensive, I don\u2019t think we really have \u201clevered\u201d up. Yes, it\u2019s a little bit higher, but certainly within the framework that we want to operate. ","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, and Stephen I\u2019d also add to that. When you look at the maturities of our long term debt it\u2019s very attractive. So certainly we\u2019re paying attention to a number of things, we\u2019re paying attention to what our absolute debt-to-cap rate is, we\u2019re paying attention to what we think the growth of the business looks like, and the cash flow that\u2019s going to be generated and then what those long term maturities are. ","And I think when we put all of that in to the soup and we come out with what our strategy is, we like them a lot and we\u2019re running it. Certainly your job is to compare us to our peers and pay attention to the differences, but I think we \u2018re running our strategy as opposed to as Bob as opposed to taking someone else\u2019s.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. ","Stephen East","Ryan I\u2019ll come back to with the ROIC question in a minute, but I\u2019ll give you all a change of pace for a second. You are the third builder in three days that the fourth quarter orders are stronger than historical season patters. So as we look at that, do you all think you\u2019re seeing pull forward going on in the industry or has demand just ramped from the third quarter for you all and if you think for the industry. ","And then when you look at your segments, could you talk a little bit about it. I was surprised that active adult was not stronger than it was from an order perspective. So if you could just talk about the three product segments and what you think you all have seen. ","Ryan Marshall","Steven this is Ryan, so thanks for the question, a couple of things here. Let me take the segment question first, when we look at the active adult segment it\u2019s historically a segment that performs better in the spring selling season. If you think where the locations of those communities are, they are in the southern states. It\u2019s generally the folks that are migrating from north to south.","So I don\u2019t know that anything abnormal is going on within that segment, other than it is a segment that I think is highly sensitive to consumer sentiment and consumer confidence levels. We actually saw that get stronger as we move through the quarter. So I\u2019d expect to probably see some added strength from that buyer group as we move in to the first quarter.","As far as, demand and has it been pulled forward? I don\u2019t believe that. I believe that as we move through the quarter, we saw some choppiness. There was certainly some choppiness and consumer sentiment and consumer confidence lag if you will and maybe even a little bit of a vacuum that was created around the time of the election. ","I think once we got pass the election, things started to at least calm and folks had a little bit clear picture of what their future might have looked like. We\u2019ve seen as we talked to our operators and we listen to what\u2019s going on our sales offices. We\u2019re seeing good consumer sentiment and I think that\u2019s a positive thing for not only us, but the entire industry. ","We saw a little bit of an uptick in interest rates, we talked about that. We don\u2019t see that dampening overall demand or desire to purchase, and we\u2019re optimistic about what prospects are for Q1. ","Stephen East","And then if you look at the returns and just a couple of questions around this. Are you more focused on ROE or ROIC? And then as you look at the variety of drivers, I know you\u2019ve touched in a variety of ways. But when you look at all the potential drivers, could link order sort of your focus if you will from incremental volumes, pricing, controlling your SG&A to I know it\u2019s all of those things. But I\u2019m trying to understand how you all think about pulling the levers the most aggressively to hit your ROIC or ROE targets?","Ryan Marshall","Stephen, we underwrite ROIC, so that\u2019s the metric that we pay attention to. I think ROE is certainly interesting and something that we look at, but is not the metric that we underwrite to, its\u2019 ROIC. In terms of the levers, I think it\u2019s difficult to say there\u2019s a one size fits all strategy. Every single transaction is a little bit different depending on the price point, the buyer group, the nature of the land transaction. ","We do and we are making different decisions on a case by case basis to maximize margin. Sometimes it\u2019s more price less volumes, sometimes it\u2019s more volume less price, because that\u2019s ultimately what\u2019s going to turn the asset and drive the returns that we\u2019re looking for. ","I would tell you that we have made a pivot in the way that we are looking at this. Historically we were probably heavily focused on margin as being the primary driver, and we\u2019re leading the organization to have more of a balance and make the appropriate decisions on pace and price to get the intended outcome. ","Operator","The next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner","Ryan I appreciate your comments on the demands, recent trends there and it\u2019s good to hear that deposits outlook and doesn\u2019t appear to any impact from higher so far. I guess just adding on to that line of questioning, your backlog conversion was very strong, this quarter it came in above your guidance. ","I know you are not a big spec builder, but I was curious if through the quarter as rates started to move and may be in to January, have you seen any evidence of buyers looking to buy more spec homes or homes that are closer to that delivery date to mitigate a potential continued increase in rates, or has the demand pattern between to be built and spec remain pretty constant over that time period? ","Ryan Marshall","We haven\u2019t seen a huge shift in demand Alan, and frankly we haven\u2019t altered our spec strategy. So if we go back a year ago, we introduced more spec in to our overall production pipeline than what we had been say two years ago or three years ago. We\u2019re still running at a fairly low rate, and as Bob mentioned we\u2019ve got just over 600 thinner specs which is less than one per community which is the number that we target. ","We are still introducing specs in to our system because it helps with production, it helps to even out a production flow with our trade partners and when we can provide them with consistency of work, that\u2019s a good thing. We want to keep our trade partners busy and on our job sites. ","As far as consumers go, I think anytime there is a threat or a talk of rates increasing it does create a little bit of urgency if you will to make a buying decision buy a spec, lock an [array], get a loan closed. ","As I mentioned the fact that we\u2019re still at a very historically low rate that all still works to the buyers favor at the end of the day. So we didn\u2019t see a noticeable shift between spec and to be built. ","Alan Ratner","And second question, you made the comments about labor and keeping your trades busy. I was down in Texas last week and one concern that some big builders down there have is that there is a big pretty migrant workforce base specifically shows up around this time of the year ahead of the selling season and some of these builders were just concerned given all the uncertainty on the immigration policy and the rhetoric that we might approach February and those workers may just not show up. ","So I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve had recent conversations with your trades. Is that a concern you are hearing on the labor front or has your workforce remained pretty steady and as such are not overly concerned about that? ","Ryan Marshall","Our labor remains tight, but we\u2019re managing very affectively with the labor that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve got very strong relationships with our trade partners and our division teams are purchasing procurement agents, our division presidents, our VPs of construction. Our folks on the ground I think have done an outstanding job in managing and maintaining those really strong relationships with vendors that frankly have a stable supply of labor. ","As far as what\u2019s going to happen with immigration policy, I think we\u2019re watching like everybody in the entire country. There\u2019s not just our company, not just our industry, I think everybody is looking at what\u2019s going to happen with some of the policies out of the new administration. Immigration is just one of those topics that we\u2019re paying attention to.","Operator","The next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG","Jack Micenko","Wanted to understand what\u2019s different in your thinking on the margin outlook for \u201917 compared to the fourth quarter. You had a nice beat in the fourth quarter, and I think the Wieland drag should be lifted going in to next year. So wondering what\u2019s behind the commentary towards the lower end?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yeah Jack, I guess it\u2019s really a reiteration of what we talked about a little while ago. We\u2019ve got higher land, we\u2019ve higher labor and we knew most of that 90 days ago, but certainly the interest rate increase and the impact on affordability factors in to that. So just on balance, our expectation is that we\u2019ll be at that lower end. There are still very high margins and always worth it to reiterate, we don\u2019t underwrite the margins, we underwrite the return. And we think it will be return accretive as well. ","Ryan Marshall","And Jack I\u2019d just add, the guidance that we gave a quarter ago was 24 to 24.5. We\u2019re reiterated that guidance. We have steered towards the lower end of it just based on what we\u2019re seeing in our backlog and some of the other factors that we anticipate in 2017. Our expectations for cost increases both labor and house are in the 1.5% to 2% for 2017, which we see is very reasonable. ","So to Bob\u2019s point, we have a lot of communities cycling out, a lot of communities cycling in, somewhere on the order of about 250 out and 250 new come in. So as we work through that, we look at the different margin profiles that\u2019s how we\u2019ve come up with our estimates and we tried to provide good transparency and communication to you all to help with the way you build your models. ","Jack Micenko","And I think in your prepared you\u2019d said, discounts 90 bps higher year-to-year, 40 bps quarter-to-quarter did I hear it right? And then second, the quarter-to-quarter numbers are almost half the year. Is there a common thread there or is that may be trying to offset some of the movement in interest rate. It looks like mortgage rates are up above that much in the fourth quarter. Just curious what was driving the change there?","Ryan Marshall","Yeah Jack I think it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. I certainly think some of it may have been interest rate related. We also had probably slightly, we had a few more specs going in to the fourth quarter than we generally run at and we know just from buyer behavior the margin profile on a home that\u2019s done and sitting on the ground. This is not as robust as one where a customer can pick out everything that they want to pick out, the way they want to do it. So that\u2019s probably a combination of both of those things. And Bob I don\u2019t know if you got anything else you\u2019d add to that? ","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yeah, the only thing I\u2019d add Jack is 3.1% in the current quarter, it\u2019s a little over $12,000 a unit, so it is still moderate on relative terms. So to all the points that Ryan made it\u2019s not like we\u2019re seeing it go up to 7% or something like that. ","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer. You may proceed.","James P. Zeumer","Thanks, Frances. This is Jim Zeumer, Vice President, Investor Relations for PulteGroup, and I want to thank everyone for participating in today's call to discuss our second quarter 2012 financial results. On the call today are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Schweninger, Vice President and Controller. Before we begin, copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted on our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today's call will also be available on the site later today. Also, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including references to gross margins reflecting certain adjustments, are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the press release and as an appendix to the calls' presentation deck.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me call -- turn the call over to Richard Dugas for a few opening comments. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that PulteGroup's second quarter financial results demonstrates significant year-over-year gains across a number of critical areas of our operations, including sign-ups, gross and operating margins and most importantly, earnings. Maybe equally compelling, our second quarter numbers also point to the opportunities for additional increases in the future. After a tremendous amount of hard work, our second quarter earnings mark a clear milestone in PulteGroup's effort to deliver consistent operating earnings and a much improved fundamental homebuilding performance. You've heard us discuss that a comprehensive analysis of our operations identified fundamental improvements we needed to make to deliver better operating results and in turn, higher returns on invested capital and higher returns for our shareholders. Known internally as our value creation work, the underlying initiatives have been focused on expanding margins, realizing greater overhead leverage, accelerating inventory turns and allocating capital more effectively. Along with the market tailwind the industry has enjoyed this year, our second quarter earnings of $0.11 per share also reflect progress we are making in implementing various value creation initiatives. While still in the early stages, we are starting to see an impact from programs designed to enhance revenue realization, as well as those focused on lowering construction costs. Although it can be tough to isolate, our second quarter adjusted margin of 20.3% shows the positive impact from initiatives we continue to advance, and which include the following: first, a strategic pricing program we have been rolling out where we are moving to more of a base house offering enhanced by an expanded list of options and upgrades that enable buyers to select the features they most value. Along with new pricing practices to capture higher lot premiums, our expanded option strategy is more consumer-friendly, while providing greater margins than our previous practices, a win-win. Second, benefits for our value engineering and\/or should cost activity to lower construction costs are gaining traction. Given the timeline to build and close homes, we estimate that fewer than 10% of second quarter closings benefited from this work, but we are very encouraged about the progress we're making. Going forward, the unit volumes that will have profited from this work will certainly increase, and become an ongoing source of opportunities to lower construction costs and\/or enhance margins. And finally, I would note that continued re-weighting of our operations toward more pre-sales with tighter controls around spec production in general and finished specs in particular. At quarter end, finished specs totaled only 600 homes, which is a drop of 50% from last year and equates to less than 1 finished spec unit per community. We have discussed that the discounting, which is often required to sell a finished spec can lower margins by several hundred basis points, which is magnifying when there are more specs on the ground. Along with positive margin and cash flow implications, limited spec production can help our community sell from a position of strength rather than a let's-make-a-deal mindset. Limited spec inventory also takes us closer to matching production with actual demand rather than trying to force volume through the system at any margin.","In addition to second quarter success we realized in growing margins, we're also able to improve our performance through increase overhead leverage, as SG&A in the period fell to 12.1% of home sale revenues. The combination of gains resulted in an operating margin increase of more than 600 basis points for the quarter. Our focus on driving better long-term returns is also evident within this quarter's strong 32% increase in year-over-year sign-ups, as these were generated from 7% fewer communities. With 125,000 lots under control, we do not have to chase land deals in the market, which is allowing us to be disciplined in our land investment.","We can and clearly did get our fair share of buyer demand in the quarter, but did so while being disciplined in our allocation of capital and investment back into the business. In the short-term, this capital discipline enabled us to be cash flow positive for both Q1 and Q2. And over the long term, such discipline is critical to generating higher overall returns on invested capital. As we have discussed, we entered 2012 operating under the assumption that new home sales in the U.S. would be flat with 2011. We have been pleasantly surprised as demand throughout the selling season and extending into these initial weeks of July has exceeded our expectations. In some areas, demand may even be a little overheated, as start dates are getting pushed out too far. So in select communities, we are purposely constraining sales. Again, such actions are not widespread, but it is a dramatic change from just a year ago. Although demand for new homes has accelerated in 2012, I think it's worth noting that many of the macro drivers of demand really haven't changed all that much. Unemployment remains above 8% and many experts place the real number much higher. The most recent consumer sentiment number showed meaningful weakness with most of the overall decline being in how consumers view future prospects for the national economy. Interest rates have been low for a long time and while they continue to drift lower, you have to wonder how much of an incremental impact this really has, and there are growing concerns over singular events ranging from the European meltdown to fiscal cliffs.","Given this backdrop, you might well ask, \"Why is the new housing market stronger?\" Along with low interest rates, higher rental lease cost and several years of pent-up demand, we believe that the most significant driver of the industry's success in 2012 is the low level of home inventory available to prospective buyers. Consumers do not have a lot of choices, as many of the newer existing homes are often in the wrong location while older homes are not always in great condition. A check of the month's supply of homes in many of today's stronger markets shows a large drop in available new and resale inventory over the past several quarters. With large investors continuing to acquire homes for conversion into rental properties, traditional homebuyers grow increasingly enticed by the advantages of buying in the new home market.","As we have discussed in our first quarter investor call, this is causing potential buyers to have a greater sense of urgency and an increasing fear of loss that a home not purchased today may not be there tomorrow. While urgency and fear of loss are important, over the long term, sustaining the recovery in housing will require an improving economy and greater job creation. Given all the market positives ranging from mortgage rates at historic lows and homes priced at compelling values, to the innovative new floor plans we are offering, we are very optimistic about housing demand. That being said, we're keeping a watchful eye on the macro trends, which ultimately need to turn more positive for the recovery to expand further. Now let me turn the call over to Bob who will offer additional insights and details on our second quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard. PulteGroup reported significantly improved operating and financial results in the quarter, which combined with our first quarter results, leave us well-positioned for the rest of the year and on-track to report full year profitability. While the market has helped, we are particularly pleased with the operational improvements that are being driven in the areas of focus and by the key business initiatives we've been discussing for the past year. Total sign-ups in the period were 5,578 homes, which represents an increase of 32% over last year. As Richard mentioned, this strong increase in Q2 sign-ups was realized from 7% fewer communities.","Looking further at our sign-ups, we generated higher year-over-year sign-ups in each brand, but continue to see a shift in mix to our move-up or Pulte brand. During the quarter, sign-ups by brand were 27% for Centex; 48%, Pulte; and 25%, Del Webb, which compares to 33% for Centex, 41% for Pulte and 26% for Del Webb in the first quarter of this year.","Looking at our first quarter results, home sale revenues were just over $1 billion, an increase of 14% compared with last year. The increase in revenue is driven by an 8% increase in average selling price to $268,000 combined with a 5% increase in closings to 3,816 homes. During the first quarter, our mix of closings included 33% from Centex, 42% from Pulte, and 25% from Del Webb. In the prior year, the closing mix was 39%, Centex; 34%, Pulte; and 27%, Del Webb. The increase in our average selling price reflects the continued shift in our product mix from the first-time buyer towards the move-up buyer. I would also point out that we continue to strategically prove [ph] our land portfolio. In the second quarter, we generated land proceeds of $9 million. We recorded a net gain of $1 million in connection with those sales. In the last 4 quarters, we've generated land sales proceeds of approximately $125 million.","Turning to our margins, slide 6 of our webcast slide shows that our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 20.3%. This represents an increase of 320 basis points over the second quarter of 2011. Importantly, our Q2 adjusted margins were also up 160 basis points from the first quarter of this year. As Richard mentioned, we believe that our value creation initiatives contributed to our strong margin performance and our second quarter margins also benefited from an increase in closings from newer communities. Land-related impairments during the quarter were approximately $3 million.","Looking at our overhead, total SG&A for the quarter was $124 million or 12.1% of home sale revenues. This represents a $14 million decrease from the second quarter of last year, when SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 15.4%. As you can see in this morning's earnings release, our Financial Services operations continued to perform at a high level, generating pretax income of $16 million in the quarter. This quarter's performance is driven primarily by a 17% increase in loan origination volumes due to the increased activity in our homebuilding operations, coupled with the continuing favorable interest rate environment. Financial Services generated a $17 million loss in the second quarter of 2011, which included a $19 million charge related to our mortgage repurchase exposure.","As noted on Slide 11 of our webcast slides, gross repurchase requests for the most recent quarter continued to move between 100 and 150 requests per month, which is consistent with the volumes we have been seeing for the past 3 quarters.  I'd like to provide a couple of other data points related to Financial Services before we move on. In the quarter, we originated 2,603 loans, which compares to 2,217 loans last year. The increase in originations in the period reflects the increased volume from homebuilding, as well as an increase in our capture rate to 82%, which compares to 77% in 2011. On a consolidated basis, our reported net income was $42 million or $0.11 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash, which is up $96 million from the first quarter of 2012. Our improved cash position resulted from a number of factors, including the more efficient use of our capital by our homebuilding operations for land acquisition and development, our land asset sales, as well as the reduction in the level of our spec home inventory. We've been talking about our desire to reduce our investment in spec homes inventory. Such reduced investment improves our working capital and protects our margins. As Richard noted, we reduced our finished spec inventory by approximately 50% from last year. That's only part of the story. We've been able to reduce our total spec unit count by 46% from last year. As a result, we have freed up approximately $120 million from investment in house inventory. On top of the benefits we've talked about, we were able to use this cash to fund investment in-house we are making related to the increasing level of to-be-built sales.","In addition, we're extremely pleased with how our capital allocation process and related disciplines are developing. We believe they are putting the company in a position to invest in land and related development, so that we can continue to enhance our position in the market, while at the same time enabling us to generate enough cash to reduce our aggregate debt levels.","I would now like to cover a couple of other second quarter data points. We ended the quarter with 744 active communities, down 7% from last year and consistent with the first quarter of 2012. At quarter end, we have a total of 7,560 homes in backlog valued at $2.2 billion, representing increases of 31% and 37% respectively compared to last June. We ended the quarter with 6,400 homes under construction, of which 75% were sold and only 25% were spec. And we have previously indicated that we expected to invest approximately $800 million in land and land development spend this year. Based on our sales activity, we now expect to accelerate certain land purchases and development spend. As a result, we now expect to spend slightly in excess of $900 million on land and land development. Beyond this incremental investment in the business, we continue to evaluate the use of cash with a strategic focus on reducing our overall debt levels and shrinking the size of our balance sheet.","In conclusion, we're extremely pleased with our second quarter profitability and the overall strong operating and financial results we've reported for the period. Our strategies and tactics are enabling us to meet near-term operational goals and to position the company for long-term success.","Before turning the call over to Richard, I want to take a moment to address recent questions we've gotten about our mortgage repurchase reserves. As you may be aware, a number of regional banks recently recorded increased repurchase reserves, indicating that the increases are prompted in part by information provided to them through conversations with one or both of the GSEs. Given the questions being asked, we thought it would make sense to review again the information we've provided related to our mortgage repurchase exposure.","Looking at Slide 10 of our webcast materials, we've included the origination data we originally included in our webcast materials in Q3 of 2011 for reference. You may recall that we indicated last year that more than 80% of our repurchase requests related to originations in 2006 and 2007, and that we cure or refute more than 60% of the repurchase requests we receive. We also noted last year that we had received an insignificant number of repurchase requests related to the brokered, government and bridge loans. As a result, we indicated that the majority of our repurchase requests are driven by approximately $25 billion of originations in '06 and '07. We also noted that the origination values did reflect any repayment, refinance or loan modification activity. In the last 9 months, the unpaid principal balance will have been further reduced. We have had dialogue with each of the investors that bought the vast majority of the originations in question. As of today, we have not received any information which has caused us to amend our reserve estimates. Now let me turn the call back over to Richard.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. As is our practice, before opening the call to questions, let me provide some additional color on the market conditions we experienced during the second quarter. With a 32% increase in sign-ups, it won't come as much of a surprise when I say that most of our markets showed solid improvement during the quarter. Demand up and down the East Coast remains strong in the period. We continue to experience exceptional demand in our New England market, which we think reflects gains driven by new communities we've opened in the Greater Metro Boston area for the past few quarters. In other markets, demand through Northern Virginia, Georgia, the Carolinas and into Florida also remain strong.","Moving toward the middle of the country, the modest pickup in midwest demand that we noted in the first quarter continued and even accelerated into the second quarter. Michigan continues to be an amazing story, as the local economy has once again rallied in response to the much improved auto industry. Only Chicago continues to struggle, but even that market seems to have bottomed. That isn't to say a Chicago recovery is in sight, but the market seems to be moving sideways rather than down. We also saw noticeable gains for our Texas operations in the quarter, as those economies remain a bright spot for the country. And finally, out west, demand remains strong across the markets with sustained high rates of demand in Arizona, Nevada and both Southern and Northern California. A number of the communities in these markets are where we have been seeing the highest rates of demand, and have been taking action to ensure that we don't get too far out on our start dates. Given the demand trends through the first couple of quarters, I would say that we are seeing an expanded opportunity to raise price in a growing number of markets. Pricing may not be available in every community in each market, but in our well-located communities, our operators are looking to move prices higher.","Just to wrap-up before questions, there are a lot of positives within today's earnings announcement: profitability for the quarter, which we expect will continue for the year; growth in orders exceeding 30%; meaningful margin expansion at both the gross and operating lines; and positive cash flow for the quarter, which will ultimately support our ability to invest in the business while still delevering our balance sheet going forward. To paraphrase the old expression, the harder we work, the luckier we get. We are indeed benefiting from improved market conditions, but our employees have worked hard to adopt new processes and implement new practices which will enable future gains, gains which can be accelerated through a broader market recovery. In closing, I would like to thank our entire organization for their hard work. I would also like to take a minute to recognize our Georgia operations and our trade partners in that market who have donated their time and materials for a very special project called Aimee's Wing. We are very proud of your efforts. Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Frances, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great quarter on the reduced -- great orders on the great -- on the reduced community count, by the way. On that, I was hoping to get a little bit of color on the drivers of the North as well as the Southeast and Florida in terms of leading the kind of the range of results. In Florida, as we've heard a lot of strength there, I know you've kind of paired some of your assets and you have a -- the Tampa asset and maybe just kind of review your positioning in Florida, but color on these 3 regions.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, it's Richard. Thanks for your comments. Here's what I would say, in the first quarter, the strength was primarily Florida, mid-Atlantic, Arizona, et cetera. I think in Q2, it accelerated to more of the rest of the country. Our North areas, we've been putting some additional investment in place, which has helped, Michigan as an example. Believe it or not, even though we don't have a huge investment in Michigan, it's really been a source of strength for us, so that helped in that market. The Southeast, gosh, all I can say is steady as she goes with continued improvement in most markets. Florida continues to be excellent and you didn't mention the Southwest, which is probably our strongest market in terms of overall demand level. So we're very pleased with what we've seen through the quarter, handily beating our expectations.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And second, just on pricing, you mentioned expanded opportunity to raise price in many markets. I was hoping to get a sense of number one, how you felt pricing progressed, let's say, company average across the company, across all of your communities? We've heard pricing may be up, let's say, on an effective basis, up 1% to 2% year-to-date for most builders and I'm talking about orders here. Is that kind of what you've been seeing greater or lesser and thoughts as we go into the back half of the year?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, I don't think I'll comment on a specific number. But here's what I will tell you, with regard to pricing, we have had a pricing initiative in place for some time that's helped us on options as well as lot premiums to capture frankly more price, if you will, in a different sense through those areas. We have seen that, but we've also seen an acceleration in our ability to raise base price in more markets than we certainly were earlier in the year. You may have noted in the commentary we purposely slowed sales in some of our markets and frankly, when doing that, we're partly doing that with price and still pleased with the results we're getting. So I wouldn't put a specific number on it, but I would say it varied across the company, depending on which market you're in, but the general trend is very positive for pricing.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bob, you talked about the put back, that was a helpful explanation. Could you do 2 things? Could you explain what that $27 billion is that you're not really seeing any put backs on and then what type of loss rate you are seeing on the other part of your business?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, the things -- so what we -- brokered loans, for instance, where we didn't keep the rep and warrant is a good example and on government originations, we're not seeing much exposure, if any. So that's the piece of the portfolio that we're saying we don't see much risk in. And in terms of the others where we do see some risk, again, what I would point you to is, yes, we see a fairly consistent stream of requests. It varies in terms of where the originations were in terms of how much money per loan and again, we haven't given a whole lot of color on that over time. But for the repurchase requests that we're receiving currently, we're not seeing a change in the content of them really. The drivers of our exposure haven't changed much it seems.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if we look at what you all have been seeing on getting back to the homebuilding in the first half of the year, construction costs, I know you don't really have land purchase costs, but construction costs and the value engineering where you talked about only 10% of your volume is going through that now, what type of margin differential you have on that? And then the other thing is cash flow being positive typical in the first and second quarters of the year.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, I'll start, Steven, it's Richard, and then throw it to Bob for some commentary maybe on cost. In terms of the value engineering work that we're doing, the 10% commentary was to try to get everyone sensitized to the fact that as we redo our floor plans, it takes some time. Obviously, you have to get that done and you have to get those homes sold. We typically have homes in backlog anywhere from 3 to 8 or 9 months. So by the time the closings come through, the 10% number is only going to go up from here. So our point there was we got more good news where that's coming from. The differential in terms of margins from that can be substantial, and that's part of what we're seeing in terms of our margin growth and even though it's a small percentage today of that stream of work. A comment on cash flow, we typically are not cash flow positive in Q1 and Q2, but that was before we got a lot more disciplined with regard to our capital allocation. And I'll just point to everyone on the call that not only do we feel great about our cash flow, we also feel good about the business environment, and we're going to invest a little over $100 million incrementally in the business this year versus what we're planning as a result of what we're seeing in the business, while still maintaining positive cash flow and our ability to delever. So we feel extremely good about that. Bob, he had a question, I think, on cost a little bit.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Sure, the construction cost we've seen, consistent, I think, with what we said at the end of the first quarter. We are seeing a little bit of pressure on things like lumber not outside what we expected. In some of the hotter markets, we're starting to see some material cost increase, so for example, concrete, but again, not huge differentials. What we are experiencing, I think, is a shortage of labor in certain markets, and that's going to start to pressure pricing we think. So in certain markets, we've granted some price increases on labor, and so again that's in the markets that are relatively hot right now. So again, for base commodity type costs, consistent with what we saw coming into the year. We have seen drywall stay where it -- is at higher level than last year, but again, not a huge cost component of the house. So overall, not meaningful increases. But again, the watch out is as labor tightens, we could see some price pressure there.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can just elaborate a bit more and talk about the shift in terms of to more options, aways from standard and such, how -- what are you learning in terms of a better sense of what customers want in the homes and what they're willing to pay for, and how significantly do you think that could be in terms of the impact on the margins there?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Dan, this is Richard. Frankly, we've done a tremendous amount of research recently, and I would tell you our insight into consumer wants is significantly enhanced from where it was even just a year ago. What we're finding is that the buyer wants the ability to personalize their home, and our previous practices of a few years ago where we're loading up a home with a lot of things was not necessarily what the buyers want. Some people want a base home and maybe 4 or 5 options. Others want to personalize their home with a lot more. We now also internally have visibility to the actual drivers of gross margin. As an example, we can break out for ourselves what we're selling in options, what we're doing in discounts to a much greater degree than we did before, and we are seeing substantial pickups in many markets from that. It's hard to isolate a given number and give you a particular number, but I can tell you it was a mover of margins in the quarter, and I would tell you it will continue to be as people select these options.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I guess, in terms of the mortgage conversations because you talked about conversations and dialogue with the investors, just want to clarify and understand it. Were you talking about recent conversations? Is there anything in terms of something more recent that were just more in general you've been having this conversations. I was trying to understand if that's something that we should be expecting more resolution on going forward or if it's just more ongoing dialogue there.","Richard J. Dugas","Well, we obviously have dialogue with these folks all the time. We do business with them. In terms of resolutions of these, I don't think there's anything for us to report at this time.","Operator","Your next audio question is from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two sets of questions. First questions relate to your comment about certain markets getting a little overheated. The reason why I wanted to ask you about this is because as good as your results have been and as dramatic as the improvement has been, probably, what's most interesting or captivating for investors is the potential for this to continue to grow at extremely strong rates for quite some time because you're still at a very depressed level. And so one of the things that I would love to hear you talk about is your ability to maintain very strong, like 30%, 40% type growth top line going forward, let's say, over the next 2 years. So in that vain, you made this comment that certain of your communities are overheated and you were intentionally slowing things down. So putting those 2 things together, I'm trying to understand, can you give us a sense for what you think your company's maximum growth rate that you're prepared to allow your communities to experience is? Are we talking 50% on a compounded annual basis for the next 2 to 3 years? Or is that level really not reasonable for a bunch of practical reasons that -- within your operations?","Richard J. Dugas","Steve, there's a lot loaded in that question. Let me try to break it down a little bit. I think you have to look at the individual communities and the individual markets. As an example, everybody knows we have a lot of inventory on the ground in terms of lots in our Del Webb communities. We would probably be willing to let our Del Webb communities run quite a bit, and potentially a very substantial number of incremental units could be sold there purposely. On the other hand, we have lots of communities, say, for the Pulte brand and even for the Centex brand, where we have limited lot supply. And given our desire to generate cash and delever and selectively reinvest, we would feel on a community like that, it would be a lot smarter to drive price, which is of course what we're doing in some of these overheated situations that I mentioned. I would also point out that the market over all, I would say, is likely to be a little bit labor-constrained as the demand comes back. So from kind of running a smart business in our opinion, it might not be smart to let your backlog run out a year ahead or 15 months ahead. And frankly in a few markets, we could have done that in Q2 and we decided not to. We'd rather take the price. We'd rather take the margin. We're at a 75% presale versus spec mix. We're extremely proud of that and frankly, we think that provides us not only cash flow benefits, but also margin benefits, et cetera. So I'm not trying to dodge your question. It's hard to answer. Do we think business can accelerate and revenue can improve from here? Absolutely. Is that our key goal? No. Our key goal is to drive higher returns and kind of run each community smartly, so I hope that helps.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, it does. But let me follow-up on that. For example, I understand what you're saying at a community level, but there are certain communities where the land is -- you have a certain constraint within that community. On the other hand, my guess would be that in -- when have a community like that, you probably have some near neighbor communities that maybe are not yet open. And so while you may not want to burn through a very successful community today, it would seem that one possibility would be that you would in that market, open up more communities, some which are maybe not quite so well-positioned, but at least you have excess lots in that market. But your commentary about the ability to get subcontractors onto the job site, that suggests that maybe that solution is not really a solution and so therefore, in these markets, slowing things down really is the best option that you have. Can you help me understand in situations where you have a very successful community, you don't want to blow through it. Is there the ability to open up more communities? Are you aggressively trying to do that, so that the net result from a corporate perspective is that you are able to actually continue to grow at a very accelerated rate?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Steve, we certainly put our fair share in new lots under control and our desire is to take advantage of those market opportunity by investing. And I would tell you, I guess, the general answer to your question is we want to drive the highest ROIC that we can. That's our goal is return on invested capital. So we've got to analyze it community by community. In some situations, it's going to be opening up a new community like you suggested and driving volume. In other situations, it's going to be a real focus on margin. And we've been so, so pleased with our efforts to drive higher margin. We think we have more where that's coming from. I would say our company's bias is going to be more in that direction. I'll just again point you back to the spec comment. We don't have a lot of excess inventory anymore in a given quarter to capture. We're matching production to demand. We like where our backlog is headed overall. So for us, perhaps, not as much of a focus on volume as you might be suggesting, but we're quite confident that we'll continue to drive better results than we have in the past by being more disciplined about how we're running the business versus just the push on volume, which I know was our focus years ago.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Richard, looking at the first half of the year, obviously, you've put together terrific results. If you look at demand in the first quarter, better than fourth quarter of last year. Second quarter, further acceleration in demand and even some pricing power. Obviously, you've talked about your internal initiatives as well. Now if I listen to what concerns investors at this stage, so looking into the second half of the year, how can housings momentum continue given risks of a recession or I think you called them some discrete event elsewhere, coming and spilling onto our shores and maybe affecting job growth. If I judge from your comments, your comments on the macro as well as your -- increasing your land spend from the $800 million, it sounds as though you have some confidence that the pace of housing recoveries momentum can continue. So I just wanted to dig in to that a little bit. What gives you that confidence that housing recoveries momentum can be sustained in light of all the challenges that face us?","Richard J. Dugas","Nishu, part of the confidence is the fact that we're still in a country selling a preposterously low number of loans relative to historical trends. I don't believe for a second people really want to rent the rest of their life. I think they want to own. And so you've got a certain amount of momentum from people that want to get off the fence, and there's a growing sense that pricing has bottomed and that I better get in while the getting's good. I do think that can carry us quite a ways, but our commentary was designed to help say that in order for housing to really take a big leg up from here, we are going to need job growth at some point, and we were kind of pointed in our script commentary around the fact that we believe low levels of inventory is driving the majority of the good results we're seeing. We certainly think that can continue from here. Can housing double or triple from these levels just on the backs of low inventory? My guess is no. It probably needs a stronger economy to come along. So we're just trying to be balanced in our overall outlook there. Having said that, I want to be very clear. We are optimistic about the balance of this year and into next year, if for no other reason, then there's a whole bunch of people that have been sitting on the sidelines that want to get in. I think we can take housing higher from here. The question is how high and gosh, I don't know. I would tell you this, we're more focused on running a good business internally, and are very confident that no matter what the housing market brings, that our operational act is together now.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Now that's very helpful. Second question, just shifting gears a bit to the Centex brand. So since the acquisition, obviously, at the outset, there were some shifting of communities between brands, repositioning them. But since then, even it seems as though the Centex share of your communities has continued to decline, the Centex branded share of communities. So I was wondering what is the future for Centex? I mean, it seems as though there's been more success in the midrange or the move-up buyer. So should we expect the share of Centex communities to continue to decline or at some stage, is there going to be a turnaround maybe some more reinvestment in the Centex-branded type communities?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Nishu, it's Richard again. It is true that most of our recent investment has been into the Pulte brand, and the Centex brand has accounted for a smaller piece. Having said that, we are hard at work at a new product line we're calling the Independent series of homes, which is a very value-based proposition for that entry-level buyer. I can't predict exactly what the percentage is going to be in the future, but it is not our intention to not reinvest in the Centex brand. Said a different a way, we're very bullish on the entry-level buyer over the long run and we've learned a great deal in the last couple of years about that entry-level consumer. And we continue to rollout new communities and new different service offerings, as an example in our mortgage advisor product, as well as a new retail center concept that we're offering for that buyer category that are very exciting over time. It's just going to take a little bit of time for that to show up in results. So over the near term, I think you're going to continue to see a weighting toward the Pulte brand primarily, but we intend to continue to invest in Centex.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Joshua Pollard from Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Would love for you guys to walk through the normal seasonality of your particular business. Many understand how the market moves, but can you manage -- but you guys can manage the business in deliveries by quarter and by months, so can you tell us what normal seasonality on an orders per community looks like in the third and fourth quarter of a standard year? And then dig in a little bit into July, order growth in comparison to that?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Joshua, this is Richard. A couple of things. First of all, I would say that the second quarter, we saw a fairly typical pattern as volumes were slightly lower as we moved through the period, and the selling season wound down. In terms of the balance of the year, of course, I have no idea exactly what's going to happen. But typically, we would sell in the range of 60% to 65% of our overall volume in the first half of the year and the balance in the second half. I see no reason why that normal seasonality will not continue to play out this year. So I would expect overall volumes through the balance of the year to trail down from what we've seen, as I indicated in our comments earlier. However, the first few weeks of July are still above our expectations, which is a positive thing. So I think the overall level of demand for new housing this year is clearly up fairly dramatically from last year, but I do think it will follow a fairly typical seasonal pattern.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Exploring the land and gross margin dynamic versus other builders, so other builders have pitched that they have been purchasing, have a higher share of newer communities that's driving certainly some of their growth. I think for you, and you can certainly highlight how many closings came from new communities, but it's far below others given, Richard, in the past, you've talked about liking your land, which is going to be my second question. But what do you think is really driving -- you talked about the price, the incentives, but within the absence of gross margins coming from new communities, you're still getting better gross margin trends, which are -- do include commissions. So it's kind of surprising. I mean, is it just the fact that your construction side is better because you're seeing such a huge piece from new communities which other builders really are focusing on.","Richard J. Dugas","Ken, I very much appreciate you pointing that out. We thought for quite a long time that the reality of our performance the next number of years was going to largely be driven by the large land bank that we already have, and whatever we're able to reinvest certainly will be good and new investment will help and Mike can give you some community countdown on that in just a moment. But the lion's share of our performance is going to be driven by our existing business and frankly, we're not surprised at what we're seeing because we've been hard at work. Late 2010, we underwent a real deep dive into how to drive value in this business and we felt like we were leaving a lot of margin on the table. So yes, our construction practices, what we call value engineering, our focus on something we call should costing, and don't discount these strategic pricing initiatives I mentioned. We're being much smarter frankly with how we're handling options and lot premiums in addition to whatever we can get from the market momentum in lift of base price. So I -- if I sound bullish for the future, that's why I am, it's because it's driven off of what we already have. So with that, maybe Mike can give some color in terms of the new communities.","Michael J. Schweninger","Ken, it's Mike. In the quarter, about 20% of the closings were what we call from new communities and that's consistent with our expectations. It will trend up slightly for the year at around 25%.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Now I have a -- my follow-up question is about that new community as well as the -- your view on land finish supply, et cetera. The new communities, is that newly opened up from your legacy or from land that you purchased first? If you could highlight the amount of commissions you have in gross margin, I know some builders have been restating that, so it would make it a little clearer for everybody to understand. And then what's your view on land? I know you're buying some, but do you think you're -- given the long legacy land position, do you think in the gross margins you're seeing -- I mean, could stuff be coming in better than you might have marked it to?","Richard J. Dugas","So maybe Mike can give you a little commentary on the definition of new communities, and then I can help with the back piece.","Michael J. Schweninger","When we define a new community, a community that we have purchased after the Centex merger. So it would be anything that's specifically after that. Just real quick on the commission question, it's around 350 to 400 basis points commissions in total.","Richard J. Dugas","And so Ken, on your second piece, if I'm hearing it correctly, you're asking about our legacy positions in our -- how we market. In terms of our impairments over the past, we feel like we used the appropriate methodology for that overall. But we've been hard at work outside of what the land is marked to, to improve our results from sticks and bricks and operational side and that's beginning to come through. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything there.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, the only thing I'd say is that the model that we used to book impairments would put the post-impairment margins at actually a lower level, low- to mid-teens, whereas, we're underwriting transactions today with a higher margin requirement than that. So in terms of what we're seeing today, it's not being driven by prior impairments.","Operator","And your next question is a follow-up from the line of Joshua Pollard from Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to talk about the $100 million that you're investing in your business more than your original plan. Can you talk about what year you're building that for? I think one of the larger investor concerns is that you guys are buying land that inherently has lower margins than what you're currently reporting.","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I think, what we've seen is actually -- and because of the increase in sales, we're actually closing on transactions sooner, so the next take on an option transaction and development to put homes into production for '13 and '14. So it's actually the increased demand that we're seeing. And in terms of the recent vintage of acquisitions, I would say we are not expecting a decline in margins as a result of that at all. Our underwriting standards are at least the size what we're generating today, but focused on returns as opposed to margin.","Operator","And you next question is from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, Richard, getting to your comments on how the macro economy maybe isn't as cooperative, we're not really seeing a good -- a strong turn in the macro, and so do you think a lot of the benefits that we've seen in the new home market are being driven by inventory levels? I wanted to get an idea that -- considering you guys have more of -- you've moved more towards a risk-based pricing model when you think about buying land, how you think about risk associated with potentially pent-up inventory, if that make sense, especially in a market where you might be seeing home price appreciation, how can you factor that into your models?","Richard J. Dugas","David, we do our best not to factor in price appreciation in our models, and frankly, we've been criticized some in the past for being \"conservative\" with our land-buying practices maybe relative to some of our peers. We're okay with that to not get out ahead of ourselves. I mean, as I was answering an earlier question, the vast majority of our success or failure in the future is going to be from our legacy position. So I would tell you, I think, we're being smart about how we're buying land. Bob, feel free to comment there.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","The only thing I would add to that is we've talked about that we've got several criteria that we look at in terms of risk management. One of the things that actually factors into our consideration of land transactions today is what's the exit cost? So to your point, if there was excess supply that freed up, whether it's the shadow inventory, we would have expectations of what our exit would be in terms of leaving the transaction if the market got soft on us.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just as a follow-up question, obviously, very good profitability in the Financial Services business, some of which I know you talked about coming from leverage. What's the sustainability of that level of profitability? I mean, in our models, you're back kind of where you were when you were doing a lot more units effectively, in terms of the margins you're able to achieve. Is that pretty sustainable as we move forward and can you kind of talk about how that was achieved?","Richard J. Dugas","A lot of it is the interest rate environment, and it's a very select market. There is not a lot of competition. Pricing is favorable for us today. I don't know if that's sustainable over the long-term as -- if and when capital returns to that business, I think you would see margins contract. But until that happens, I think you'll continue to see this kind of performance.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","So just one on the capacity, Richard, it sounds like you're, along with other builders running up against being able to start these homes as quickly as you would otherwise like. In an industry where it's down, 60%, 70% in volumes, it's sounds kind of crazy that capacity is going to be a constraint. But how do you think that plays out over the next couple of quarters and into '13 as far as your ability to get back to what you had deemed to be a normal construction cycle?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Dennis, just to be clear, most of that is in the labor side, so I don't think there's much capacity trouble on the material side. But labor is an issue particularly for some of the unskilled trades, where they're just not as many people in the industry perform in that as in the past. I actually think it's a good thing. I think it will keep the market from getting too far out ahead of itself and frankly, plays in our hands cause we're so focused on margin improvement and higher returns today. Listen, work will find its way and money will find its way to where the opportunity is. So I don't expect it to be a big limiting factor over the long run. If business continues like we've seen at the first half of the year for much longer, you'll see other people coming back in. So could it put a temporary lid on how many homes could get built, perhaps, but I do think it would be temporary, Dennis. I don't see that lasting forever.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then another question, you mentioned, I think, it was under 10 that you had done the internal study, and sort of changed some of the metrics that you guys manage the business around. Now you had some time since that, how would you describe sort of the internal morale around these decisions and the change in strategy? Are the people that are in place today fully bought in or that's still a process?","Richard J. Dugas","I would say people are fully bought in today and it has taken some time overall, but nothing like results to get everybody excited. Frankly, the whole company's excited. This is our best financial performance in years, and we're doing a few high-fives internally and that generates momentum. So if anything, I think, if anything, I'd say, Dennis, people are excited and pleased that the opportunity is as big as we thought it was, and are excited to help drive it from here.","Operator","And your question is from the line of Will Randow from Citi.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just running some quick numbers. It seems like you might be not fully replenishing lands, but the $100 million increase. I could be wrong, but let me know. And I'm just curious what areas are you focusing in terms of that land spend and where do you think that lot supply is constrained?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Will, just as a general commentary, I don't know if Bob might have any more details he wants to add. But in terms of not kind of fully replenishing land, candidly, that's the whole point. We have too much dirt and we're doing our best. As we look at our balance sheet, not 100% of our balance sheet is driving our revenue today. We have a whole bunch of lots that are sitting that are not doing a lot for us. So our goal is to continue to pare down our land, while still being able to grow appropriately in the market overall. So yes, I think that's fair. I think we'd like to bring the size of our balance sheet down. I'd just like to point out for everyone that is looking at the numbers, we don't need this size balance sheet to drive this size business, and that's obviously going to be a big driver of improved returns over the long haul. Bob, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","No, I agree. Again, if you look at the year, we've changed our controlled lots. It's come down by about 6,000 lots. We have delivered 7,000 lots. So we're still in the game. We're still buying lots, but the goal is to try and drive that investment in land down.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It makes sense, and I was just thinking regarding constraining certain communities just because you don't want them to overheat, can you discuss how we should think about conversion rates and cancellation rates as well as demand in the second half?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, this is Richard. In terms of conversion rates, it's just for what it's worth with a 75% pre-sale business and 25% spec, we don't have as much inventory on the ground as we did to kind of have an outsized conversion rate in any given quarter. Our backlog is pretty robust right now for Q3 and Q4 frankly. So we're happy about that. In terms of cancellation rates, obviously, that's going to be a factor of what happens in the broader economy. We're very happy with where can rates are. They continue to be below the historical norms and no way to kind of predict that going forward. I don't know, Bob, if you have anything else or...","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","So I think that's our view, Will.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to circle back on some previous questions about the multi-year outlook and I wanted to tie that in into some of the details you provided on your orders by segment. If you adjusted those orders by segment like for your community count by segment, I was curious how that would look. I'm really asking the question in the context of what the strength is of the entry-level buyer right now and how important, Richard, you think that entry-level buyer is in terms of getting us back to a normal level of production in the context of elevated unemployment and difficult mortgage qualifying?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Listen, one of the reasons we like the multi-branded model is we don't have excess risk weighted into any one category. I will tell you that all 3 of our brands saw sign-up growth in the quarter and we do feel the entry-level category is an important segment. Having said that, I don't think it will come as a shock that if and when rates rise, that business is probably not going to perform as well as say the active adult buyer, which approximately half of pay cash. So from a long-term perspective, I think you can continue to expect a dominant weighting toward Pulte. The Del Webb business did pick-up nicely for us in Q2, which we think is a positive, but the Centex business was also good. We just didn't have as much investment in that category. So I didn't know, Adam, if I'm getting to the essence of your question.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The essence of the question, really, is that you guys have the best view of the full spectrum of buyers and it seems to suggest from your results that the better results are coming from the move-up luxury and the active adult, and I'm just curious if there's this group of buyers right now that consist of those -- that group that is driving the demand and if we don't see a real improvement in the macro economic fundamentals, we're going to exhaust those supply of buyers. I'm just curious what you think about the entry-level buyers coming back and what they need to come back and if they don't come back because of whatever issues, then how sustainable the recovery is?","Richard J. Dugas","I would suggest our results right now are more driven by our investment choices. In the past year to 18 months, we've been investing more in the Pulte brand and of course, on the Del Webb side, we haven't had to invest because we have a ton of lots there. So I would say that's the biggest driver is kind of how we've weighted it. And then secondarily, there does seem to be nice some strength in the Pulte side, but I'm not trying to suggest lack of strength in the entry-level. That's been more driven by the investment side.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, the only thing I'd add is, again, our community count makes the numbers a little bit confusing. If you look at just sales per community, what you would see is that sales per community on the first-time buyer are actually up over 30% for us versus the second quarter of last year, which isn't as quick an increase in pace, to Richards point, as the move-up buyer. But again, a fairly robust market, so they're out shopping. They still have the same issues in terms of can they put a down payment together, are they credit challenged, but they are a significant portion of what we're seeing today.","Operator","And at this time, we have time for one question and that comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up, just what -- sorry, if I missed it, but what was your cancellation rate in the quarter?","Richard J. Dugas","14%.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","14%. And then just as a follow-up to beat this dead horse in terms of your constrained demand. I guess, for those of us who have been following the industry for a while, I'm getting some flashbacks from years past, where a builder would say, \"Well, we're concentrating on price or margin\". And then the next quarter, you get a big mix in orders or you get -- you end up with a lot of spec. So I guess if you could kind of walk us through maybe processes you have in place or lesson learned, post tax credit, about how to manage this process where you're trying to raise price a little and not end up with too much spec or not end up with demand maybe coming in lower than you thought?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Megan, first of all, I don't think you have to worry too much about us having too much spec, unless we have a huge spike in can rate, which we do not forecast. We have a lot of discipline in the company around spec. For us, right now, it's about simple calculation around ROIC. And as much as I hate to admit this, in the past, it was more driven around volume. And so whatever provides the greatest return for us in a given community and a given division is what we're going to continue to focus on. So I don't want everyone to get carried away with this idea of constraining demand. It is in select markets that are very, very strong, candidly, Arizona, parts of Southern California, places like that. It's not everywhere we're constraining demand. We're just trying to run a smart business. And frankly, I would see here in '04 and '05 for the heyday, we're not talking about a market like that. What we're talking about is, I think, running a smarter business given what we see on the ground today, and just part of the equation candidly is our backlog. I personally am not comfortable carrying a backlog out for a year as an example. A 6 to 9 month backlog is very appropriate, and if we can continue to manage that versus how hand to mouth we were a few years ago as an industry, where we were dying for sales every single quarter, that's about right. We typically can project and protect our construction cost roughly out 6 months, that type of thing. So that's our view is to try to be balanced in that regard. So I hope that helps.","Operator","And I will now turn the call over to Jim Zeumer for your closing remarks.","James P. Zeumer","I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. We're certainly around for the remainder of the day. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be happy to take them and we look forward to talking to you on the next quarter.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir.","James Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Abby, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to this morning\u2019s call to discuss PulteGroup's fourth quarter 2018 operating and financial results. I'm joined on this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance.","The copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post the replay of today's call to our website a little later on. I want to highlight that as part of today's presentation call, we will be discussing our reported results as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning\u2019s release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results. ","Before I turn the call over to Ryan, I also want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the Company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.","The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. With our strong fourth quarter results now reported, we completed a very positive year in which we achieved critical operating and financial goals against with we measure the performance of our business. ","Included in the key metrics we track is our ability to invest in and purposely grow our business and we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls that we look to grow our business consistent with or slightly faster than the overall new home market. ","With 2018 closings up 10% to just over 23,000 homes, we achieved that objective last year. 10% more closings in combination with an 8% increase in average selling price allowed PulteGroup to drive an 18% or $1.5 billion gain in annual homebuilding revenues to $9.8 billion. ","Our 2018 revenues are the fourth highest in the history of PulteGroup and by far the highest in the past dozen years. So we appreciate the effort required to achieve these results. ","For PulteGroup it\u2019s not just about growth, but forecast \u2013 but focusing on profitable growth which is why it also highlight our industry-leading gross margins. While we do not run the business to achieve a specific gross margin, we understand its power in driving earnings. Having said that, we are continuing to run the business with a view towards generating high returns on invested capital by balancing price and pace on a community-by-community basis.","The 18% increase in homebuilding revenues also allowed us to realize meaningful overhead leverage which in combination with our more efficient homebuilding operations and lower share count drove the company\u2019s significant earnings gains in 2018.","PulteGroup\u2019s success this past year also reflects the tremendous time, effort and skill provided by all of our employees. Employees who, in addition to building great homes have built incredible culture that ranks among the top 5% of companies globally as measured by Gallop. I want to offer a sincere thank you to each of them for delivering the great experience to our home buyers and our shareholders.","In addition to a lot of hard work, our growth in 2018 also reflects ongoing investments we\u2019ve been making in the business. Over the past four years, we\u2019ve invested over $10 billion in land acquisition and development, but have done so with a clear focus on building a more efficient land pipeline. ","The result is that we\u2019ve successfully shortened the duration of our own lots which is now below four years, while simultaneously increasing option lots, which now represents 40% of our controlled lot position.","I would also point out that with roughly 54% of 2018\u2019s approved lots being controlled via option, we expect to make further progress going forward. To put our current land portfolio in perspective, at the end of 2014, we owned almost six years of land with only a quarter of the pipeline held via option. ","We firmly believe that our more efficient land pipeline and help support high returns while reducing the market risk associated with owning longer land positions. ","Another benefit of our disciplined land acquisition process is the capital efficiency it has helped us generate, which allows us to be balanced and more shareholder-friendly with our overall capital allocation. ","In 2018, we used excess capital to repurchase nearly $300 million of PulteGroup\u2019s common shares while also paying out over $100 million in dividends since re-establishing our dividend and share repurchase programs in 2013, we have returned nearly $3 million of capital to shareholders while retiring approximately 31% of our outstanding shares. ","As we have stated, we are managing our business against the defined objectives of growing pre-tax income while working to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. Our 2018 results demonstrate that we continue to successfully execute this disciplined and balanced approach to the business and that we and shareholders continue to reap the benefits.","As strong as our 2018 operating and financial performance was, the reality is that the numbers reflect an outstanding spring selling season followed by an industry-wide softening of demand beginning late in the second quarter. To widely varying degrees, this change has been felt across all buyer groups in most if not all markets across the country. ","This is setting up 2019 to be more of a challenging year. Many point to the rise in interest rates that accelerated in Q2 of 2018 is the trigger for the changing consumer behavior, I think the rise in interest rates maybe better viewed as the proverbial final straw rather than a trigger as it came on top of several years of home price appreciation and growing affordability challenges. ","The combination of these things, coupled with global trade and geopolitical unrest was enough to move potential buyers to the sidelines and create a general sense of uncertainty. Consistent with much of the commentary issued over the past several weeks, we too experienced a sequential improvement in qualified buyer traffic to our communities as interest rates moved lower.","On a per store basis, traffic was lower in October and November compared with last year but the trend turned positive in December. Given this is the seasonally slow part of the year however, I would encourage just all not too read much into the data.","Thinking about 2019, there is less certainty about demand heading into this spring selling season than the industry has experienced in a number of years. We have seen forecast for U.S. new home sales ranging from up 5% or more to down 5% or more. ","If demand conditions accelerate, and absorption rates improve, we have the communities, inventory and lots available to meet that demand, at the same time, we have the balance sheet to continue investing in the growth of the business. ","If however, demand in the upcoming spring selling season remains soft, we will work closely with our local operators in assessing each community\u2019s prospects with an eye toward delivering the best risk-adjusted returns. For some communities, this could mean working to drive greater absorption pace while others may look to maintain price and margins. ","There is no one size fits all answer for how each community will be run, but rather a thoughtful balanced approach to managing the company in its entirety. It is worth highlighting that we remain constructive on the market. ","As a result, we believe there is potential for improving or at least more stable demand due to the fact that broader \u2013 the broader operating environment remains strong in terms of a growing economy, great jobs numbers, rising wages and continued high levels of consumer confidence. ","Fortunately and finally, I feel confident about how our business is positioned to navigate the year however it plays out. We have a great team, great product, and great assets and the actions that we\u2019ve taken over the past few years to shorten the duration of our land pipeline to increase options, to drive our margin performance and to enhance our balance sheet puts us in a position to operate from a position of strength. ","Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup completed 2018 by posting another quarter of strong financial results. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, the company\u2019s reported fourth quarter numbers were impacted by several significant items. In my remarks, I will be addressing both our reported and our adjusted results.","As Jim mentioned, we\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of our reported to our adjusted results in the press release we issued this morning, as well as in the slides we posted in connection with this webcast. Consistent with recent commentary related to the housing market, we experienced softer demand during the fourth quarter relative to the same period last year and to our third quarter of this on a seasonally-adjusted basis. ","For the quarter, we reported net sign-ups of 4267 homes, which is down 11% from last year. As has been the case for much of 2018, our active adult business outperformed our more traditional communities with our active adult communities up 1% while first time and move up communities were both lower by 15%. ","While sign-ups were lower, same-store traffic trends improved in the quarter \u2013 improved as the quarter progressed and we sold more houses in December than in November.","These data points reinforce the view that buyer interest remains high and that we may be facing more of a temporary pause in demand as markets and buyers reset. However, as Ryan stated, the fourth quarter is our slowest quarter seasonally that we aren\u2019t reading too much into the recent results. ","As with net sign-ups our absorption pace has also slowed in the fourth quarter declining 14% compared with the prior year. Absorption paces were lower across each buyer groups decreasing 24% among first-time buyers, 13% among move-up buyers, and 9% among active adult buyers. ","While those buyers were slower to sign contracts in the fourth quarter, we entered the quarter with a large backlog of sold homes which allowed us to deliver excellent financial results in the period.","Homebuilding revenues in the quarter increased 6% over 2017 to $2.9 billion. The higher revenues for the quarter were the result of a 5% or $20,000 increase in the average sales price of homes closed of $430,000 along with the 1% increase in closings to 6709 homes. The 5% increase in our average sales price for the period reflects price increases realized across all buyer groups.","For the quarter, average sales prices among first-time buyers was up 15% over last year to $375,000, while our ASP for move-up buyers increased just under 1% to $477,000 and our active adult prices gained 4% to $405,000. ","The 15% increase in ASP among first-time buyers was driven by price increases realized across the number of markets, along with additional closings for certain communities in the Bay area of Northern California which sell at much higher prices.","In the quarter, closings by buyer group breakdown as follows; 27% were first-time, 46% move-up and 27% active adults which is comparable to last year\u2019s results. We ended the year with a total of 9491 homes under construction, of which 6245 or 66% were sold units and 3246 or 34% were specs.","I\u2019d like to point out that we elected to allow spec production to run higher than the recent quarters to ensure access to production trade and to position communities heading into 2019. This is a tactical decision as we expect spec production will come back in line as the year progresses. ","With 715 finished specs, still less than one per community, we remain comfortable with our production ahead of the spring selling season and like the opportunity these used to provide to meet any buyer demand for a quicker close. Our reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 21.5% includes $67 million of land impairment driven primarily by a project in our Mid-Atlantic market.","Excluding the impact of impairments, our adjusted fourth quarter gross margin was 23.8%, which is consistent with last year\u2019s adjusted gross margin. The Mid-Atlantic project we impaired related to an asset that we acquired in 2005 with the expectation it would ultimately be entitled for more than 1000 lots. ","Now, 14 years later, the project has still not received final approval and recent quarterly points we anticipated density being cut by almost two-thirds. It has been and remains our intention to build on this site, but the economics associated with the expected ultimate approval did not support the carrying value of our investments. This is yet another reminder of why we no longer buy un-entitled land. ","In addition to the land impairment charges related to this project, we also wrote-off approximately $5 million of deposits relating to a contagious parcel we controlled as part of that project as that element of the project was no longer deemed economical in today\u2019s market at the newly projected density. That charge has been reflected in other income expense on our income statement. ","During the quarter, we also recorded approximately $7 million of cost to reflect higher post-closing performance obligations relating to a previously sold asset which has been reflected in land sales cost of revenues on our income statement. While market conditions are more competitive, we continue to successfully execute key sales practices which has helped drive our revenue and margin performance over the years.","This includes our strategic pricing methodology, through which we seek to ensure that we are priced competitively in the market, while continuing to realize value from options and lot premiums. In the fourth quarter, our option revenues and lot premiums increased 8.3% or approximately $5400 over last year to more than $83,000 per home.","Sales discounts in the fourth quarter came in just under $15,000 per home or about $3.3% of average sales price. This is an increase of ten basis points over the fourth quarter of last year and is up 30 basis points for the third quarter of this year. ","Reported SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $292 million or 10.1% of home sale revenues. Our SG&A in the quarter reflects modest increases in incentive compensation and sales commissions. Fourth quarter 2017 SG&A expense of $202 million or7.4% of home sale revenues included a $66 million pre-tax benefit from insurance-related adjustments. ","Last year\u2019s adjusted SG&A expense was $268 million or 9.8% of home sale revenue. In the fourth quarter, our financial services business reported pre-tax income of $5 million, compared with $23 million in the fourth quarter of last year. In the current year quarter, we reported a $16 million adjustment to our mortgage origination reserves as we sell the claim tied to mortgages issued prior to the last housing collapse. ","Beyond this adjustment, our financial services business continued to operate in a competitive market environment, which impacted our capture rate and margin. In the fourth quarter, our capture rate declined to 77% from 81% last year. Our reported income tax expense for the fourth quarter was $92 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 27.9%. ","The higher rate relative to our guide reflects $14.1 million of expense relating to valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and a $6.9 million benefit relating to a tax method change. ","Looking ahead to 2019, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.3%. For the quarter, our reported net income was $238 million compared with $77 million last year. On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter 2018 net income increased 24% over last year to $314 million. ","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter totaled $1.11 which is an increase of 31% over the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was calculated using approximately 280 million shares, which is a decrease of 13 million shares or 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. ","The lower share count was driven primarily by the company\u2019s ongoing share repurchase program pursuant to which we bought back 10.9 million shares in 2018 at a cost of $295 million or $27 per share. ","These figures include 5.1 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter for $122 million or $24.13 per share. We ended 2018 with $1.1 billion of cash and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 39% which is down from 42% at the end of last year. On a net basis, our debt-to-capital ratio fell to 28%. ","Let me conclude my review of the fourth quarter by providing a couple of additional data points on our homebuilding operation. During the fourth quarter, we operated out of 815 communities, which is up 3% over last year and in line with our guidance. Based on anticipated community openings and closings, we expect community count in 2019 to be comparable with 2018. ","In the quarter, we invested $335 million in land acquisitions and approved 6400 lots for purchase. Of the lots approved in the fourth quarter, 55% were under some form of option. For the full year, we invested $1.2 billion in land acquisition, which is up 13% over last year and approved 28,000 lots. We continue to focus on smaller, faster turning transactions as the average project size is approximately 140 lots.","At present, we expect our land acquisition spend for 2019 to be approximately $1.2 billion which is comparable with last year. We will also work to use option transactions when they support our objectives of enhancing returns or lowering risk. ","We ended 2018 with approximately $150,000 lots under control, of which 40% were controlled via options with 90,000 lots owned, we continue to carry less than 40 years of owned land. With 54% of the lots we approved in 2018 being under option, we are successfully executing into our strategy of wanting to own three years of land or less. ","We continue to evolve a shorter, faster turning land bank which can help to improve asset turn and overall returns on invested capital while helping to lower market risk. We believe this approach grows increasingly valuable considering recent demand volatility and the dual threats of higher interest rates and\/or a slowing economy which could impact overall housing demand.","As noted, our traffic numbers picked up over the past several weeks, and our December sign-ups increased on a sequential basis from November, which are positive. However, given the uncertainties in the market and the broader economy, we will only be providing guidance with respect to PulteGroup\u2019s expected first quarter results at this time. ","Based on our production pipeline of 9500 homes under construction, we expect Q1 2019 deliveries to be in the range of 4300 to 4600 homes with an average sales price of approximately $420,000. We continue to execute against our return-focused business model, which means that we must remain price competitive in the markets we serve. ","As such, we took actions to adjust our selling efforts as market conditions improved increasingly competitive in the latter half of 2018. Given these adjustments and the lingering impact of higher lumber cost, we currently expect first quarter gross margins to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. ","As a result of our lower volumes and pricing, we expect to realize less overhead leverage with SG&A as a percent of homebuilding revenues likely approaching 13.5% in the first quarter.","And finally, as I noted earlier, we expect our effective tax rate in 2019 to be approximately 25.3%. In conclusion, the company\u2019s strong operating and financial performance in the past year has us well positioned heading into 2019. ","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for a few final comments. Ryan? "," Ryan Marshall","Thanks, Bob. As I discussed, the softer demand conditions evident the late Q2 and Q3 continued into Q4 and while we have seen better traffic over the past several weeks, it is still too early to get an accurate read on what this means for the spring selling season. ","In terms of regional commentary about the quarter, like the weather, demand in the fourth quarter gotten warmer as you move from north from south both along the eastern and middle thirds of the country. ","Demand in our northeast and mid-west markets was challenged, but showed some improvement in December. We saw the same pattern across our Texas markets, while Florida was arguably the country\u2019s best area of demand. ","And finally, out west, conditions are generally unchanged with higher price point communities in Washington and Northern California sings to our absorption paces, while demand in Phoenix is holding up reasonably well. ","So as we head into 2019, and what will likely be a more challenging year, let me just quickly check off a few reasons why I am confident in PulteGroup\u2019s competitive position. We have a broad operating footprint, but with sufficient scale in the markets in which we operate, we have a diversified customer base although we are biased toward the more financially capable buyer groups. ","We have built a supportive and efficient land pipeline, but without having gotten overly aggressive with recent land spend. We have a strong balance sheet with tremendous financial flexibility. And maybe our biggest strengths, we have an experienced leadership team including our area and division presidents who know how to operate in changing market conditions.","Let me conclude on that comment and turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Ryan. We will open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and follow-up. Operator, if you would explain the process, we\u2019ll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Dahl, RBC Capital Markets. ","Michael Dahl ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Ryan Marshall","Hi, Mike. ","Michael Dahl ","I want to just start \u2013 hi, just the discussion around the current sales environment. It sounds like you made the decision and understanding it\u2019s community-by-community, but given the competitive pressures to incentivize a bit more. ","Curious to get your thoughts on a couple things. First, to the extent that you are incentivizing what types of incentives are you finding to be most effective at this point? And tied into that, to what extent is, I think, Bob, you mentioned the commissions in SG&A, to what extent are Hire Co brokers influencing your SG&A? ","Ryan Marshall","Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question and I think you hit the nail right on head. It\u2019s really on a \u2013 it\u2019s a community-by-community basis where we are making those decisions and our operators are quite skilled at evaluating the competitive set that we operate in within that specific zip code if you will or within that specific municipality. ","And so we are evaluating that. In terms of what\u2019s most effective, I think we\u2019ve been quite clear to say that affordability is the challenge. And so, the incentives that we can provide that help to alleviate pressure around affordability or the things that are being most effective. ","We talked about \u2013 I talked about it extensively on our last call where our general view is base price is the last thing that we like to adjust. So, we try to do it through other forms of incentives to hopefully create urgency and alleviate some of the pressure that the buyers have felt around affordability. ","You saw our total discounts tick up a little teeny bit, but for the most part I think we\u2019ve been able to do it in a variety of other ways to create little bit of pressure relief on the affordability side. I\u2019ll let Bob talk about what we saw in the SG&A from added commissions.","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Mike, we obviously, we are working with the broker community. We saw probably ten basis points of incremental SG&A cost around co-brokers.","Michael Dahl ","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. As far as my second question and just a follow-up on the gross margins, just given your build cycle, given while you have increased your specs a bit, it\u2019s still relatively low. I understand that you are only giving the first quarter guidance. But if we think about what the actions are that you\u2019ve taken over the past several months to alleviate the affordability to increase incentives a bit? ","Is this one quarter, 1Q gross margin fully reflective of the steps you\u2019ve taken or if current market conditions persist, would you expect that it might take another quarter or so to see that impact fully flow through, so that 22 to 22.5 gross margin could step a bit lower? ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Mike, fair question. We are not giving guidance beyond the first quarter. So with that having been said, certainly the sales environment over the next, call it two to three months will matter. To that, impacting our margins obviously will be lumber cost. We are still feeling the spike in pricing through the middle of the year. ","So that\u2019s impacting our first and to a degree the second quarter. That will be a relative tailwind as we get to the back half of the year. And the other thing that\u2019s impacting our margins in this quarter, in the first quarter is interest expense. ","So, if you think about our interest expense, we did some fairly significant financing activity back in 2016. 2018 is really the first year where our total capitalized interest is equal to our expense. So we are feeling a little bit relative drag on margins. ","You could see it for instance in this most recent quarter, it was probably 50 or 60 basis points, it will be less next year, it\u2019s probably 20 or 30 basis points of the margin decline that you see in the first quarter relative to the prior year. We had a couple of things moving around of it. ","Operator","We will take our first question from John Lovallo from Bank of America. ","John Lovallo ","Hey guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one, you guys have announced recently the expansion of Centex into a few new markets. I guess the question is, how quickly can this effort be accelerated given your current land position? And I mean, do you see this as the appropriate strategy of pushing more into Centex here? ","Ryan Marshall","Yes, John, it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question and if I take you back to 2016, fall of 2016, one of the first earnings calls that I was on we talked about some of the shifts that we were making inside of the company to rebalance our portfolio and serve all consumer groups. ","We indicated that it would be a subtle shift where we wanted to move about five points of market share from our move-up buyer into the more affordable price points. We wanted to do it the right way though, John. And so, we\u2019ve intentionally gone out and targeted land parcels that will efficiently and effectively allow us to put a more affordable product on the ground. ","Certainly, we could have taken existing parcels and put more affordable product there to kind of satisfy the metric, but it\u2019s just not the way that we think about running the business. We are in this for the long-term. We have stated over and over again we are looking to drive the best possible economic outcome for our shareholders and specific to your question about being more affordable, I think that means, you go out and you target the right pieces of land to do at the right way. ","What I\u2019d highlight for you, John, is that about 33%, 34% of the land that we have under control is specifically targeted to our first-time buyer group. So, while the closings today only represent about 27% of our closing volume, we see that on a go-forward inching closer and closer to what we actually have controlled as a total percentage of our overall land portfolio.","John Lovallo ","Okay, that\u2019s encouraging. Maybe along the same lines, do you guys have any ability to reduce square footage within your existing communities to kind of help meet this affordability challenges?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, we think we are already there today, John. We offer really good flexibility within our existing product line-up that allows customers to kind of go up and down based on needs. We\u2019ve got a number of structural options that allow you to take an 1800 square foot floor plan as an example and you can add on a loft or you can stick right what the 1800 floor plan as an example. ","So, I think what we are seeing from buyers, the way that they are currently buying is, they are still buying the square footage that they need to satisfy their family dynamic. They may be taking less options and cabinets or countertops or flooring upgrades to help manage the affordability pinch. But we have not seen buyers go all the way to the bottom-end of our product line-up which I think would tell you that the way we are covering the range of square footage is appropriate. ","So, if we were to go there and we have in prior cycles, it takes some time. It\u2019s not just a, call the ball and you moved your lower square footage. There is obviously entitlement and permitting things that have got to be done with cities. So, something that we are capable of doing if we felt like the market was going there, we\u2019d certainly undertake the efforts to do that. ","But our view and you heard me say kind of in my prepared remarks, we remain constructive on the market and we think the way we are positioned today for the most part is correct.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. ","Alan Ratner ","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first question, on the traffic commentary as far as that\u2019s seeing some improvement there in December, were they any particular price points or markets where that was most evident and has that trend continued on a year-over-year basis thus far into January?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Alan, we saw it really across all the markets that we operate in. So I wouldn\u2019t highlight one that\u2019s been an outlier. It was a general improvement which we take a sign and it\u2019s part of the reason that we tried to be a tad optimistic about what we\u2019ve seen in terms of traffic patterns, because it is a pretty widespread improvement and the trends have continued into January similar to what we said in December, the first two or three weeks of January are typically the very early stages of the spring selling season and we don\u2019t see that typical spring selling pick up until after really the Super Bowl first part of February is when we see things officially kick in with spring selling season. ","Alan Ratner ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. The second question, I think the discounting disclosures you gave, I believe is on closings. I was curious if you have that trend what it looks like on the orders that were placed in the quarter and I guess, just thinking about the spring, I fully appreciate the community-by-community discussion, but how would you articulate the strategy? ","I mean, we\u2019ve heard from a few other builders effectively say definitively that that gross margin is going to be the plug and it\u2019s important to keep the volume machine running. So, how would you characterize your overarching strategy heading into the spring when you think about what you are going to prioritize that takes over price? ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Alan, it\u2019s Bob. We historically haven\u2019t given color on the actual sales that we recorded, we will give ASPs. But I think what you should think about is in terms of the guide we gave for the first quarter margin, certainly we are seeing some margin erosion as a result of the sales environment that we saw in the \u2013 what we highlighted in the prepared remarks was, the back half of the year that\u2019s \u2013 if we\u2019ve got whole in a five months build cycle, you\u2019ve got most of the third quarter embodied, sorry, third and fourth quarter embodied in that guide that we\u2019ve given. So that should give you some insight as to the discounting we got to do.","Ryan Marshall","And then Alan, just in terms of your question about what will we prioritize, I would probably going to sound a little bit like a broken record, but we will continue to make pace and price decisions on a community-by-community basis and do it with an eye toward what we believe gives us the most favorable economic outcome. ","Certainly, your comment about keeping the production machine going factors into that overall equation, we are a production builder. You\u2019ve heard me say in the last couple of conference calls that volume matters and it does to us and it certainly does to our competitors\u2019 tray. We are all competing for a limited number of trades and the ability to keep a consistent production volume going in our communities is a big deal. ","It was part of the reason that we \u2013 it\u2019s part of the reason that you saw us make the tactical decision to increase our spec production just a little teeny bit. The other thing that we think about too just from an overhead efficiency standpoint is making sure that if we accelerate pace, that we actually have a new community to move into, so, is the land pipeline positioned such that if we close out earlier, you can move the team to the next location. ","So, those are all things that we take into consideration as we go through that community-by-community analysis. I think what you\u2019ve seen from us is, consistent and balanced view where we have continued to worked to drive the volume in the right spots. But we have maintained some level of the superior gross margin profile that we\u2019ve worked to build over time. ","But we haven\u2019t \u2013 with a single eye or single vision held on to it, you\u2019ve seen some of that erode, as we work to be competitive. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. ","Stephen Kim ","Thanks very much guys. Thanks for all the color. I guess, my first question relates to the quick move in home commentary. I think, Ryan, you just mentioned you increased your specs just a teeny little bit. When we\u2019ve been out in the field, we\u2019ve noticed that folks \u2013 customers have been a little reluctant to pay up for rate locks going out much more than a few months and so, the biggest amount of activity or demand has been on homes that they can move into relatively quickly without having to pay for such a long way block. I was curious therefore, to what degree doing more specs to maybe take advantage of buyer demand and also you mentioned some labor efficiencies. Whether you thought that there may be some opportunity to make this a little bit more of a lasting change and just to get a sense for how you are thinking about this spec activity? Is it purely temporary or perhaps maybe something that might be more lasting? ","Ryan Marshall","Stephen, I would expect this to be temporary from us. We\u2019ve done extensive work and feel that we end up with a better long-term outcome by running more of a built-to-order model and I think that\u2019s what you should continue to expect to see from us. ","I think we\u2019ve got other tools that we have effectively used with rate buy-downs and longer term rate locks that allow us to give the customers that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations enough protection to give them confidence to buy. So, I think you will see us over the quarters over the next several months and few quarters revert back to our typical spec cadence. ","Stephen Kim ","Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then, regarding the \u2013 the comments you\u2019ve made regarding the spring selling season or the pre-season here thus far, I think you mentioned that traffic improvement in the last several weeks, well, but too early to make a call on all that, I was curious if \u2013 and you also mentioned you are still constructive on the market. ","So, two-part question here, regarding your comments about the tone of business and on the traffic side, is it your view that the data you\u2019ve seen on traffic has been a little too choppy to have conviction around the direction things are going? ","And has maybe there been less interest reflected in deposits than there has been in traffic? Is that a part of your view that maybe it\u2019s little too early to make a call? And secondly, regarding your comments about being still constructive on the market, I am wondering how much this constructiveness is a reflection of maybe seeing some strength in December and January and if there is anything that you might see in the next month or two, that would make you go less constructive. So that when we speak to you next time, you would be less constructive than you are today. ","Ryan Marshall","Well, I am going to politely probably take a pass on the last part of that question, because, I think it would be asking me to peer into a crystal ball. So, we\u2019ve obviously got a number of scenarios that we look at here, Stephen. ","But I will probably avoid rolling many of those out on this call. In terms of kind of traffic and what\u2019s happened and the reasons why we are constructive, I think that\u2019s very relevant conversation question. What I\u2019d highlight is on a same-store basis, adjusting for community count in the fourth quarter in total was down year-over-year. ","So that\u2019s the negative. Now the positive is that, the November and December got sequentially better and by the time we got to December, we were on a community count adjusted basis, we were showing positive comps year-over-year and that has continued into January. So, that\u2019s part of the reason that I think we are slightly optimistic about what the spring selling season will hold. ","I think in terms of kind of the affordability pinch that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, and I would highlight it again here, I think that\u2019s been the challenge with buyers is there has been an affordability pinch and then there has been a steady stream of kind of negative news if you will that plays out in the media and the newspapers almost every single day about the real estate market and that ultimately I think factors into the psyche of a buyer when they are getting ready to make a major life purchase like buying a home, some north of $400,000. ","So, if interest rates can maintain some stability, I think that\u2019s certainly a factor. We need to continue to see some wage growth and I think the rate of price appreciation is to moderate just a tad and not further exacerbate the affordability crisis. So, some things, as far as big picture and I was kidding a little bit with my initial commentary about things that we are looking at into the future and that could change it for the positive or the negative. ","But to big picture, we are always looking at consumer confidence. That\u2019s something that I think is a big deal and I highlighted that just a second ago with the buyer psyche. So, what\u2019s going on with the job picture, job adds, et cetera on a market-by-market basis. ","Certainly, we would pay attention to traffic trends and then deterioration or improvement in overall sales volume and then any kind of quick or unexpected rate hikes would certainly also be the other kind of big picture factor that we would look to over the coming months that could significantly improve or erode how we feel about the spring selling season.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Ken Zener ","Good morning gentlemen. ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hi, Ken.","Ryan Marshall","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zener ","Ryan, last quarter I asked you about kind of your view about existing inventory. I know we\u2019re talking about price and affordability and interest rates, but just want to ask again, I mean, do you think the existing inventory is tight and I ask because it would seem to potentially impact your traded buyers which are \u2013 obviously, a lot of your buyers, could you talk about how or what you are seeing out there? ","Ryan Marshall","Yes, broadly, I would tell you that inventory levels are in the \u2013 what I\u2019d consider the healthy zone. We have always pegged it at six months of supply and most markets are still running well below that. There are still a few markets that are less than three months of supply. So, I would tell you, Ken, there is not a lot that\u2019s changed in the last quarter with the existing inventory supply. ","Ken Zener ","Okay. And then, getting your comments around, asking A, in 1Q, I know you gave us a percent of just looking back on 2018, is there a fixed dollar value that we should think about for SG&A? I apologize if I haven\u2019t \u2013 lot of your commissions here are variable cost, right. I am just trying to see how much that\u2019s going to swing around five quarter based on volumes, so\u2026 ","Ryan Marshall","Ken, I don\u2019t know that there is a \u2013 sort of a fixed dollar level. You should think about our commissions generally run around 3.5% and I think everything else is variable in the medium-term. So, we feel pretty good about the SG&A that we delivered this year. We highlighted that we were little bit outside of our guide for the fourth quarter, but certainly well within or actually better than our guide for the full year. We had a good year. ","So there was some compensation in the fourth quarter. We highlighted the commission. So, I think, it will be determined candidly by volume, right. And so, where the volume wins look, what has it, we think we\u2019ve got pretty good controls over our expenses right now. And certainly, if there are places where we see the business not materializing to the level that we think it should be, we would look at costs there. ","So, again, it\u2019s not fixed versus variable, because candidly, everything is variable in the medium-term for us and we feel pretty good about what we delivered in 2018 and we would expect to maintain that same level of discipline in 2019. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. ","Nishu Sood ","Thank you. So, appreciate all the commentary about traffic. Wanting to ask about orders. Bob, I think you mentioned December orders were higher than they were in November which I think seasonally is a typical. If I looked at it on a year-over-year basis, did that also register an improvement in the year-over-year order pace? And then, how have orders looked? Are they better or worse in January?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Well, we haven\u2019t provided any commentary on January. I don\u2019t have it in front of me the December versus December and we have to look at communities, Nishu, but we can get that for you.","Nishu Sood ","Okay, thanks. And second question, the demand weakness that you mentioned across all buyer groups, I think is how you characterize it. That \u2013 the kind of prevailing view out there is that the weakness has been mainly to the move-up and much less so at the first-time buyer. Just wanted to understand your different take on the market if we can look at it that way, perhaps one thought that occurs to me is that, your first-time buyer category is at a price point of 375, which would be move-up for a lot of buyers. Is that the difference? Can you just help us understand your perspective about the demand trends across the buyer groups please?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Nishu, our first-time to your point does include some higher price point communities and it\u2019s mostly being driven by Northern California and Seattle. We\u2019ve got some truly first-time communities there that are at price points that are north of $700,000. ","So, that somewhat influences that. If you\u2019re to carve that out, we do still tend to run at the higher end of the first-time price point spectrum and we\u2019ve seen a softening if you will, with those buyers just likely had with the move up. We have seen nice strength in the active adult side. ","This particular quarter we are basically flat on an absorption level. But it is one buyer group that has held up quite nicely for us. ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","And Nishu, just to follow-up, December 2018 versus December 2017 was actually a little bit weaker. It was actually up about 4%, but that was an improvement compared to October versus October and November versus November. So we\u2019ve got relative performance and I\u2019d highlight for you that the fourth quarter of last year was pretty strong. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. ","Michael Rehaut ","Thanks. Good morning everyone. First question. I was just a little confused by comment earlier around sales on a same community basis which sounds like sales pace or sales per community. Did I hear right that December was up year-over-year in sales pace? ","It doesn\u2019t seem that way particularly if orders are down \u2013 were down in the quarter. I just wanted to kind of understand how sales pace progressed throughout the quarter on a year-over-year basis, months-to-month and if I did hear right or you did mean to say that sales pace was up year-over-year in December. ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Mike, I think it\u2019s the same question that we just answered for Nishu. We actually saw absorptions down year-over-year, but improving through the quarter. ","Michael Rehaut ","Okay, so was it down 4% - was that, I thought that was just orders not sales per community?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","That is correct. Sales per community would be down also, because community count was up.","Ryan Marshall","And Mike, I think the comment that you are referring to that Bob made in his prepared remarks on an absolute basis, we sold more homes in December in 2018 than we did in November of 2018. We are simply trying to make the point that the market improved for us based on our current book as we moved into the back half of the year or the back-end of the year \u2013 back-end of the fourth quarter. ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Sequentially through the quarter.","Michael Rehaut ","Okay. Now that\u2019s helpful. I guess, just secondly, when you kind of think more broadly in terms of where we are right now, I mean, obviously a lot of builders expressing kind of a holding off of guidance and the spring selling season as you\u2019ve mentioned before Ryan, kind of a bigger variable or question mark this year going in than several previous years. How are you seeing it from the incentive side on a broader market basis? ","We heard from Hordon late last week that there was a big move in incentives that they put into the market in November and perhaps that help them re-establish pace, but obviously at significantly lower margins. I was curious about when you kind of did the step-up in incentives during your 4Q, if that helped perhaps stabilize pace, I guess, it\u2019s still down year-over-year for you guys in December. ","But, I guess, it\u2019s really a two-parter. Number one, when did you step up in incentives during 4Q? And at this point if sales pace continues where it is, do you need a further step up to at least get that sales pace to be on the positive side?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Mike, there is a lot in there. I\u2019ll do my best, I think at least in spirit I talk to some of the things that I think you are asking and I\u2019d summarize it by \u2013 what I am hearing you ask is our incentive is effective at increasing sales pace and I would tell you it has been or we wouldn\u2019t do it. ","And our pricing model is such that, on a real-time basis, we are evaluating every single community on a community-by-community basis as we talked about and we are putting the incentives where we think they need to be. We have made the decision not to do more than what we are currently doing because we run the kind of trade-off between how much incremental volume could we do relative to the increase in incentives and the math frankly just doesn\u2019t work. ","So, we like the way we are running the business. We are running enough production through the machine for us to keep our trades and are pricing where it is and we will continue to look at the business the way that I think we always have and if things change we will react to that both to the positive and to the negative. ","So, that\u2019s probably the best thing to do in terms of summing it up for you in terms of incentives and how we look at it. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Jack Micenko with SIG. ","Jack Micenko ","Good morning. First question for Bob, help us understand where some of the financing incentives, buy downs and rate locks, where does that look in the income statement? Is that going be seen in margin, G&A or in the financial service line item?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","In gross margin, Jack","Jack Micenko ","Okay, okay, great. And then, 77% capture rate you got a good insight into most of your customers. When you look at the mortgage data in the last quarter or two, is it a DTI issue or is a sediment issue, what I mean by that is, are we bumping against DTI caps? Is there room to afford more and we just are uncomfortable or we are reading the news or whatever it is, or is the math just getting harder to work? ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Are you looking at that from our perspective or the consumer, Jack?","Jack Micenko ","In entry-level, can you hear me?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, sorry. I think from the consumer standpoint, certainly affordability has gotten challenged the QM rules and the DTI limitations really do apply and so especially if you are at the lower price points, I think that\u2019s where you are going. It\u2019s getting more challenging for them. It\u2019s interesting though, I mean, if you look at our data and our average FICO this quarter was 752 again. So there is qualified buyers out there. ","And I think everybody is now lending against the edges of the qualified mortgage rules. And so, what we are seeing is actually a very, very competitive market. And so, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s certainly not credit availability, but it\u2019s an issue and so for the consumer it\u2019s just looking for ways to pay. ","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Jack, the one thing that I would tell you is, we saw a little bit of a tick up in the use of arms in the quarter which I think would speak to the overall affordability pinch that we\u2019ve been talking about as consumers are looking for ways to make the available dollars stretch a little bit further to cover the payment. ","But, I agree with Bob that the LTVs that we see out of the mortgage company that\u2019s been stable and really hasn\u2019t changed at all the FICO scores have been over 750 for ever. So, it\u2019s a qualified group and I generally agree that we are probably getting closer to the edges on what consumers can actually afford within the credit box or underwriting. ","I think it\u2019s as much as anything mentally buyers have decided, they don\u2019t want to afford based on the negative headlines and some of the other things that we are seeing play out on the overall economy. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","Thank you, and good morning guys. If we \u2013 if you look at your cash, $1.1 billion, a big number, a couple of things there, one, what level are you all comfortable running at? I assume it\u2019s significantly lower than that and if you look at your excess cash after investing in your business, what would be as you look through 2019, your first priority, second priority thinking about buybacks, I mean, you can buyback a very large percentage of your shares outstanding if you decide to do that. But I don\u2019t know how M&A works into that, any debt repurchase et cetera?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Stephen, maybe I\u2019ll just \u2013 at a high level and then Bob maybe just chime in on the back-end. We are \u2013 in terms of capital allocation and where we are going, we are not changing on that all. Number one priority is to invest into the business and I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about that over time. M&A is including for us anyway as an investment into our business. ","We see that the same as organic investment into a land pipeline. We are paying our dividend. You saw at the end of \u2013 at the end of the year we increased our dividend for 2019. We announced that middle of December last year and then third priority is that we will take excess capital that we don\u2019t invest in the business and we\u2019ll use that to buy shares. ","So, the overall focus of how we are using cash and allocating capital, no changes there. And then, I\u2019ll let Bob speak to some of the cash questions that you have. ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, well, certainly, Stephen, we are pleased with the cash generation. We actually exceeded our expectations this year with $1.4 billion of cash flow. It has put us in a position having a pretty significant cash position and we are comfortable with that to be perfectly honest with you. Certainly, as Ryan laid out, our capital approach hasn\u2019t changed. ","I think the only thing I would to what Ryan talked about is, we would think about leverage as part of that. We\u2019ve talked about that before in terms of the near-term maturities. We don\u2019t have any maturity stack until 2021. So I would tell you that we also think that given the volatility of the existing market that having some cash on the balance sheet to be opportunistic wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. ","And so, as we sit here today, we will do exactly as Ryan laid out. We will think about leverage. But if there is some dislocation in the market, we think we can be opportunistic. We haven\u2019t seen the land values change much, but if they did, we want to be thinking about that as what we are going to do investing in the business as Ryan said, that\u2019s our first priority.","Operator","We'll take a question from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari ","Thank you. My first question is just around some of the costs that you are seeing some of the pressures there. I know that, lumber should be sort of a tailwind as we get to the second half of the year. But can you talk to maybe what you are seeing in terms of the labor side? Did that improve any? Or have you seen any changes, especially maybe with some of the uncertainty in the market? ","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Susan, I think, we didn\u2019t highlight it, but we see a relatively benign on a relative basis the prior year cost environment. Certainly, lumber what we\u2019re flowing through the income statement is a little bit high. We have to reflect the spike in pricing last year, but to your point, we think that will be a benefit. ","Outside of that or I guess, even including that, our expectation is probably for input cost, labor materials, probably about a 2% increase in 2019 versus 2018. And labor, I think the way we would characterize it as, it\u2019s not getting worse. We\u2019ve certainly \u2013 as the market has gotten a little bit choppier, we\u2019ve been out talking to our trade with that opportunities for us to be more efficient to help them to be more cost-effective for us. ","That\u2019s going to be market-by-market depending on how much activity is going on, what the trade capacity is. But I would tell you, we see that as being less impactful in terms of an increase in 2019 than we have for the last couple of years. ","Susan Maklari ","Okay. And then, my next question is just as we think about some of the regional trends that you talk to not just for the fourth quarter, but even sort of for more broadly 2018, they are somewhat reflective of sort of these broader kind of population shifts and some of the bigger sort of trends that we\u2019ve been seeing. ","How do you think about your geographic footprint over the long-term? Is there anything that we should expect might change just over the course of time?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Susan, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that there is anything major coming in terms of our geographic focus. We\u2019ve long been the most geographically diverse builder and I\u2019d think that you will continue to see us play in most major markets. ","Certainly, the southern states, southwest and southeast and Texas or places where migratory patterns would suggest that there is a higher propensity of new jobs being created there as well as consumers and buyers relocating there whether it\u2019s for jobs or quality of life or both. I think you will continue to see us make investments in those places. ","That being said, we still have a business in the northeast that we like. This last quarter was a bit tougher, similar commentary around the Midwest. So, we\u2019ll continue to look to see where population growth is occurring and where jobs are being created. Those are certainly two of the big drivers of housing demand and we\u2019d want to be positioned in such way that we take advantage of it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take a follow-up question from Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","Thank you. I appreciate the quick follow-up. If we look at our land \u2013 no problem, if we look at the vintage of land, your Del Webb or big communities fairly old, I am trying to understand your business mix. What type of vintage are you running through Del Webb right now? And then, as you reactivate the Centex brand are you also \u2013 is that primarily new land purchases or are those more legacy purchases from years ago?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Stephen, I'll answer the second question first, which is these are new land purchases. We do not have any significant dated assets that we are re-energizing or opening today. And then, with respect to Del Webb, we have five or six of the big communities as the same ones we\u2019ve had for years and we\u2019ll have for years coming. Other than that, that book is turning over on average I\u2019ll reported five years. ","The underwriting for most of the deals we are doing now is somewhere in that four to five year range. So we are cycling through those communities that are little bit longer that are non-age restricted, but not much. ","Operator","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer for any additional or closing remarks.","James Zeumer","Great. Sorry that we\u2019ve run out of time. But we will certainly be available if you've got any questions over the course of the day. We look forward to speaking with you later on and otherwise, we will talk to you on our next earnings call.

My name is Carol, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2016 PulteGroup Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn today's call over to Mr. Jim Zeumer.","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Okay. Thank you, Carol. And let me welcome everyone to today's conference call discussing PulteGroup's first quarter financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman and CEO; Ryan Marshall, President; Rob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call later this afternoon.","Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert everyone, all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Some of you may have seen the letter issued yesterday by Bill Pulte over his grandson's performance on CNBC yesterday. As there is nothing new in Bill's letter, we will not be responding to these attacks or otherwise be discussing the Pulte's on this call other than to say that we stand by the completeness and accuracy of our previous disclosures.","We run this company for the benefit of all shareholders and we'll continue to do so. I've had the opportunity these past few weeks to speak with many of our largest holders; and it's encouraging to hear your support for our entire leadership team, our board of directors and our value creation strategy. I want to take this opportunity to assure all investors that we are busy running this company and remain squarely focused on continuing to deliver value for you.","To that point, we're extremely pleased with the strength of our first quarter results. Consistent with our strategy and our efforts to enhance returns on invested capital, for the past few years we've highlighted strategic pricing, construction productivity and balance sheet efficiency as drivers of our performance.","Our financial results over the past few years reflect these drivers, as we realize significant gains in pre-tax profitability despite only modest gains in production volumes. Many of you have seen the graph in our investor presentation, which we've included in today's conference call slides, which was our pre-tax income improving by $1.1 billion over the past five years on just a 12% increase in closings.","We have communicated that 2016 would be an inflection year, with increasing volume being delivered through a much more efficient homebuilding operation. The combination of rising unit volumes, increasing average sales prices and the more efficient homebuilding machine can translate into significant earnings growth. Add in the benefit of consistently returning funds to shareholders, and you have a business that can produce high returns for its investors over time.","As Bob will detail in a moment, the business is beginning to turn in that direction with sign-ups increasing by 10% to almost 5,700 homes; closing volumes gaining 17% to almost 4,000 closings; average selling prices expanding by 9% to $353,000; and our backlog value climbing 31% to $3.4 billion. These metrics obviously resulted in the strong quarterly performance in the first quarter; but equally important, they position the company to deliver continued growth over the balance of 2016.","While our Q1 numbers and our expectations for 2016 point to increasing scale, we have not and will not lose our focus on our primary objective: to run a business that can deliver better returns over the housing cycle and do so with less risk.","We have believed since the outset of this housing recovery that it would be more gradual than the V-shaped rebound, typical of most housing cycles. Our thesis is unchanged as we expect an extended recovery will continue to unfold for the next several years supported by improving economy, favorable demographics, years of relative under-building and a supportive mortgage rate environment.","Given these dynamics, we've been increasing our investment in the business, but have done so in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects while expanding our use of options when possible. This has served to shorten our years of land supply helping to mitigate market risk.","We've also focused our land investments on closer-in locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately takes a breather. We have accepted the trade-off of having to pay a little more for certain positions, but where we can be more confident in their future performance.","As evidence of our focus on driving returns and reducing risk relative to prior business practices, consider that our supply of owned lots has fallen from approximately 8.5 years in 2010 to roughly 5.5 years in 2015.","Based on our land acquisition discipline, expected sales paces, as we work through some of our longer and older communities, we look for our own supply to continue trending lower in the future. Among the reasons for the decline is that approved land deals over the past five years have averaged roughly 125 controlled lots per community; and this includes 31 new Del Webb projects over that timeframe that have averaged just over 500 controlled lots each.","Along with how we manage land, our more disciplined approach to the business extends to the management of the company's entire balance sheet. Bob and his team have done an outstanding job reshaping our balance sheet and giving us the financial strength to run our day-to-day operations and the flexibility to seize on opportunities that develop in the market.","As I mentioned earlier, we remain in the camp that this housing recovery has several more years of growth in front of it. At just north of 500,000 new home sales, unit volumes remain 30% below the historic average; and with millennials beginning to buy homes, the leading edge of that demographic is now impacting the market.","These factors, along with a growing economy, modest wage inflation and a favorable outlook for jobs, keeps us optimistic about the near and long-term opportunities for PulteGroup.","Let me turn over the call to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Richard, and good morning everyone. Consistent with Richard's comments regarding the positive market environment, our first quarter financial results show significant gains in key operating metrics. In addition to delivering strong results in the quarter, our Q1 numbers have the company well-positioned to deliver outstanding full year results as well.","Looking at the business, we experienced excellent demand in the first quarter with sign-ups increasing 10% to 5,652 homes. The year-over-year increase in the dollar value of sign-ups is even greater, climbing 24% to $2.1 billion.","Breaking down sales by buyer group, unit sign-ups increased 2% among first-time buyers and 37% among move-up buyers, while sales decreased 12% within our active adult communities. The decrease among active adult buyers was due in part to the closeout of several selling efforts.","Looking at buyer groups, our absorption pace has increased 8% among first-time buyers and declined 4% and 5% respectively among move-up and active adult buyers. Excluding the impact of the Wieland assets, which typically have slower absorption paces and largely influenced our move-up buyer group, our overall absorption paces were flat.","During the quarter, home sale revenues totaled $1.4 billion, which is up 28% over last year. The significant increase in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 17% increase in closings to 3,945 homes, combined with a 9% increase in average sales price to $353,000. The 17% increase in closings resulted from the increased sales activity we've experienced over the last few quarters, coupled with a slight increase in our conversion rate.","Our Q1 conversion rate improved over last year, but it is still running below recent multi-year averages. We expect this pattern to continue in Q2 and throughout 2016 as we make gradual progress on conversion rates versus last year. However, elongated construction cycle times will prevent us in the near-term from reaching the levels we realized a few years ago.","Looking at the mix of our closings in the first quarter, 29% were first-time buyers, 41% were move-up buyers and 30% were active adult buyers. In Q1 of last year, closings by buyer group were 33% first-time, 34% move-up and 33% active adult.","As I noted, our ASP increased 9% in the first quarter reflecting our continuing mix shift towards the move-up business, coupled with increases from all consumer groups, including: an 8% increase to $252,000 for first-time buyers; a 7% increase to $425,000 for move-up buyers; and a 5% increase to $353,000 for active adult buyers.","I would like to point out that in addition to the increased selling prices we realized from our Q1 closings, we also realized notably higher sales prices from current sales that resulted in the ASP in our backlog being up 14% over the prior year. These pricing gains are primarily driven by the mix shift to move-up that I mentioned a moment ago, coupled with higher sales prices at Wieland communities.","Given our expectations for backlog conversion rates and the longer build times associated with the large Wieland products, the higher backlog ASPs will translate it to higher closing prices on a gradual, but sustained basis over the remaining quarters of 2016 and into 2017.","In the first quarter, we reported gross margin of 21.9%, which includes approximately 80 basis points of decrease associated with our acquisition of the Wieland assets. Excluding the impact of the Wieland transaction, margins were consistent with last year.","It's worth noting that in addition to the impact of the Wieland purchase, our Q1 margins reflected anticipated higher land, labor and material costs, offset by lower interest charges.","Offsetting some of the cost pressure has been our continued success in systematically increasing the amount of option dollars and lot premiums which provide richer margins we realized on each home. In the first quarter, option revenues per closing increased 6% or slightly more than $3,000 over the prior year, while lot premiums increased by 4% or just under $600 per home.","Sales discounts in the quarter increased 40 basis points over last year to 2.6% per home, which is consistent with results we've seen over the past several quarters. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to address some questions we've gotten over the past few quarters related to our gross margin.","Specifically, over time we've been asked about the influence on our gross margin of longer dated assets that had basis adjustments during the downturn in the market. In response to this, you may recall that we provided an analysis of our Del Webb assets and related margins which we've included in slide 11 in our webcast deck that provided comparisons future of our older, much larger legacy Del Webb communities who are our small newer positions.","As you can see on that slide, we enjoy strong margins on that entire book of business with the more recent investments also enjoying strong return. Based on continuing questions from investors around our entire land position, we've prepared some additional analysis which is included in slide 12 of the deck. That slide provides details comparing the margins and income statement impact of our newer and never impaired land with that of our land that was either impaired by us or adjusted through the fair value process as part of the Centex acquisition.","Looking at the slide, there are a few things I would like to highlight. First, if you look at the bottom row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots were actually detrimental to our margins in 2011 through 2013. This is due to the fact that our impairment and fair value processes typically resulted in gross margins in the low teens; and it is only after the benefit of several years of ASP growth that closings on those lots represent a slight benefit to our performance. As with any legacy lots, the margin profile improves over time assuming their home selling prices are increasing even modestly each year.","Second, if you look at the second row of the chart, you will see that the legacy lots are decreasing as a percentage of our overall closings. In fact, closings on legacy lots represent 72% of our total closings in 2011, but had fallen to 38% in 2015 and will drop even further in 2016 and the years beyond.","And finally, I would highlight that the margins on our unimpaired land purchases remain almost as high as our legacy positions, reflecting the benefit of the investment discipline we instituted as part of value creation.","Given the margin profile of our total land portfolio and our ongoing value creation initiatives, we continue to target gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 22% for the full year.","Moving past gross margins, our SG&A in the first quarter was $191 million or 13.7% of home sale revenues, compared with $161 million last year or 14.8% of home sale revenues. The increase in our total spend is due primarily the hiring of additional field resources to manage a 41% increase in the number of homes we have under production, plus approximately $4 million of charges associated with the Wieland acquisition.","Given that Q1 is a seasonal low point for our deliveries, SG&A spend will certainly decrease as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, but we also expect that dollar spend will gradually trend lower in subsequent quarters. As such, we expect full year SG&A spend of approximately $730 million or approximately 10% of home sale revenues.","Turning to financial services, first quarter pre-tax reported income was $10 million, which compares to $5 million last year. The increase is due primarily to the higher closing volumes generated through our homebuilding operations. Our capture rate for the period was 81%, compared with 82% last year.","Looking at our income taxes, our first quarter expense of $35 million represents an effective tax rate of 29.5%, which is below our guidance of 38%. During the quarter, the company realized approximately $10 million of net favorable adjustments related to the settlement of certain state tax matters. Going forward, we expect our normalized rate for the remaining quarters in 2016 to be consistent with our previous guidance of 38%.","Finishing up on the income statement, our Q1 net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share, compared with prior year net income of $55 million or $0.15 per share. $83 million is our highest reported first quarter net income in a decade providing further confirmation that we've gotten off to a very good start to the year.","Looking at our controlled lot positions, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase in the quarter, which represents an average of roughly 160 lots per community approved. We continue to focus on smaller, faster turning communities. However, given that most of the land positions we're putting under control are raw, we still estimate it will take 12 months to 18 months before a community will typically come online. At quarter-end we had approximately 146,000 lots under control, of which of 30% were controlled via option.","During the quarter, we spent $262 million on land acquisitions, which does include our purchase of the Wieland assets. Based on our Q1 land acquisition spend, we're on track with our prior guidance of investing approximately $1.2 billion, excluding Wieland, from land acquisitions in 2016. This estimate assumes we can continue to identify projects that meet our disciplined underwriting guidelines and return thresholds.","Consistent with our value creation priorities, we continue to return funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. After curtailing stock repurchases in Q4 of 2015 because of activities surrounding the Wieland transaction, we reinstated our buyback programs and look to be a consistent and systematic participant in the market for our shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares for $50 million or $16.36 per share.","We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash, which includes funds raised through our February senior note offering. We plan to use approximately $465 million of our cash to retire bonds which would mature in May of this year.","Our debt-to-total capital ratio at quarter-end was 39%, compared with 30% at the end of 2015. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the May bond repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio drops to 35%.","For the quarter, we operated from 709 communities, which is up 16% from the same period last year. The increase is higher than our guidance range of 8% to 10%, but reflects a slower closeout rate for our existing communities as opposed to an acceleration in new store openings. As such, we expect the year-over-year change in community count will come back in line with our previous guidance as we move through the year. And finally, our quarter-end backlog of 8,755 homes is valued at $3.4 billion, which represent increases of 15% and 31% respectively over the prior year.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall for some additional comments.","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As both Richard and Bob have mentioned this morning, our financial results demonstrate that 2016 is shaping up to be an inflection point for the company. Reflective of actions we've taken over the past several years, we've transitioned the business to deliver more growth, but without introducing excess risk.","For the past five-plus years, we've been methodically altering our risk profile by selling off unproductive land parcels and moving through long-lived assets that have been a drag on the balance sheet. Over the same period, we've reinvested in shorter duration, high-margin communities that have generated high returns and driven the financial gains over the past few years.","Having been in the field for over a decade and now part of the senior leadership team for the past few years, I fully appreciate the change we've undergone in pursuing the value creation strategy and the benefits we've captured. As we transition to responsible growth, my focus is on ensuring we capture additional operating efficiencies while continuing our disciplined investment process. This means delivering more volume in a profitable, responsible and risk-adjusted way, and avoiding the trap of chasing growth for growth sake.","During my field visits, I have and will continue to drive on the point that we're running a business designed to deliver through-cycle returns; and this demand is efficiently growing pre-tax income while intelligently investing in the business.","Now looking at our homebuilding operations, we had 7,909 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, of which 27% were spec. Consistent with our previous guidance, we purposely increased spec production heading into the spring selling season to help manage and smooth our overall production cadence.","With spec sales tracking to plan and finished specs continuing to average well below one per community, we're right where we wanted to be during this busy time of the spring selling season. After several months of strong spec starts and now having a large and growing backlog of sold homes, we've already started reducing the number of specs we put into production.","Looking at demand conditions for the quarter, we are very pleased with activity in the marketplace these past few months. As you might expect, with the 10% increase in sign-ups for the period, we generally saw positive traffic and demand conditions across the country during the quarter; and I would add that this trend has continued into the first few weeks of April.","In summary, the feedback I've received from our operators during my recent market visits is consistent with what we see in the data. The selling season has gotten off to a very good start.","Taking this down to a regional level, on the East Coast overall demand was solid in the quarter and gotten better as you move from North to South. Consistent with the trend over the last several quarters, we continue to see stronger demand in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. We are excited about the long-term opportunities we see in the South, particularly in the Southeast, given the migration trends, buyer preferences and land availability. It is one of the reasons why we were interested in the Wieland assets. Looking at the middle third of the country, we saw broad-based improvement in demand through the Midwest.","With sign-ups climbing over 30% for the quarter, winter weather conditions were a little easier at the start of this year compared with 2015, but we are optimistic that the higher sign-ups for the quarter reflect a more fundamental improvement in demand.","Dropping down into Texas, on a year-over-year basis, sign-ups were essentially flat as exceptional strength in Dallas was offset by softer demand in Houston and San Antonio. Houston demand improved as we move through the quarter and the market has performed better than I think many were expecting.","And finally, looking out to our Western markets, we continue to experience good demand, particularly in some of our bigger markets including Northern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. We have some new communities open in Las Vegas; and it is great to see the market responding favorably to these new locations.","Given the differences and market dynamics that can exist at the local level, it can be tough to generalize, but we would say that demand continues to improve and that communities located closer to the city center fair better in terms of sales prices and paces.","The inventory of homes available for sale remains tight in most of our markets; and at least on the new home side it will likely remain that way for a while given the limited supply of finished lots available. I've already met some of you at conferences earlier this year, and I look forward to meeting more of you as the year progresses.","Let me turn the call back to Richard. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan. In summary, we had an excellent quarter. And given our strong backlog and growing production pipeline are well-positioned to have an excellent year. The work we've done since value creation began in 2011 has responsibly positioned PulteGroup to be a through-cycle performer, which is why we look forward to the future with optimism.","I want to close by thanking our terrific PulteGroup employees who despite the public distractions these past few weeks have and continue to do a fantastic job staying focused and delivering for our customers. You're the best team in the business and I could not be more proud to work side-by-side with you.","Let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Hey. Thanks, Richard. We'll open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up.","Carol, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question this morning comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Susan.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Susan.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","I just wanted to start off by talking a little bit about the conversion rate. You clearly did see some improvement in the quarter there, but it sounds like there's still some more that we could see coming through as we move through the year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what were the puts and takes that allowed you to get the incremental move-up and yet what's still sort of holding you back? And how should we think about the trends for the year?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We've talked about that as something we're striving to do. We still have a challenging entitlement process. And so, as we go through the year it's our expectation we'll continue to see improvement relative to last year, but that we won't get back to historical averages, at least not during 2016.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then I also wondered if you could just give an update on the Wieland acquisition. Clearly, that's starting to come together, but just a bit more detail on how that's progressing?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Susan. It's Richard. The Wieland acquisition is progressing well. The teams are moving through the integration process as expected. We had, what, about two-and-a-half months in the quarter of total activity from the brand, but it's going well. We have an excellent team focused on integration; and we're pleased with the way it's going so far. So it's early yet, but so far so good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone; and nice quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question I had was just going back to the order trends and by component, community count and sales pace. I believe you said that community count was better than expected due to lower closeout rates during the quarter, but you expect 2Q to get back to original guidance. So just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right that the original was for the first half community count to be up 8% to 10% versus 4Q end?","And also from a absorption standpoint roughly flat year-over-year, and I believe you had expected Wieland to maybe have a little bit of a negative impact and a slight overall decline in absorption. If being flat versus that original slight decline was also related to the slower closeout of the older communities, then could we expect that original expectation to reassert itself in the second quarter as well?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A lot there, Mike. I think to answer your first question, yes, your memory is correct. So we were 8% to 10% Q2 year-over-year and then 10% to 15% year-over-year in the back half of the year. And what we're saying is we think we'll get back to that range of growth period-over-period.","As to absorption paces, we did say coming into the year that Wieland would likely have an impact on our absorption paces, because it moves a little bit slower than our traditional Pulte business; and in fact that's what we saw. So we highlighted that you had an 8% increase in first-time and 4% and 5% decreases in move-up and active adult. And if you take Wieland out \u2013 and that's a net 5% down, 8.4% to 8.0% in terms of absorption paces \u2013 if you take Wieland out, we go up to 8.4%. So essentially we're flat ex the Wieland business.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Also on the gross margins, a little bit better than we were looking for, but you reiterated your full year outlook on a net basis. So just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about it the right way in terms of the interest amortization, how should we think about that for the year, as well as any moving parts that were maybe better than expected pre-interest?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think we've given guidance, 21.5% to 22%. We're reiterating that. Coming into the year we had said Wieland would influence our margins by about 70 basis points for the year. We still think that's a pretty good number. We had given quarterly estimates on that; and it was 100 basis points in the first quarter, 70 basis points in the second, 50 basis points in the third and fourth. And we were a little bit less impactful, in the first quarter it was only 80 basis points, but we think through the year that it's still about 70 basis points. So coming into the year, we said, look, we've got higher land and labor construction costs and that will be offset by interest increases. That's exactly what we saw in the first quarter.","I think you can expect to continue to see that through the balance of 2016; again, within that annual range of 21.5% to 22%. Obviously the financing we did here in the first quarter took our leverage up, took our interest spend up. So for the first time in a long time, our cash spend is a little bit higher than our interest expense. That won't influence 2016. It will have some influence on 2017 and beyond. But I guess the only thing I'd point out to that end is, paying down the debt that we'll do in the second quarter, there's a net add of about $500 million year-over-year. That's roughly 5%, 5.5%. So it's not a huge incremental interest increase as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. The first question is on order pricing; pretty strong here. I was wondering if you could give us a breakout of how much of that was mix and how much of that was organic price increases?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","John, this is Richard. Most of it was mix. We certainly got some price in the quarter. Bob indicated that we had improvements in both option impact as well as lot premium impact. So certainly some of it was price, but the majority of it was mix, reflective of the investments that we made over the past few years. We've been quite clear that the majority of our investments have gone to that move-up category. So that was the majority of it. There was also a little impact from the Wieland backlog coming in. So you see the backlog ASPs expanding pretty dramatically; and that's primarily due to mix with a little bit of Wieland and some price.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up I think you guys indicated that the Houston market seemed to improve somewhat throughout the quarter. Was there a particular price point where you saw most of that improvement?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Hey, John. It's Ryan. We actually saw the Houston market recover probably better than expected the further that we moved through the quarter. The lower price points certainly performed better and we saw a little bit of slowness in the higher end price points in Houston.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Trey Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is actually Trey on for Steve. So my first question is on your gross margin in the quarter you definitely did a lot better than we were looking for, with you almost reaching 22%. And we're wondering how with your year-end margin guidance remaining the 21.5% to 22% range, how you're expecting a quarterly cadence to develop when normally we'd expect lowest gross margin in the first quarter and the highest gross margin at the end of the year?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Trey, this is Richard. I'll answer that. We're not providing quarterly margin guidance. We're very pleased with our margins. I think the takeaway is that we continue to run the business focused on high returns, but margins are holding up; and we're pleased to reiterate the guidance that we started the year with.","Trey Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So you would expect obviously the 21.5% to 22%, everything to stay within that range for the year though?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That are expectation, yes.","Trey Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then secondly, what was your land development spend in the quarter?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was about a little over $300 million. So pretty consistent with historic spend patterns where we've been spending roughly dollar for dollar land acq and land development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. This is actually Matthew Bouley on for Mike. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about the legacy land beyond what you're planning to deliver. So just how are you thinking about bringing specifically your inactive legacy land back? Have you seen signs that demand is pushing out a bit into outer locations? And then how should we think about potential margin impacts from that? For example, would there be any more interest capitalized into the older land?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","To the final question, the answer is no. The answer is, it doesn't get capitalized into older positions that way. But I guess the way I would answer that is we don't have a tremendous amount of what I would characterize as outer ring assets. If you think back, we certainly have a large lot position associated with some of the larger, older Del Webb positions. It's that slide 11 in the deck. And we've talked about that for years that it will just take us time to work through that.","Good news is strong margins on that business, good return on incremental investment. We own the land (34:52) now we're just development dollars, sticks and bricks. So we do okay on that. It's also worth mentioning that over the last, gosh, I guess it's five years now, we've been pretty active in selling some of those older, what I would characterize as, challenged assets. So if you think about it, over the last four years or five years, it's certainly more than $400 million probably of land sales that moved a lot of those, again what I'd characterize as, challenged assets. So our book today doesn't have a lot of that.","Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. Thank you. And then secondly, just on SG&A, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the work force investments that you mentioned? So just geographies and which types of labor were you targeting? Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Matthew, this is Richard. Primarily that's field resources to get home some production field managers or superintendents that manage our business. We had a very large increase in homes under production, 41%; and that takes incremental people to help manage the process. So most of it was related to construction resources to get those homes into production for deliveries later this year.","And geography agnostic. We've had a fairly significant ramp-up in land spend in the last few years. And as we've indicated, 2016 would be a pivot year for volume for the company and you're beginning to see that come through the system; and that's what those dollars are for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the solid quarter. I'm not sure...","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ivy.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","...if Deb Still is in the room or not, but I was hoping for an update on Pulte Mortgage with respect to trends related to the (36:50) headwinds, because we're hearing concerns about closings that might be impacted in future quarters because of uncertainty around the rules, especially in the secondary market, as opposed to those loans being sold directed to Fannie\/Freddie they don't seem to be as problematic or accepting it and not pushing back. So any concern about 2Q and 3Q closings?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Deb's not here, but I'll take that one, Ivy. We do sell direct. And so I would tell you we are not seeing that as an impediment to our closing process. More broadly for the market, I can't comment on.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Got it. All right. Great. And, Bob, just in terms of my follow-up, if you can give us an update on some of the higher price points around the market, if you're seeing any change in activity? We've heard depending on the city obviously high-end is defined differently. So I don't know if you see that, for example, in Atlanta about $600,000 or $700,000, are you seeing changes in absorption paces for that higher-end price point?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ivy, this is Richard. I'll take that one. We are not. We're seeing good activity in the higher price points around the system. Again, we have a modest number of really high price point homes, $600,000, $700,000, $800,000, relative to our ASPs in the mid-to-high $300,000s overall, but we're seeing good demand. And most of that for us is in Northern California, some in D.C., excuse me, some of the higher-priced markets in general. But overall, so far so good in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Przybylski from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Paul Przybylski - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thank you. This is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen East. First, you mentioned the Del Webb orders were down on community closeouts. I was wondering if you had heard anything from the field though about equity market volatility negatively impacting that buyer?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Hey, Paul. This is Ryan. Yeah, we've seen a little bit of traffic slowdown at our Del Webb communities, which we think is directly related to the market volatility. We saw that lessen as we move through the quarter and some of the market volatility started to come back into normal ranges. We're quite pleased with what we're seeing out of our Del Webb markets right now.","Paul Przybylski - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. And then you spoke to Houston improving through the quarter, but now Houston has its own weather problem. What kind of impact do you think that would have on 2Q conversion rates? And then how long after we have a significant weather event like that does it take demand to rebound?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Yeah. Great question. Houston's obviously dealing with some weather challenges right now. We haven't gotten a full assessment of the extent of the damage. Many of the communities are still underwater and having to struggle getting out of their homes. We don't expect it to have much of an impact at all on our Q2, probably it's fairly a small impact as we move into Q3.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Paul, just to add to that, remember, Houston is roughly 4% or 5% of our total company volume. So when you add it collectively, obviously we're paying attention to it, but we're not too concerned about it. And we do still have seven months, eight months to watch that for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. Good morning, everybody. First question, looking at some of the regions, Northeast down a bit more than last year, strong Midwest, strong Southeast. Relative to absorption, is it okay to think that that's generally sort of moving in line with the community count or is there any more pronounced demand swing in any of those sort of outside move regions in the quarter from an order perspective?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jack, we're seeing our Western markets do quite well. We think this is reflective of some of the places where the local economies are strong, as well as where we have great investment. We've also seen the Midwest perform very well year-over-year. So those are the two spots that I would highlight.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then a follow-up on the G&A guidance on the dollar. I think, Richard, you had said a lot of that is field-type labor. Is the significant improvement or implied improvement in the G&A ratio into the end of the year, is that more a function of sort of flexing the overhead spend around the construction and then maybe bringing that back down, or is it all conversion rate improvement or is it sort of a mix?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll speak to the first part of that and maybe ask Bob to comment a little bit more. From an overall absorption perspective, we're definitely going to get a conversion rate improvement as we go through the year, as you might expect, with all the homes in production that will be flowing through. There is also, however, a little bit of a total dollar improvement. Maybe Bob can speak to that.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We've talked about this in the past, and for the most part our dollar spend is relatively fixed. We don't run sales commissions through SG&A, and so we have other than production level and footprint expansion. So if we're opening a bunch of new communities, there are costs associated with that. So as we look at the balance of the year, the guidance would imply another $540 million of spend, which translates to about $180 million a quarter; and I would suggest that's kind of how we'll spend it. It's not going to be largely variable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Will.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Will.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In terms of going back to \u2013 this was asked a couple of different ways \u2013 variances in your gross margin expectations. Can you talk about how your expectations for lumber inflation, as well as labor inflation from, again, a gross margin expectation have moved since you reported your last quarter?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We had said coming into the year that with a relatively benign commodity market, but a relatively tight labor market that we saw our construction costs up about 2%; and that was largely labor and we still see that. We've got pretty good visibility into six months of costs. And so, in terms of our backlog, we have, like I said, pretty good visibility into what our cost structure is going to be on that. So we haven't seen that move materially since we last talked.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Will, just to be clear, I'm not sure I heard you correct at the end of your question there, but we are not changing our gross margin expectations. We're reiterating them in the same range. So just to be clear.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thank you. And then just want to follow-up in terms of backlog conversion. What's your confidence level going into kind of the peak production season for closings in the second quarter and third quarter that we don't have any more, I'll call it, disruption? I know you guys have ramped up spec count. Can you talk about some other preventive actions you may have taken to improve that confidence level?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Will, this is Richard. I'll take that. Certainly, spec count is definitely helpful to us. We've also paid a lot of attention to the overall labor market in total when we saw some of the disruption last year, and have done our best to add incremental vendors where we could overall. So we're pleased with the progress we've made.","And just to be clear, Bob mentioned this earlier on the answer to a question, we expect improvement relative to prior year conversion rates, but not back to old historical levels; and that's primarily due to the fact that our cycle times are extended. We indicated on one of our calls last year that they were up eight days or nine days in total, and we're still seeing that. So we've improved our processes overall, but we're not expecting to get back to historical ranges even though we will be improving relative to prior year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ken.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Slide 12, very interesting. I have two questions. Related to this slide, what can we infer from the outlook I guess, or how do you guys kind of balance where you think \u2013 if you're talking about gross margins, which we can see on the non-adjusted side, having peaked in 2014. Could you kind of talk about the deltas that are associated with each of those pre-interest? I mean, do you have higher interest expense in the legacy or is there any accounting nuances that we should be familiar with there if we think about the mix aging through time as you deplete those legacy land positions?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ken, fair question. The answer is no. Our interest gets applied across our entire production portfolio. And so, when we manage the business, these are the numbers we're managing against. So this is sort of book value, historical cost versus selling price for each. So as you look at this, interest doesn't really influence it.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Ken, this is Richard. I would just add I think what you should take away is that the investments we've made the past four or five years are at really nice margins. We're very pleased with that. And that even though it will be declining as a percentage of total production, the legacy lots will continue to be a tailwind for margins going forward. Those are the two key points we're trying to drive here.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood; and I think you guys did very well by presenting it this way. My next question is a bit more regional, specifically about California. It's not the biggest market for you guys, but could you talk about the trends you're seeing in San Francisco given perhaps slowdowns we're seeing in VC funding and how that might impact kind of your points that you have up in San Francisco? And if you could, describe a rate of foreign buyers, if that's an item that you have been tracking in California or Seattle in general? Thank you very much.","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Hey, Ken. This is Ryan. We've actually seen exceptional strength in our Northern California market, and it's really reflective of the wonderful investments that we've made. Really focused on the core employment areas in the East and South Bay. We've got a lot of infill opportunities in infill communities that we've invested in; and we're seeing excellent demand that is being driven by what's been a strong labor market, as well as very tight supply.","So we're obviously watching some of the things that are going on in the technology sector, but we've stayed away from some of the outer locations. As you move further away from the Bay Area, we think those are some of the areas that will obviously be hit first if the labor market there tightens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. This is actually Michael Eisen on for Bob this morning. I just had a quick question about the pace of ASP growth and your order growth. They both were very strong. Wondering how much of this is attributable to community count shift and how much is price appreciation?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Mike, this is Richard. The majority of it is the continued mix shift that we've had in the business. ASPs are rising strongly because of our investments over the past couple of years with mix shift. We are also getting some benefit out of the Wieland business integrating into our backlog which raises our ASP some. But the vast majority of it's from our core business continuing to move higher. So, as you note, our ASP in backlog is over $380,000 now. And as Bob indicated, we'll be delivering into that number slowly and steadily through this year and into next.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then when you guys talk about the delayed closure of some community counts, are any of these at significantly higher or lower price points that would cause fluctuation quarter-over-quarter as we look forward into the rest of the year as those close out?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Richard again. No, and this is one of the reasons we don't love community count as a metric. We've explained this before. You might have a handful of legacy communities that had one or two sales that drifted from Q4 into Q1, and those get counted as a new \u2013 or excuse me, a community in our convention. So no, there's no significant impact on either ASPs or anything else related to the few closeout communities that we had some activity in, in Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Kim from Wellington Management. Your line is open.","Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP","Morning. Excellent results. Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gabe.","Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP","Thank you. My question is on slide number 11, and this is a slide that we've looked at for a couple of quarters now; legacy Del Webb versus new active adult investments.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Go ahead, Gabe.","Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP","Okay, super. So what I'm looking at here \u2013 so I appreciate the purpose of the slide. On the left-hand side we have low older Del Webb and then on the right-hand side we have newer Del Webb; and newer is always better than older. So the gross margin is 10% higher. And then when you sort of look at the bottom of the table, it says estimated remaining lot supply, 12 years for the older; estimated remaining lot supply for the newer is five years. If we were to translate this slide to a dollars basis, how would that 12 years versus five years look, do you think? The turnover, not in relation to the units, but the dollars of inventory. How does it look?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not sure I'm following you, Gabe. Are you talking about the total balance sheet investment on the left side versus the right, Gabe?","Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP","Yes. Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know if we have that at the tip of our tongue. We could certainly work on that and potentially get back to you. I think it's...","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Gabe, it's complicated because you've got options lots in here versus owned lots. So are you talking about committed capital, spent capital, in particular the newer Del Webbs. For the older ones typically we own them, but for the newer ones we've tried to structure them with option takedowns. So let us give that some thought. And maybe when we present this either at the next investor conference or next quarter, we'll try and get some color in there for you.","Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP","Okay. But the question really is the dollars because we've heavily written down the stuff on the left; and the stuff on the right, maybe not so much. But the turnover expressed not in years, but in dollars. That's kind of what I'm interested in getting a sense for.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Gabe, I think it's fair to say that the dollars associated are not gigantic for the company based on the total investment. And to your point the write-downs, which is reflective on the following slide, slide 12, which shows the sort of legacy lots, which many of these Del Webb lots would be included in that as a margin tailwind going forward.","Gabriel A. Kim - Wellington Management Co. LLP","Okay. It'd be good to see that number. Nice numbers. Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I realize you guys are hesitant and restricted in what you want to say about the Pulte family's recent letter, so I'm going to be careful how I word this. But if the board were to identify a CEO candidate before next year, could we expect to see a transition before the expected or the previously announced retirement date for Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Buck, this is Richard. The board plans to undertake a thorough review, as we talked about in our public disclosures. Sometimes CEO searches can be lengthy. So it's certainly expected that I'm going to fill out my announced term through May of 2017, but we'll keep you focused as that develops. And I think the board's been real clear that they're going to take a deliberate process here, and they intend to follow it.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And I understand the current situation is a little complicated, but would the board seek to consult with the Pulte family on the next potential CEO candidate? And also are there any allowances that are in the new SG&A guidance related to your expected retirement?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's nothing in our SG&A guidance related to expected retirement, I can tell you that. And I'll just reiterate that the board has a special committee of independent directors that they formed to look for my successor. And I just want to ensure every investor until the day I walk out of here, our entire team is focused on continuing to successfully execute value creation. And our board has a really good process underway; and you can expect that will be revealed over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. And I really do appreciate the slide 12, it's helpful and interesting. Was hoping to get a sense of how many of your total existing lots now would be legacy lots?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, looking at the portfolio, it's relatively modest outside of Del Webb. And in the Del Webb position, you can see there's 36,000 lots. If you look at slide 11, there's 36,000 lots in that book that we would characterize as those legacy assets.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Not wanting to get too technical, but I noticed that was prior to 2012. This is somewhat different date frames, but...","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is. But they're pretty close to the same in that context.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Okay, great. And I think you answered this question when you said that the legacy lots would continue to be a tailwind. But the legacy lots that have been sold more recently, would they be meaningfully different than the remaining lots that you would have as legacy lots? Have you been selling much better legacy lots as opposed to those that are less well-positioned?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but we're not cherrypicking which lots to sell.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Mark, this is Richard. To add to something Bob said earlier, there's not a big block of legacy lots that are sitting and waiting to be sold off. There are a lot of positions that are primarily Del Webb that have eight years, 10 years, 12 years of life left that will be worked through at a reasonable pace over the next eight years, 10 years, 12 years that will continue to impact in a positive way, as you can see, margins going forward. But there's not going to be a big slog (57:15) coming through at any one time. To Bob's point, we've been very deliberate with regard to the way we're managing those assets; and we've done a nice job with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. There's been some pretty good discussion already about your delivery schedules and what you're doing to manage those and the additional field personnel and how we should expect improvement. I wanted to dig in a little bit to the labor market itself, the subcontractor pool and what you're seeing out there. Are those issues gradually easing over time? Are pay scales rising? And is that helping to solve a problem? Do you see new sources of labor coming into the subcontractor pool? What are you seeing out there? It doesn't seem to be showing up in the macro data in terms of higher wage rates. So what are you seeing out there and how do you expect that to trend over the course of the year?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Nishu, this is Ryan. We've seen stability in the labor market. Certainly, labor supply is tight. It has been, and we expect that it will continue to be tight as we move through the year. We have not seen a huge influx of new labor come into the industry. And we're going to continue to run our business much like we have in the past; and we don't expect a significant change. So it's going to be stable.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And in terms of its impact on your cost structure, obviously there were some pressures last year for you folks and I think for a number of builders. How has that trended more recently and has that cost profile come back in line? And are you able to recover any cost increases through the pace of home price appreciation?","Ryan R. Marshall - President","Well, certainly we've seen labor rates up. We've talked about that. We've seen input costs, commodity costs generally down or favorable; not necessarily down, but favorable, so not increasing. And obviously we are seeking to maximize price across the buying spectrum in all cases. And so, we have seen price appreciation. I would suggest it was certainly enough to cover the incremental input costs.","Operator","And our final question today comes from the line of Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center. Your line is open.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Sorry if I missed it, but what was the interest rate on the new debt you guys issued?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We did two tranches, a five-year piece and a 10-year piece. And the 10-year piece was 5.5%, but through five-year it was 4.25%.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Okay. Yeah. I think that's all I have. Thanks.","Richard J.

My name is Jody, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce today's speakers, Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations for PulteGroup. Please go ahead.","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Jody, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you all for participating in today's call to discuss PulteGroup's 2012 fourth quarter financial results. On the call today are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Schweninger, Vice President and Controller. And also joining us today is Jim Ossowski. Jim will be assuming the title of Vice President, Finance and Controller. Jim will be replacing Mike, who is heading to Florida and assuming a new position as Area Vice President of Finance for our Southeast Area.","Before we begin, copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call had been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today's call will be available on the site later today. Also, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including references to gross margins, reflecting certain adjustments, are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the press release, and as an appendix to this call's presentation slide deck.","Finally, today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you this morning to have the opportunity to discuss PulteGroup's very positive fourth quarter and full-year results.","2012 was a year of important accomplishments for the company, both in terms of the financial results we delivered and the progress we made against the business initiatives we have been pursuing.","As many of you know, 24 months ago, we launched our value creation program, which has served to dramatically reorient our organization, our strategies and our operating processes as we seek to improve our business performance and drive higher returns on invested capital.","At the offset, our activities were tactical, as we deployed new processes and tools to support the value engineering, should [ph] costing and strategic pricing initiatives we have discussed across the organization.","Building on these early efforts, we are now partway through implementing broader initiatives, relating to common plan management and product and purchasing zones. All these activities relate directly to our stated goals of expanding gross margins, leveraging overheads, accelerating inventory turns and driving improved capital efficiency. By improving PulteGroup's performance in each of these key metrics, we aim to deliver superior returns on invested capital, which we believe will drive greater returns for our shareholders.","While the U.S. housing market is clearly getting better, the differentiating -- and differentiating market improvement from our own internal initiatives can be challenging, we feel the relative gains we have delivered in operating margins these past several quarters, point to the real company-specific progress we are making. At this stage, we are extremely pleased with the results we have delivered, and I remain excited about the opportunities we continue to identify for additional gains in the future.","I look back on the year and the overall progress we have made with a sense of satisfaction. That is not to say we are satisfied, but certainly encouraged by the successes we realized in delivering better financial and operating results throughout the year.","In terms of financial performance, we reported net income of $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with a net loss of $210 million in 2011. As detailed in our press releases, reported results for 2012 and 2011 included certain net charges of $70 million and $236 million, respectively. Whether you assess the year-over-year gains with or without charges, it is clear that we are driving a lot more of each revenue dollar to the bottom line.","All the more encouraging to us, is that the net income gain was the result of improvements in the fundamental business drivers, on which we have been focused. More specifically, PulteGroup's full-year 2012 adjusted gross margins, increased by 300 basis points over last year. Our progress has been steady, and we have been able to deliver 8 quarters in a row of sequential margin gains. We can't assure an uninterrupted string of quarter-to-quarter increases every year, but we do expect margins to move higher for 2013, assuming housing demand doesn't experience a dramatic change for the worse.","Layering on top of the expansion and adjusted gross margin in 2012, we were also able to realize a substantial improvement in overhead leverage, as SG&A as a percent of home sale revenues fell almost 200 basis points from 2011.","As we have discussed on prior calls, our goal is to improve returns by expanding margins, controlling costs and accelerating inventory turns. We've also explained that over the near-term, we could best achieve our goals by focusing on growth within our existing communities. Our results speak to our success as we realized a 25% increase in full-year net new orders from 4% fewer communities. Said another way, in 2012, we generated almost 4,000 more sign-ups and an additional $1.5 billion in sign-up value from approximately 30 fewer communities.","I'm not sure such jumps in absorption pace for a community are repeatable every year, but the obvious benefits we were able to drive in terms of cash flow and returns were dramatic. This is best exemplified by the fact that we were able to generate sufficient cash flow during the year to fund our operations, pay down almost $600 million of our senior notes and still increase our cash position by $292 million. Our focus on running a more efficient operation also led to a substantial increase in the company's return on invested capital. We still have a lot to accomplish as we work toward achieving acceptable returns, but I am confident that we are on the right track.","Looking ahead to 2013, we have every reason to expect that housing has, indeed, turned the corner and that industry sales in 2013 can continue to move higher as pent-up demand is released.","That being said, we will keep a cautious eye toward any potential negative impact from the government budget debates, GSE reform discussions and a host of other government policy issues that could development in the coming quarters. Despite these potential disruptions for the current momentum, we are bullish on macro housing demand for 2013 and beyond. The combination of incredibly low mortgage rates, continued increases in rental rates and especially rising home prices and very low and likely to stay low inventory levels for housing, lead us to believe that 2013 will be a better year for U.S. housing than 2012.","Given this improved outlook on the macro market and our confidence in our ability to generate better returns on new capital deployed, during our planning process, we authorized an additional $250 million of investment in land and related development per year in both 2013 and 2014. This incremental capital raises our planned land spend to an estimated $1.2 billion for each of the next 2 years compared with $925 million in 2012.","Given our improving construction efficiencies, stronger balance sheet and expectations for improving demand, we are comfortable putting incremental dollars into the business. We will, however, do so in a prudent fashion and continue to use our risk-weighted, return-based criteria when evaluating any new projects. We are not going to chase volume but intend to invest intelligently, with a focus on improving overall returns and ultimately shareholder value. For all the progress we've made in the quarter and over the past 2 years, we still see opportunities to improve our fundamental operating and, in turn, financial results. The gains we have made to date, however, confirm we are focused on the right strategy.","Let me now turn the call over to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. As Richard discussed, we are continuing to pursue the initiatives that are driving today's improved operating performance, which we believe have established a foundation for sustained gains over time.","Looking at our income statement, we're pleased to report that we generated fourth quarter earnings of $59 million or $0.15 per share, which includes net charges of approximately $73 million or $0.19 per share.","The net charges include $81 million of mortgage and debt repurchase charges, which were partially offset by $8 million of tax benefits, associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.","In the fourth quarter, net new orders totaled 3,926 homes, which represents an increase of 27% over last year. Our increased sign ups for the period were generated from fewer communities, as we realized better absorption paces within our existing project.","Consistent with the first 3 quarters of the year, we saw improved demand for each of our brands in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the 27% aggregate increase in net new orders included increases of 41% at our Pulte communities, 2% at our Centex communities and 38% at our Del Webb communities.","We're particularly pleased by the increase in sales paces at our Del Webb communities. As we have discussed, the Del Webb buyer has been slower to return to the market, given the discretionary nature of their purchase, their need to sell an existing property and their fiscal conservatism. Over the course of 2012, we saw a very positive trend developing in the demand for Del Webb homes.","On a year-over-year basis Webb sign-ups increased 6% in Q1; 17% in Q2; 23% in Q3; and 38% in the most recent quarter.","The demand trend we saw in 2012 is encouraging, given how much volume these communities can generate in a year.","The mix of our orders did not change materially in the quarter as Pulte represented 45% of sign-up volumes, Centex was 27% and Del Webb increased slightly to 28%. Orders for the quarter were generated from 670 communities, which is down 4% from last year, slightly better than the guidance we provided at the start of 2012.","We currently project that our community count will decline by 10% to 15% in 2013 before turning up in 2014, as we invest the incremental capital Richard mentioned.","As we have demonstrated this year, multiple factors influence sales volumes, including absorption pace per community and the underlying size of the given community. The latter point is especially relevant to us, given that we often maintain larger communities, particularly within our Del Webb brand.","Walking down the income statement for the fourth quarter, home sale revenues were $1.5 billion, an increase of 27% compared with last year. The increase in revenue was driven by a 20% increase in closing to 5,154 homes, in combination with a 6% increase in average selling price to $287,000.","The mix of closings for the quarter is consistent with the sign up trends we saw throughout 2012, which resulted in the higher sales from Pulte Homes branded communities. Closings in the fourth quarter breakdown as follows: 47% from Pulte, 27% from Centex and 26% from Del Webb. The increase in our average selling price reflects the continued shift in our product mix from the first-time buyer towards the move-up buyer, as well as price increases realized within our market.","Land sale revenues were $37 million in the quarter, as we continued to opportunistically divest non-core land assets.","For the full year, we disposed of $107 million of non-core land assets. It's difficult to forecast land sales, but we'll continue to pursue such transactions when appropriate.","In the fourth quarter, we reported an adjusted gross margin of 21.8%, which is an increase of 320 basis points over their comparable prior-year period. On a sequential basis, margins grew 20 basis points.","Similar to prior quarters, gross margin benefited from company-specific and industry-wide factors, including the improved demand in pricing environment, further expansion of our move-up buyer business, our strategic pricing initiatives and our ongoing efforts to lower house construction cost.","We typically focus on adjusted gross margins, but I want to call your attention to the capitalized interest component of our homebuilder cost of sales. For the year, we amortized $224 million of previously capitalized interest costs. Looking at 2013, we expect capitalized interest expense amortization for the full-year to increase to approximately $260 million.","Our continued focus on improving our capital efficiency and inventory turns means that interest will be relieved from the balance sheet more quickly. It's important to note that we expect our decrease in leverage, and resulting reduction in cash interest cost will result in lower capitalized interest amortization in 2014 and beyond.","In the fourth quarter, we realized further leverage on overheads as SG&A dropped 40 basis points to 9.6% of revenues. In absolute dollars, SG&A for the period increased 21% to $142 million, with the biggest contributor to the increase being incentive compensation, resulting from the companies improved financial results.","We have made meaningful progress on gross margin and SG&A, which have been key focus areas for the company. We will continue to pursue opportunities to drive gross margins higher, while we maintain discipline in controlling our SG&A spend.","Looking further down the income statement, we reported other expenses of $42 million, which includes $32 million of charges, relating to the company's repurchase of $496 million of senior notes during the quarter.","Turning to Financial Services. We originated 3,625 loans, with a principal amount of $829 million in the quarter. Higher loan originations for the period reflect the increase closing volumes from our homebuilding operations, as well as 120-basis-point increase in our capture rate to 83%.","While our underlying mortgage operations continue to operate in a favorable interest rate environment, we recorded a mortgage repurchase reserve adjustment of $49 million, which resulted in our Financial Services reporting a fourth quarter pretax loss of $24 million.","As we have discussed previously, our reserve estimate was based on the assumption that mortgage repurchase requests would continue through 2013.","Based on the trends we experienced in 2012, we have now changed this assumption and extended it by 1 year. As a result, our estimated repurchase obligations now reflects the company's expectation that repurchase requests will continue through 2014.","You will also recall that on last quarter's call, we highlighted that monthly repurchase requests in 2012 were elevated, relative to the assumptions of our reserve estimates.","As you can see on Page 11 of our webcast slide, we experienced a reduction in repurchase requests during the fourth quarter. However, the average number of request in 2012 was still in excess of levels assumed in our previous estimates.","As you can see, monthly put back volumes remain volatile, but the composition in overall profile of the underlying repurchase request has not changed materially. We continue to look for a comprehensive resolution of these issues, but do not have anything to update at this time.","Before we leave Financial Services, I want to highlight some full-year achievements from that business. Looking at the full-year, loan origination volume increased 19% to 11,322 loans, while capture rate increased 340 basis points to 81.9%, helping to drive pretax income of $26 million, despite the $49 million repurchase reserve increase in the fourth quarter.","The increase in capture rate reflects the fact that our consumers in homebuilding operations value the outstanding customer service afforded by our mortgage operation.","Turning to our balance sheet, we've talked a lot about our desire to be more efficient with our capital. During 2012, we made significant headway on this front, including a more capital-efficient land acquisition and development process, a 56% decrease in our spec unit count, including a 66% decrease in our finished spec unit count, the reestablishment of a warehouse line for our mortgage operations and the ongoing sale of non-core land assets.","These actions helped to improve our operating performance and freed up a considerable amount of working capital. As a result, we ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash after paying down $496 million in senior notes during the quarter.","As Richard mentioned, we were able to generate sufficient cash flow during the year to fund our operations, pay down almost $600 million of debt and still increase our cash position by $292 million compared to the end of last year.","Our improved operating results and significant debt paydown during the year helped to further reduce the company's debt and net debt-to-capital ratio to 53% and 32%, respectively. These numbers represent a significant improvement from just 1 year ago, when our reported debt-to-capital was 61% and our net debt-to-capital was 50%.","Richard also mentioned that we have authorized an additional $250 million per year of land and related improvement development spend, bringing our planned investment to approximately $1.2 billion in both 2013 and 2014. This increase is obviously substantial, but we believe it's appropriate, given the improving market demand and the progress we've already made in repositioning our business. I would note that even without the increased investment, we expect to be cash flow positive from operations in both years.","We certainly won't force investment into the system, and all spending will be subject to the underwriting criteria we introduced 18 months ago. It's pleasing to note that our operators have embraced investing under our risk-weighted scoring system, and understand the need to deliver required returns. This investment discipline is now being employed in  a land market that grows increasingly more competitive.","In fact, we recently surveyed our division presidents and embedded in 90% of our markets, we are seeing increased land acquisition activity among private builders, in addition to the ongoing demand for major public competitors. And then a 1\/3 of our market, the increase was considered significant by the local team.","What makes it even more challenging is that in almost 100% of our markets, finished lots and better submarkets are considered scarce for at least the next year or longer. With the run up in competition and land cost, it will be interesting to see the page at which we will be able to invest the incremental capital against our return of criteria.","The good news is that we have the resources to invest. The better news is that I believe we also have the discipline to invest wisely. As Richard said, we aren't chasing volume, so we can afford to be patient and disciplined.","Before turning the call back to Richard, let me review a few final data points. We ended the year with a total of 6,458 homes in backlog, valued at $1.9 billion. We ended the fourth quarter with 5,418 homes under construction, of which 77% were sold and only 23% were spec. And finally, we ended the year with only 503 finished specs on the ground, which, as I've mentioned, represent the drop of 56% from the end of 2011.","Now, let me turn the call back to Richard for his -- some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. As is our practice, before opening the call to questions, I'll provide some additional comments on the demand environment we experienced during the quarter. Broadly speaking, we realized improved demand in just about every market, which drove the 27% increase in the year-over-year sign-ups we reported for the quarter.","More specifically, demand up and down the East Coast remains strong, with double-digit percentage increases in almost every market. We continue to see notable gains reported by our operations in the New England area, the Carolinas and Florida. In fact, exceptional demand in our Florida markets is forcing us to take similar action to that in Phoenix, where we are purposefully slowing our rate of sales, as we focus on maximizing margin over driving volume.","Market conditions in the middle third of the country also showed continuous strength in the quarter. Demand in the Midwest was generally strong, with limited lot supply often being as big an influence of our reported sign-ups as buyer demand. All of our Texas markets posted double-digit gains, with Houston delivering the biggest year-over-year increase in sign-ups during the quarter.","It likely -- It'd likely -- excuse me, won't be new news when I say that our operations out West continue to experience strong demand from Seattle through California and into the Southwest. Consistent with comments we had made earlier, while demand in Arizona remains exceptional, we are continuing to moderate sales to maximize price and to avoid getting too far out ahead of production.","Consistent with the positive demand environment we experienced in the fourth quarter, all of our markets indicated that they were able to raise prices in at least one or more communities during the period.","In addition, 70% of our markets reported that they were able to raise prices in at least 50% or more of their existing communities.","Given the demand strength we saw in the quarter and for all of 2012, you can understand our desire to put additional capital to work in our markets.","We are now 2 years into our value creation work and the supporting initiatives focused on improving margins, leveraging overheads, accelerating inventory turns and utilizing capital more efficiently.","Our annual financial results mark the progress that we are making on each of these metrics. We still have a lot of opportunity and work ahead of us, but we remain focused on improving our fundamental operations everyday.","I want to thank each of our employees for their work in delivering a great buying experience for our customers, while implementing new processes to drive a more efficient homebuilding operation.","It is only through your efforts that we have been able to realize such meaningful gains in PulteGroup's performance.","And finally, this will be Mike Schweninger's last earnings call, as he is taking on a new challenge as Area Vice President of Finance for the recently expanded Southeast Area. Mike has done an outstanding job over the past 4 years as VP and Controller, and we know he will be equally successful in his new role.","We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent in our organization and -- as we have expanded Jim Ossowski's responsibilities, in naming him Vice President, Finance and Controller. Jim has held a number of corporate and field positions during his 11 years with the company, and we look forward to his continued contributions in his new role.","Now let me turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we will open the call for questions, so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining of time of this call, we ask you to limit yourselves to one question and to one follow-up. We know there's some calls following this, so we're going to move to our Q&A as promptly -- as quickly as possible so that we can get to as many questions as possible. Jody, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you'd provide some color into the composition of the big move in gross margin. You picked up 320 basis points. If you could give us some color on what came from mix and what came from home size, that would be helpful.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","It's difficult to break that down by square foot. We don't have that, but what we can say is that the mix shift in closings to the move-up buyer certainly helped. That's our richest margin business. Obviously, market influences that. The good news is that, we think we've been able to take advantage of the market improvement with our pricing initiatives. So obviously, option margin per house is up or option revenue per house is up about $4,000, which is almost a 12% increase. Lot premium is up per house by about $1,400, which is about 20% increase quarter-over-quarter. Again, richer margin business, all at the same time, while incentive dropped 200 basis points from 6.1% last year to 4.1% this year. So all those market factors we're able to take advantage of to the new processes we've put in place. And obviously, the should cost and value engineering efforts that we're undertaking, 17% of our volume has gone through that. And we're excited about the zone concept and our ability to build more consistently and efficiently in our floor plans.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's really helpful. Your dollar value of ASP's went from about $260,000 in the first quarter to $287,000. So you had a nice $25,000, $26,000 pickup. Could you give us some guidance in terms of your expectations for '13 in ASP performance? Obviously, Richard's commentary about tight inventory supplies would suggest you have a lot of upward pricing power. Can we get a magnitude directionally for what you're thinking?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, I think, yes, we did certainly see increases. If you look quarter-over-quarter, we're up 6% to $287,000 on average. If you look at that by brand, Pulte was up about 8% to about $342,000. Centex and Del Webb were about flat year-over-year. But if you look in the backlog, the average selling prices is $299,000, which is up about 11% over the prior year. So obviously, mix is part of that, but pricing is up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Good quarter. Exciting for you. Question, first, on Del Webb. Given that you've got community count  that's actually shrinking, can you help us understand where absorptions are, specifically, for Del Webb? And how does that compare to historical absorption, and maybe prospective pre-boom and where it's been on a longer-term basis?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ivy, this is Richard. One of the things we're excited about is the momentum we saw in the Del Webb business for the quarter. To give you a perspective, we were up 6% in Q1 Del Webb year-over-year, and that grew every quarter to where, in Q4, we were up 38% over prior year. So we really like the trend in that business. And it's following a very typical Del Webb pattern, where that category tends to lag the broader housing market because of the buyer's general conservatism and need to sell a home. So as you know, resale inventory is very low in many markets now, and it's really gotten better and better in that regard over the back half of the year. So we're not surprised to see the Del Webb buyer coming back. And that does give us reason for optimism as we head into '13. Relative to historical trends, however, we are still well below what we may have generated from a typical Del Webb community, historically. I think we've quoted before, some of our larger Del Webb communities in the past, we were able to do 700, 800, 900 units a year. We're still nowhere near that level in any of them. I would say, we're still less than half of that. So depending on how the housing market continues to unfold from here, we think we have a lot of runway there, and one of the real kind of x-factors for PulteGroup group, we believe.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Ivy, it's -- the pace in the fourth quarter of sales is 2.2 a month. So clearly, some room to run there.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","That's very helpful. And then the second question relates to your comments, Richard, on the gross margin going forward. You've spoken in the past about structural changes that you've made. How much of your gross margin improvement, going forward, is going to be contingent on home price inflation, as opposed to the structural improvements and other factors that are driving it, whether it be mix, or the move-up, lower-cost land basis, you're longer land than a lot of your competitors? And so I want to understand how much of your margin expansion is contingent on HPA.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, so, Ivy, a couple of comments here. First of all, the biggest drivers in 2012 are good margin expansion, a combination of a strong reduction in spec inventory. We're seeing much better margins in presale. We're very proud of that because it also helped returns and cash flow, mix shift, as well as the pricing initiatives we mentioned. With regard to the other structural elements, Bob gave a comment just now, I don't know if everybody caught it, but we only had about 17% of our closings in the quarter that had the benefit of what we would call our big structural changes, which relate to value engineering, should costing and more specifically, this notion of common plan management, where we're trying to drive a much higher percentage of our total closings through those efforts. These will be homes that are consumer-designed upfront, value-engineered upfront, if you will. We know they're going to be successful before we put them into sales and to production. And only 17% of our volumes do that. So I would suggest we have a lot of runway to go, with regard to margin improvement from those initiatives. As it relates to how much are we counting on. Obviously, as much as we can drive there. But we're not going to get into the habit of running the business banking on improved demand environment. We want to be cautious. We want to continue to buy A-plus properties. And we think we're demonstrating that we're getting a lot out of our existing assets and we still have a lot to go there.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question has to do with the land spend and your current land inventory with the, I guess, gap in community growth. Certainly, having the long land that you possess is viewed as an asset, but maybe you could walk us through where you are in terms of unlocking some of that value and how much of it is -- why you're not working through some more of what's on the balance sheet at this point? Certainly, it would suggest that, perhaps, it's not a margin accretive move at this point. And give us thoughts around how much is \"mothballed\" and when do you expect to unlock that value? Because certainly, community count growth down 10% to 15% is kind of atypical in terms of the peer group right now.","Richard J. Dugas","Mike, this is Richard. I'll start and then turn it to Bob for a little more comment on mothballed. I would suggest we are unlocking a large amount of opportunity in our existing business. I mean, our sign-up growth last year was predicated almost exclusively on existing store -- existing stores improving better, which was our thesis coming in all along. We tend to have a much longer lived community portfolio than many of our peers do. So it stands to reason we have room to run within those existing communities, kind of like Ivy's question on Del Webb, where we still have a lot of runway out in front of us given the number of lots we have on the ground. And we don't need to invest in that business specifically. We feel we're executing our strategy exactly as outlined for the past couple of years. We're focused on improving returns. And as long as we can continue to drive acceptable paces in our existing communities, we feel like it's the right move. Having said that, we're comfortable in implementing this additional investment now that we've outlined, but we're going to do so smartly. We are not going to chase unit volume, and I would suggest the quality of the earnings that we want to deliver going forward is going to be focused primarily from margin growth, SG&A leverage and some growth from exist -- or from additional assets over time as we bring them online. But that's our focus, and ROIC is the name of the game. We think we're doing a good job there. In terms of how much is left for mothballed, Bob, you might want to answer that.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. We've never really answered that question. We have helped people to find mothballed in some of our longer-phase Webb development make it a little confusing. The only thing I'd add to what Richard said is, we opened 15 communities that were truly mothballed in fiscal '12. We think we'll open another 10 in fiscal '13. There aren't that many more that we see that would be obvious to open today.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, I appreciate that. And I guess, the second question on the margins. I guess, going back to the comment of 17% of closings from the value engineering, should costing, common plan management, I think it'll be helpful to understand what type of margin differential those closings currently generate versus the corporate average to get a sense of, as this increases, what the upside from these initiatives are. And if I could just sneak in another one, any thoughts around moving the commissions out of COGS into SG&A? I think, something like 3\/4 of your competitors do it that way. I think it might be helpful from an apples-to-apples. So sorry to sneak 2 in there, but if you could.","Richard J. Dugas","Mike, I'll handle the first one. All I'll say regarding the common plan management work is that, we do have better margins coming from those efforts than businesses that are -- excuse me, plans that are not commonly plan managed. So I'm not going to give a lot of specific detail, but we'd like the upside that, that ramping volume will give us as a percentage in terms of our margin. Bob, you want to handle the commission question?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. We're comfortable with our presentation. We can think about it certainly Mike.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Your guidance of $260 million, I believe, in the interest, that's, obviously, going to -- on a higher sales revenue volume, result in some margin benefit, probably, in the order of 100 basis points. What other -- for the gross margin, excluding that, what would be some of the other puts and takes that you're thinking? What's your fixed cost in gross margin that you're going to get volume leveraged? And how do you think about the price? Because, obviously, the labor and material inflation, given that your land cost has been largely fixed and not inflating?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Ken, it's Bob. I just want to be clear that, that incremental interest expense will be a detriment to reported gross margins. Right.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","On a dollar basis.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Correct.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. But on a percentage with higher revenue, it's going to be...","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, again, that's not a volume-based comment from us. It's just that it's where our expectation for -- based on our expectation of turns, our interest expense will be. And to your second point, the margin impact that we see of substance is commodity, we've planned in our 2013 and it's reflected in our view of margin, about a $2,000 to $2,500 increase in house cost. So maybe, call it, 1.5% or 1.6% of our actual house costs which may be 80 basis points of margins.","Michael J. Schweninger","And just to add on to that. I mean, your question on fixed versus variable. For our composition of our margins, everything's variable. We don't have -- some people may have certain overheads that run through their margins for the [indiscernible], we do not.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then given your comments on community count and the trend down there, can you give us a feel for, at least, in the fifth -- fourth quarter to understand, the fixed versus variable mix in SG&A, which would give us the fixed G&A piece? And with the community counts going where they are, do you expect lower fixed G&A in 2013 on a dollar basis?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","I apologize. There was a lot in there. The majority -- I think to Mike's point, our SG&A is largely dependent on our cost base; not on commission, because that's up in cost of goods sold. So I apologize, Ken, I don't understand the question.","Michael J. Schweninger","And, Ken, maybe, just as we've mentioned in previous calls, from an SG&A perspective, it's all somewhat variable, but we keep it fixed, given where we expect the business to be. But to Bob's point, commissions don't impact in the like. So depending upon where we see the business going, we adjust our overhead structure accordingly, because most of it is kind of people and other type cost.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","And just to follow that, we went through a fairly lengthy and painful, in some ways, restructuring of the business, last piece of that, 18 months or so ago. We feel very comfortable with the structure that's in place today. And what we said is that doesn't flex dramatically based on whether volume ramps up, and 2012 was a good example of that. So we got leverage with the increased volume, and so we think, certainly, if you have lower community count, you may have a one less salesperson, one less construction manager, but don't think it moves the needle very much on our SG&A spend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question was about the comments on private builders and privates getting more active in the land market, and I thought that was very interesting. Most of your peers are probably saying that, although the privates want to be there, they're not getting financing. So I'm wondering if you kind of heard about how privates are getting financing and probably getting more aggressive in the land market, given that the ADC lending is still relatively tight for most privates at this point.","Richard J. Dugas","David, this is Richard. There's been a lot couple of larger privates that have been notably quite active in the land market overall. So I don't really have a lot of detail and color on where they're getting financing, but there's no question land market has gotten heated of late. And our comments are just to help everybody understand. We don't want to chase volume, we want to chase good returns. And we're very comfortable with a prudent, what we believe is intelligent investment strategy going forward. Our thinking all along was we needed to repair our balance sheet, and now that we feel like we can generate really good returns, we're comfortable putting more into the business. But we're just trying to reference the fact that, that in some markets, it's a real challenge to get land deals to pencil and we want to be careful.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that makes sense. Just a quick follow up, can you help us kind of frame the additional $250 million, what that would do in terms of either the potential for growth or community count? I mean, I know it's difficult to average or generalize, but just give us an idea, if you're able to put the $250 million to work, what kind of growth that would support or community count growth that would support?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, David, the only thing we'll say, and Bob gave the community count guidance for '13, it's not going to impact '13 in a community count way. But we do believe that'll impact '14, start moving the needle back up then. We'll have more to say about that as we get through the year. But we've got to see how much of this capital we can actually put the work, what changes we may have to that capital assumption over the year as the market unfolds. It's an evergreen process within the company. And it's actually a very good process that -- thanks to some help that Bob has given us, and the way we think about this over the last 18 months, we reevaluated every single quarter. So I could just tell you that directionally, that incremental capital is not getting any impact on 2013 community count in a positive direction, but we do believe it'll start moving the needle in '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Richard, you talked a bit about not chasing volume, talked about focusing on quality, earnings and returns. I was wondering what that says about the longer term thoughts on, maybe, 2014 or '15 when in a normal environment, your thoughts on what that means for cash flow and how you'll balance future cash flow and how that relates to returning to cash to shareholders, how that differs from what Pulte was 10 years ago.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Adam, it's a great question. And actually, we have some continued work to do to think about that over time. And I think it's fair to say that we were definitely super bullish on land for a long time. We saw some pain, some significant pain as a result of that. And we want to be more balanced going forward. Our goal is to generate long-term returns on invested capital, because we think over the long run, that's going to benefit our shareholders the best. So what I would tell you is that in the past, it may have been heavy-weighting toward land. I think you've seen us take some aggressive moves with debt. We think we're investing in land appropriately, but the other uses of cash, including dividend and potential buybacks are on the table. And we'll have more to say about that as we make decisions. So nothing firm right now, but over time, we're likely to be, I would suggest, more balanced in our overall approach than perhaps we have been in the past.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I just want to follow up on one of the other questions that I wasn't -- maybe I missed or wasn't clear to me. But you said -- the interest, the higher interest amortized next year or this year, on a GAAP basis, are you expecting that to have a negative impact on your reported GAAP gross margin or are you just talking about dollar amounts?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, it is -- you've got an increase of reported interest expense that will flow through our gross margin, so it'll be deleterious to income compared to year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can just talk about the land and the community count really impacting '14 and not '13. I guess, you also talked then about the intentionally slowing sales in some of the markets. So if we're thinking about that, and presumably, the impact in committee count is probably worst as we go through the first half of this year in terms of year-over-year basis, is that correct? And should we be thinking about orders that way in terms of more of a focus on margin, but essentially, hurting the orders here during -- more during the first half than the second?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Dan, we're not going to provide any commentary on orders. Our community count is going to be down this year, as we mentioned. But we're not going to give a lot of guidance on exactly how it's down through the year. I will just go back to, though, some of the things that Bob mentioned when he was talking about community count. Everybody's very focused on it in the outside world. But given our community count composition and things like same-store sales in existing communities, things like the overall balanced approach that we feel that we have to running the business, the Del Webb component, a lot of things impact volume. So again, we're not providing volume guidance, and I'm not going to provide any more specifics on community count, but I guess, I would leave it in that. It's not only about community count in terms of your volume.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about the Centex orders being up 2%. And I guess wondering in terms of just land investment, you talked about more in terms of the higher-end, but how is land investment focused in terms of the sort of Pulte, Del Webb and Centex?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, we've seen the vast majority of our land investment recently going to the Pulte brand, with not as much into Centex or Del Webb. We have 1 or 2 Del Webb communities that we're going to be opening this year and some Centex communities as well. But the lion share of the investment has gone into Pulte, because that's where we're seeing the best returns right now. We are excited about the Centex brand over the long run. We have new product that's focused there, that's driving some, we believe, higher margins in that category and better profitability for us in that category, which will help the land transactions pencil more easily in the future. But to date, most of the investment's gone into Pulte.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question on the balance sheet. Your $1 billion tender brought in about 1\/2 that amount in this last quarter. And even with that, just coming in, in 1\/2, your debt-to-capital dropping to 32% is pretty impressive now. Looking forward, I mean, you said you're going to -- you don't want to chase volume for volume's sake, but you are increasing the amount of capital spend. So at what stage, I mean, what -- how are you looking at leverage going forward, normalized -- a lot of people would consider to be a 40% to 45%, some builders might even run a little bit hotter than that in a recovery. So how far do you want that to go down? And how are you thinking about that going forward?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Nishu, again, it's Bob. Interestingly, the tender we offered for $1 billion, we actually got $222 million. We then called our '13 paper, which was another $170 million. And then we had open market repurchases, which were targeted in the $14s to $15s of $104 million. So looking at the maturity profile now, we have nothing to do in '13. And then the maturities stack, when we get out to '14 is just about $400 million. And in terms of your question on how we view the investment, I think Richard covered that. We are looking at the ways to utilize the cash balance at we have. We've talked about wanting to be at 40% debt-to-cap. That would be a gross number, not net. So we've got to some room to improve there. Again, the economics don't make a lot of sense to us to go out and buy our debt today because it is very richly priced, particularly, as you get into those outer maturity years. So again, we think we accomplished a great deal this year. We're proud of the fact that net debt-to-cap is in the 30s. We think we've got some room to run there. Obviously, we increased the investments that we're making in land, $250 million this year shows that we're positive on the market and willing to put our money to work, obviously, the overall goal to increase our returns.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And the second question on the charge in the Financial Services division. The $49 million, I believe, it was. The extra year of repurchase request you're assuming here and the delta that you increased in '12, being higher than you'd originally forecast, what time period does that relate to? And what sorts of originations does that relate to?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","It really has little to no change from what we've reported in the past. Again 6 and 7 originations, by far, the majority of what we're seeing, severity on these hasn't changed materially. So it's really just -- we got more of them in 2012. Now it's interesting, you can see from the chart that the volume went down in the fourth quarter after having spiked in the third quarter. And what I would suggest is the same thing we said then, 2 or 3 months doesn't make a trend at that really elevated level that we saw in the third quarter. We're not sure that what we saw in the fourth quarter is completely consistent with what we're going to see going forward. So we -- when we -- yes, there's lots of estimates. There's lots of process that goes into the estimates for the reserve. But as we look at it over the balance of 2012, the heightened level resulted in a higher cost to us and then adding 1 year, obviously, drives the big change in the reserve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citi Group.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of your active lots, maybe that's a different way of looking at it, or total lots, could you give a breakdown between Del Webb, Pulte and legacy Centex?","Michael J. Schweninger","Yes. I can do that. From a -- about 38% of our controlled lots are Pulte; 23% is Centex; and 39% are Del Webb.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And do you have that -- is that on an active basis or total basis?","Michael J. Schweninger","Well, it's -- we don't explain -- we don't list out active versus unactive, so those will be in our total controlled lot.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I really appreciate the studies you guys put out on housing demographics. I guess, Richard, how do you think about the echo boomers in the context of basically the sub 35-year-olds today are underemployed, hopefully not chronically, due to baby boomers not leaving the workforce or retiring. How do you think about that from a big picture perspective? And how do you think that'll hit your business?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I think we're going to need to be very value focused in order to capture demand in that environment. And I do believe that mortgage availability for that category is something that we need to pay attention to. Hopefully, underwriting over time, will ease a little bit from pretty severe restrictions today in order to allow us to capture that business. But listen, we are focused on investment today where we think we have the best opportunity, which is primarily in the move-up category and in the active-adult category for a lot of the reasons that you're kind of alluding to there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So basically, a couple of housekeeping questions, first. I guess, can you give us a sense for what your sticks-and-bricks level is looking like in dollars right now and the number of finished lots that you own?","Michael J. Schweninger","Sure. I can give you that. Our house inventory balance is $580 million at 12\/31. Our finished lots owned is 27,828, of which 6,537 relate to house. And just in addition to that, we control an additional 5,732 finished lots to be optioned.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And I guess, just the last question regarding your margins going forward. Can you give us a sense for your expectation of your ability to control specifically, your hard costs, not addressing the labor here. But obviously, we're starting to see some significant price increases coming through from the part of the manufacturer. And I was curious as to if you could share, in your view, something  -- or not even in your view -- some things that you've actually -- some success stories perhaps, in terms of your ability to be able to keep those costs down on a relative basis to your competitors, particularly your smaller peers. Do you any data supporting that, that is actually happening?","Richard J. Dugas","Steve, a couple of things from Richard. And Bob, feel free to add anything. A couple of things. We added, as Bob indicated, some money in our forecasting processes this year, assuming pressure from both materials and labor. So that was kind of factored into our assumptions overall. Despite that, we're confident in our ability to grow margins through the structural efforts that we have underway, including pricing that we see on the market, our value engineering work, et cetera. So yes, while we are seeing the pressure that everyone else is seeing overall, we still are eclipsing that in our mind with the overall market environment, allowing us to take margins higher overall. I don't have any great data for you relative to the smaller peers. I don't know, Bob, do you have anything else there you want to add?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. Stephen, I think the simple answer is as a big buyer of service and commodity, we believe we absolutely have price competitive advantage over, to your question, smaller peers. We buy things in bulk. We have a team of people who are focused on national purchase contracts and\/or significant contracted market. And so we think we have preferred provider status with many of our suppliers. It would range anywhere from how we purchase appliances, to how we purchase lumber, paint. Again, so relative to a  small private builder, we think we have a competitive advantage.","Richard J. Dugas","Stephen, I might just add one other item. I think as big an advantage in pricing as Bob alluded to, is the ability to get our homes built. As one of the bigger builders in the country, and I know a couple of our peers have talked about this. It's tough out there, particularly to find labor, and we can command more folks on our job sites than smaller guys. So I think as big an advantage we may have in dollar and cents, we have in terms of being able to meet production quotas over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Barron from Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I guess I just kind of want to get your thoughts on the longer-term view of Centex. I mean, I know you said you got some stuff coming up, but we've seen kind of a community count going down. When do you guys think that's going to turn around?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. It's very tough to forecast that overall. Centex, unlike, say, Del Webb, has a lot smaller communities, typically, for us overall. And listen, the best thing we can tell you there is we like the buyer category. We're very committed to the buyer category. We are continuing to invest in that category, not at the same rate, but that we're going to put our money where we can get the best returns. And if we're not seeing as good of returns in that category today for a variety of reasons, we're not going to just push investment into that category just to push investment there. So we're very comfortable with our approach. I can't answer the question in terms of when community count will start improving for Centex overall, but let's leave it with the fact that we want to continue investing in that category, but doing so to generate the best returns for our shareholders.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay. And so how would you foresee, I guess, the percentage of the mix that Centex will play, maybe a couple of years down the road? And also just kind of a separate question, are you guys starting to see or what percentage of your buyers would you say your are people coming out of foreclosure rentals and starting to buy again?","Richard J. Dugas","Alex, with regard to the percentage, it's extremely hard to estimate out a couple of years. I wouldn't hesitate to want to guess that. I will say, on your second part of your question, we are starting to see people who have gone through the foreclosure process enter back. Anecdotally, over the past 6 months or so, I've heard more and more of that as people work through their 3-year period and reestablish credit to be able to buy. I think that's a good sign. It's an indication that people want to buy housing. And look, they're being squeezed really hard with rental rate increases. We've talked about that repeatedly. So that is a source of business for us in the future, and we're continuing to be focused there.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Zeumer for closing remarks.","James P. Zeumer","Jody, thank you. I want to thank everybody for their time this morning.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Great. Thank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone participating this morning's conference call to discuss PulteGroup's third quarter financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President, and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's discussion are posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to the site later on.","Let me remind all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by any comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup's third quarter financial results reflect another quarter of strong business performance across key operating metrics, partially offset by the challenging production environment that is impacting us in many housing markets across the country.","More specifically, I would highlight our strong sales performance and the increase in absolute signups and absorption paces, both of which moved higher in the quarter. I believe these results attest to the sustained rebound in overall U.S. housing demand and are consistent with our expectations that the recovery path for this housing cycle will be gradual and prolonged.","Beyond signups, I would also highlight that our gross margins of 23.6% are up 70 basis points over last year, and up 30 basis points from the second quarter 2015. Pulte's gross margins continue to be among the highest in the whole building industry, which demonstrates the tremendous progress we have made from when we began this journey less than five years ago. I believe that our gains in third quarter signups, absorption paces, and gross margins have all benefited from the quality of the land positions we have been putting under contract over the past few years.","As we have talked about on prior calls, we have worked hard to maintain a disciplined approach toward acquiring better located land positions that we believe will generate higher risk adjusted returns. In addition to supporting the idea of better land locations, the strength of our gross margins demonstrates continued success in the implementing our strategic pricing initiatives, and in expanding the use of commonly managed plans.","In the third quarter, commonly managed plans accounted for almost 60% of closings, which is up from 45% last year, and keeps us on track to reach our goal of 70% in 2016. Our margins are also benefiting from prior actions to significantly reduce our debt balances, which, in turn, has helped to lower our annual interest expense. Through the first nine months of 2015, interest expense running through the cost of sales is down almost $37 million from last year. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including reducing our overall balance sheet leverage these past few years, is clearly having an impact.","And finally, I look at our contract backlog, approaching 9,000 homes with a total value of $3.1 billion, up 18% over last year, and note that these are our highest Q3 backlog statistics since 2007. Given the strength of our backlog and a roughly $100 million year-over-year increase in homes under production on the balance sheet, I am encouraged by how well we are positioned for the remainder of the year and heading into 2016.","These same backlog stats, however, reflect the struggles that we, and as reported, the broader industry, continue to face getting homes delivered on a consistent schedule, due primarily to constraints across the production system.","We talked on prior calls about working to overcome construction bottlenecks that had developed, but these delays are taking longer than expected to correct. The reality is that resource constraints, particularly as it relates to labor, exist across a number of our markets, and are continuing to hinder our progress.","With almost 8,000 homes under construction, which is up 1,000 units over this time last year, the houses are clearly in the production pipeline and will ultimately be delivered. We would anticipate that we'll close some of the gap with prior-year production metrics in the fourth quarter, and then work to make additional progress in 2016.","The good news is that overall demand for housing continues to be positive. Overall, I see a lot to be proud of within our third quarter results and what they say about our commitment to running this business to deliver earnings growth with higher returns over time.","Consistent with our long-term objectives with regard to delivering higher returns, we continue to allocate capital in alignment with our stated priorities: first, to invest in the business, which we did in the form of $586 million of land and development spend in the third quarter; second, to fund an increase in dividend; third, to consider opportunistic M&A; and fourth, to return excess funds to shareholders via share repurchases, which we did in the third quarter to the level of $121 million.","Our land investment for the quarter keeps us on track with prior guidance of allocating roughly $2.3 billion to land acquisition and development in 2015. We expect this level of investment to be supportive of future volume and, more importantly, earnings growth for the company. This investment level is also consistent with our expectation that U.S. housing demand continues to move higher over the next few years, as an improving economy generates new jobs and ultimately higher wages, and help sustain the recent gains in household formation numbers the country has been experiencing. Against this positive demand environment, we see generally favorable supply dynamics with reasonable inventories of existing homes and a manageable supply of new homes available for sale.","If you wanted to find a silver lining in a cloud of tight land and labor resources, it would be that the supply of new homes is not as likely to get ahead of consumer demand as in past cycles. Overall, our expectations remain positive with regard to the broader economy and related macro-housing conditions across the U.S.","We see a lot of runway out in front of the new home industry, with particularly bright prospects for PulteGroup, given our strong sales and margin performance, driven, in part, by our disciplined land investments.","Now, let me turn over the call to Bob for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. As Richard indicated, there are a lot of positives to be taken from PulteGroup's business results, and how the quarter positions the company for improved performance going forward.","Looking at the specifics for the quarter, homebuilding revenue totaled $1.5 billion, which is down 6% from the prior-year. The change in homebuilding revenues was driven by a 6% decline in closings, to 4,356 homes, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in average selling price, to $336,000.","Per Richard's comments, home deliveries in Q3 were below our expectations. As we discussed on our most recent call, we expected that our conversion rate would trend toward more recent norms over the back half of this year. Resource constraints, however, particularly related to labor and land development delays triggered by tough weather conditions at the start of the year, hindered our efforts.","We remain confident that we will work through this, and with a healthy backlog of sold homes, this is fundamentally a timing issue. We continue to expect to make up some ground in Q4 relative to historical closing metrics, and then we'll work to realize further gains as we get into 2016.","In the third quarter, closings by brand were as follows: 23% in Centex communities; 49% in Pulte; and 28% in Del Webb. This compares with closings of 24%, 46%, and 30%, respectively, in the third quarter of last year.","On our last call, we talked about targeted consumer groups, or TCGs, being a more granular approach to defining the buyers we serve. Breaking the business down by TCGs shows that 33% of our third quarter closings were first-time buyers, 35% were move-up buyers, and 32% were active adult buyers.","As we've discussed on our last call, one of the primary differences between discussing brands versus TCGs is among first-time buyers. We continue to invest in developing infill communities under the Pulte Homes name, designed to serve first-time buyers, typically older millennials, who want to live closer-in and can afford to pay the higher prices such locations can typically command.","For the quarter, the company reported gross margins of 23.6%, which represents a year-over-year increase of 70 basis points, and sequential increase of 30 basis points from Q2 of this year. Based on our current backlog, we anticipate Q4 gross margins to be consistent with the third quarter of this year. Q3 margins continued to benefit from increased option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues increased 7%, or $3,300 per closing, and lot premiums increased 6%, or $674 per closing, compared with last year.","Sales discounts in the quarter totaled just 2% per home, which is up roughly 30 basis points from last year, but still remains relatively modest at only $6,900 per closing. As our numbers indicate, our focus on driving greater profitability through our strategic pricing programs continues to yield benefits.","Reported Q3 SG&A of $159 million, or 10.9% of home sale revenues, includes the benefit of approximately $6 million, resulting from a recent legal settlement realized by the company. I think it's important to also highlight the litigation-related charge we recorded in the quarter.","PulteGroup received an unfavorable jury verdict in the amount of $20 million associated with a contract dispute. We have already filed post-trial motions seeking to, among other things, overturn the jury verdict, and are prepared to appeal the decision, should that action be required. However, in light of the decision, we recorded a reserve in the full amount of the jury award. The charges reflected on our income statement and other expense net.","Our financial services segment reported pre-tax income of $14 million in the quarter, which is up from 11% in the comparable prior-year period. Our mortgage capture rate in Q3 increased to 83%, up from 80% in last year's third quarter.","For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 40%, which is up slightly from last year and from our guidance. The higher rate was driven primarily by adjustments to our deferred tax assets, resulting from changes in certain state tax rates.","Net income for the third quarter was $108 million, or $0.30 per share. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 353 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities.","Looking at our homebuilding operations, we ended the third quarter with 7,849 homes under construction, of which 17% were spec. Consistent with comments we made on our last earnings call, we're putting additional spec units into production with the goal of helping to even out quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in future construction cadence. Even with this increase, we ended Q3 with only 343 finished spec homes.","Looking at our land position, we approved approximately 6,000 lots for purchase during the quarter, and ended the period with 137,000 lots under control. Approximately 41,000 of these lots, or 30% of our land position, are controlled via option.","Continuing a trend you have seen over the past few years, we continue to strategically increase our use of land options as a way to enhance returns on our invested capital and to lower our overall risk profile. Of our controlled lots, approximately 24% are finished, and 17% are currently under development.","While our land spend has been increasing, we continue to invest under a disciplined process that is focused on identifying well-located parcels that can generate higher risk adjusted returns. In addition to keeping our preference for closer-in locations, we are also seeking to manage the duration of our projects.","In the quarter, we spent $586 million on land acquisition and development. Of this spend, 56% was for development of previously acquired land, and 44% was for the acquisition of new positions. This brings our total land investment for the first nine months of 2015 to $1.5 billion, and keeps us on track to invest the $2.3 billion previously announced.","Excluding the handful of Del Webb positions we've added this year, the average lot count in our newly approved communities is roughly 100 homes. While generally keeping the duration of our projects shorter, means a lot of work for our operations teams, it helps to reduce the risks associated with any single land position.","In addition to risk mitigation, another benefit of a disciplined land investment process is the better margins that well positioned land parcels can support. As Richard said, PulteGroup's strong margins are partly the result of our defined investment practices. Along with investing in the business, we returned $121 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 5.9 million common shares at an average price of $20.29 per share.","In the third quarter, we executed a $500 million term loan agreement. The proceeds from this transaction are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Inclusive of these funds, the company ended the quarter with $760 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 31%.","On a year-over-year basis, signups in the third quarter were up 8%, to 4,092 homes. This reflects a 6% increase in our absorption paces over last year. On a dollar basis, signups increased 17%, to $1.5 billion as the average sales price in our backlog rose 7%, to $354,000.","For the third quarter, the company operated out of 611 communities. This is up 2% from last year, and within the range of 610 to 625 communities we provided on our Q2 earnings call. As Richard highlighted, we ended the quarter with a backlog of 8,734 homes, with a value of $3.1 billion, which is up 18% over last year.","Now, let me turn the call back to Richard.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob. Before opening the call to questions, let me provide some brief comments on the market conditions we experienced in third quarter.","As you would anticipate given our increased signups and absorption paces, demand in the third quarter continued the positive trends we saw in the first half of 2015. On average, traffic to our communities was up over last year, and we continue to see opportunities to selectively push pricing through our strategic pricing programs.","At a market level, we have not seen material shifts in demand conditions over the past several quarters. Broadly speaking, we continue to see better performance from communities that are closer-in and well located.","More specific to the geographies, demand conditions in the third quarter were as follows: We continue to see good demand trends along the entire East Coast, but particularly as you look to the Southeast. Consistent with our comments we have made on many of our recent earnings calls, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida remain areas of strong demand.","In the middle third of the country, demand conditions were generally positive, although we did note some meaningful volatility in the performance of individual markets. Looking specifically at Texas, total signups for the state were down about 5%, as the strength in Dallas' Q3 orders effectively offset softness in Houston and San Antonio.","Land development and related community opening delays, caused by tough weather earlier in the year, certainly had an impact on sales for the quarter, and we are continuing to see some oil-related weakness in Houston, most notably at the higher selling prices.","And finally, out West, we continue to experience robust demand across the major markets in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.","Let me close out our prepared remarks with a final thought. U.S. housing demand has been improving over the past few years, and we would say that it has been good in 2015. The reality is, however, that at a pace of 500,000, plus or minus, annual new home sales, the market is still 30% or more away from being just average.","Assuming the economy continues to chug along, even at what most consider only a modest pace of growth, we expect new home sales can continue to grind higher in the coming years. As we have been saying since the housing recovery began, we expect the slope of the recovery will continue to be gradual, and there may be a pause or two along the way, but we believe there is more upside opportunity over the coming years.","We see PulteGroup as being extremely well-positioned to be successful within this type of environment. We are putting incremental capital to work in the business, which we expect will support future growth. We continue to focus on construction and overhead efficiency to leverage that growth into greater earnings potential, and we are further enhancing that earnings potential by reducing outstanding shares and returning excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and routine share buybacks. We believe that this approach of running a balanced business through the cycle, versus trying to time the market, will benefit our shareholders over the long run.","And, finally, let me close by thanking the employees of PulteGroup, who do an amazing job operating our business every day and who work passionately to deliver a great home buying experience to our customers.","Let me now turn over the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Great. Thank you, Richard. We will now open the call for questions. So, that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up.","Carol, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My question \u2013 I'd like to follow-up a bit on the construction bottlenecks comment you made earlier, appeared to be impacting your conversion rates. If I'm understanding this correctly, it sounds like an issue with, I guess, obtaining and retaining labor? If that's the case, what can you do or what are you willing to do to remediate the issue, or are you comfortable with the lower conversion? And, I guess, are you offering incentives to buyers in your backlog like we've heard some of your peers doing? Would you be willing to offer incentives to people experiencing delays in home deliveries?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Haendel this is Richard. There's quite a few questions there. In general, labor is the primary culprit of our lower conversion. No, we're not happy about it, overall, it's clearly impacting our production. In general, we're having to pay more for labor, and we're beginning to work hard to try to source additional trades, either taking trades from some markets that have capacity to other markets, or look for additional trades in markets beyond the ones that we've been using.","Having said that, it's going to be a slower process to correct than we had anticipated, which is one of the reasons why our conversion was weak this quarter. Having said that, we are not offering incentives to buyers to extend their closing. We're doing our best to estimate proper closing times when they sign contracts, so we have not had issues in that regard.","And then finally, we are beginning to start a little bit more spec inventory at this time of year in order for additional deliveries to be available for us in the early part and middle part of 2016, in order to help even our production flow out, so we're not quite as spiked toward Q3 and Q4 like we have been. That's going to take some time to implement, but that's as many broad pieces of the issue as I can get to.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Richard, maybe just talk a little bit more on the orders. You gave a nice roundup on what's happening geographically. Your absorption has moved up, your ASP moved up a bit. What's your strategy right now? You're also putting more specs on the ground. At this point, given your land spend, are you trying to drive absorptions much more quickly than you have in the past, or are you trying to ramp your margin as much as you can? I know that's been your strategy in the past, but just trying to understand if there has been any change here on your strategy?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Steve, there has been absolutely no change to be clear. Our absorption strength, we believe, is driven by good land locations and sticking to our discipline of driving as much price as we can, particularly in a constrained environment, where we're having difficulty getting homes delivered.","With regard to increased spec, I want to be crystal clear. It's a modest increase in spec, and it's, frankly, timed when the spec inventory would be available during the strength of the selling season, which we would say would start, call it, late January through May or June. It's not sort of a broad brush change in strategy.","But with only 17 of our homes in production being spec, we have cut it pretty far back, and we think there's an opportunity to potentially modestly even the flow of deliveries in the future, which will help reduce the dependence on this kind of maddening Q3 and Q4 spike at the end of the year.","But no change in terms of policies with regard to discounting and\/or driving absorptions over price. It's still a focus on return. We obviously balance both, but I will say, as evidenced by Bob's comments, this is the umpteenth quarter in a row that option \u2013 margin \u2013 excuse me \u2013 option dollar contributions and lot premiums are up, and that's not by accident.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. One thing I forgot to mention, before I go on to my next question. The West, you've categorized is robust, we've heard some rumblings recently that the West has slowed. One, I was wanting to know, if you're seeing anything on that? And then, as you look at your land spend, any difference in brand allocation, where you're going with it moving forward, or your regions? And what's land market look like as far as re-trading with costs moving up? Have you started to see more re-trading in the market?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll start and then throw it to Bob for a little more color. With regard to the West, specifically, Stephen, Arizona is doing quite well. Our Northern California business continues to do well. We don't have as much investment as some in Southern Cal, but we are doing well with the good locations there. And then we have a pretty small business in Pac-Northwest that we're trying to ramp up, so it's not as relevant to our total; but in general, we're pleased with what we see.","With regard to land spend, we're continuing to allocate most of the dollars to the Pulte brand and selective Del Webb positions as we rotate out of others, with a little bit less in the Centex brand, but as Bob highlighted, we're beginning to put more money into the first-time category that served through the Pulte brand for this urban millennial category in many markets, which we have really good demand characteristics from. With regard to land pricing and any re-trading, I've not heard of much, but Bob, any more color on land pricing?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. As we've talked about, we're typically staying closer into the core. We haven't seen a significant pullback there. It's still competitive for just about every position we look at, and we're not seeing a lot of returning.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my call.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning. First question, just touching back on labor for a minute, if we can. It's been widely talked about that there's been labor constraints in the market, but our feeling was that it was kind of isolated to markets like Colorado and Texas. Are you seeing more of a widespread impact at this point?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","John, this is Richard. The Journal had an article a couple of weeks ago that referenced this. It is definitely widespread. There's no question about it. There's not a market in the country that we're not experiencing some degree of labor shortage pressure. So, yes, it's definitely more than just Texas and Colorado.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And it may be a different trade base, depending upon the geography that you're dealing with. It may be framers in one area, it may be masons in another, but you can find it across most of our major markets.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks. And then, moving on, there has been some bank data that has come out, and some of the retailers have even talked about the environment in Texas just starting to soften even more than some had expected. You guys are just still seeing it kind of at the higher end, is that correct?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The higher end in Houston, to be more specific. I think, as we indicated, Dallas had a good quarter. Houston and San Antonio effectively offset that to give us that negative 5% comp; so, candidly, it doesn't feel a lot different than it has for most of the year with some oil related softening at the higher end, and Houston being the primary driver of Texas weakness.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Alan.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","So, I know the focus this morning is obviously on the construction delays, but I was actually hoping to ask a question on another topic, which I think is a big focal point of Pulte investors, which is the growth potential over the next few years.","And as we look here at your forward-looking growth indicators here, your land spend is going to be up about 30% this year. Your lot count is up double-digits over the last couple years. Your SG&A dollars are up about 10% year-over-year, which usually come in advance of community count growth. And I know you've been reluctant to talk about community count guidance in the past, but when I look at all those metrics, it points to inflection point that should be coming soon.","And what I was really hoping you could give is a little bit of a blueprint on where you see the business growing over the next several years? Are we wrong to extrapolate those numbers and think that growth should eventually break out of this low single-digit range that you've been in, on the community count side for the last couple of years? And any timing and magnitude of that, I think, would be helpful, just in framing expectations out there?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Alan, this is Richard. First of all, we will be giving community count guidance on the Q4 call, as we traditionally do. It gives us a little better window as we get to our planning season right now, as we put our business plan together for 2016.","Having said that, we certainly expect growth in the future years. The investment ramp-up that you're seeing is definitely having an impact. I will point out that we specifically, in our script, emphasized our future earnings potential, and we also talked about volume potential, but we're really focused on driving earnings and return, over time.","So, my point is that dollars spent, depending on where they are spent, don't create lots equally. And, frankly, as an example, for investing in the Southeast or Texas, we're getting quite a few more lots than if we're in Northern California, and we had been reasonably balanced with our overall investment. So, that's why community count to us is only partially the indicator, and why we're emphasizing absorption rates for community.","Having said all that, Alan, we do expect growth in the out-years, from here. I'm not in a position to tell you how much that is, but we haven't been ramping up our investment spend to stay flat.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in a second one. I was hoping you could just give us your construction cycle timelines, where they're running today versus a year ago, and any margin impact that you expect these delays to have going forward as you look out over the next few quarters?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, our cycle time is roughly, and this is rough. I'm not going to give granular detail. About 10% higher, in terms of overall construction cycle times, versus, say, a year ago. Indicative of the labor shortages that we're seeing. I'm sorry, Alan. What was the second piece of that?","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Just any potential impact on margin as a result of these delays on deliveries?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't think there is much of a margin impact based on delays. We have not heard, I've been talking to our operators frequently, of incentives or any offerings to consumers. I think we're doing a good job of setting expectations when we sign a contract that, as an example, instead of a home being delivered five months out, it may be seven months or eight months out based on where we slot in the production cycle. So, that, in and of itself, I don't think has much impact on margin. Now, again, we're not providing forward margin guidance beyond what Bob's prepared remarks said about Q4, which we expect to be approximately where we are in Q3.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Alan, the only thing I'd add to that is, and it goes to the question of labor rates and pricing. We have seen, obviously, some pressure on that. So, the 1.5%-ish increase in house costs that we've said is probably likely a little bit higher this year, as a result of that. Offsetting that is a relatively benign commodity market. So, you can see it in our margins this quarter sequentially, being up 30 basis points. Now, there's interest benefit in that, but the homebuilding margin has stayed flat, and it's our expectation that, based on the backlog, we see that through the end of the year. So, it doesn't necessarily translate to margin compression, just because we've got time extension.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. Thanks and good luck.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Mike.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question on \u2013 just going back to the gross margins for a moment. A little bit better, I think, than we were looking for, perhaps than what you were implying in your guidance last quarter. And I just wanted to get a sense of, number one, to the extent that's true, it was maybe a little bit better, what was driving that?","And as you look into 2016, I know you don't want to give guidance at this point, but, just strategically, you've talked in the past about not going too far down the rabbit hole, chasing the entry-level buyer, given that you feel that the absorption isn't there yet, to justify the lower gross margins. If that's something that as you kind of balance margin versus, perhaps, incremental segment in that area, is there a balance? Are you willing to kind of increase that by a little bit? I know the Centex piece, which you consider more entry-level, is more focused on that segment and seems to continue to shrink. Just how to think about that segment's influence on gross margins going forward?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, this is Richard. I have a couple thoughts in that regard. First of all, we're not going to give specific margin targets for next year. I would suspect that most of our margin performance will be driven by whatever costs are coming through the pipeline with regard to land and house. And, obviously, offset by whatever the revenue side is from a selling environment. The reason I point that out, is we do not intend to kind of change our strategy with regard to our focus.","You pointed out the declining focus on entry-level. I'll just point out that the first-time buyer, as reflected in some of these urban projects, we are ramping up some investment in overall. But it's really going to be largely dependent on what happens when we get into the spring selling season, in terms of what kind of margins we deliver next year, along with the land costs coming through.","And just lastly, I will tell you that our Centex margins continue to be strong, even though we're driving a combination of pace and price there. So, again, I apologize for not providing details for you in terms of guidance going forward. I think the most relevant thing you can take away is, we're not intending to change our strategy.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just so I'm clear on that question. Was the gross margins maybe a little bit better than expected in 3Q \u2013 and then my second question is \u2013 and if that's so, what was driving that?","And my second question is, the interest expense amortization continues to come down. Directionally, should we expect that to continue in 2016 as a percent of sales and on an absolute basis? Any thoughts there would be helpful.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, on Q3 margins, obviously mix matters, Mike. The margins were in line with what we expected. The relative mix of it moved it a little bit. But, we don't have complete vision of what our margins are going to be. So, when we said 23.3%-ish (34:23) that is reflective of what we saw actually in the third quarter.","On interest expense, no commentary yet on next year. Although, our cash spend has been less than what we're expensing, so you can expect it to go down more. We'll give some color on that towards the end of the year. But, as a percentage of sales, you'd have to look at what your model projects for volumes.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is actually Matt (35:01) on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just with respect to the challenging production environment, you were very clear that labor was the bulk of that. But was it all labor issues you're referring to or is there something else on the land development side, or even lingering weather delays that we should be thinking about?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Matt (35:27), we indicated in our prepared remarks, it was primarily labor, but there was also some community delays, primarily from earlier in the year, that impacted our ability to get homes begun on time, and then ultimately get closed on time, that had a portion of it. So, the way to read it is, the majority was labor, some of it was community opening delays, and I think Bob indicated in his prepared remarks, some of that was driven by weather from earlier in the year that got us started slower than expected, and we were not able to make up as much ground as we anticipated. But the majority of it was labor.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, you disclosed a very balanced mix of a first-time move-up and active adult. So, just wondering if you could provide some historical context. How has that looked year-over-year? And then, maybe the relative strength of each one currently?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Richard. I can speak to a couple pieces there. We just began the break-out of first-time move-up in active adult last quarter. So, we don't have a huge amount of historical data at our fingertips. Perhaps, we could get back to you later with some detail, if we can find it there.","In terms of the demand characteristics for each category, both the first-time category, as well as the move-up category, had strong absorption growth for the quarter. I don't have at my fingertips the exact numbers. And then active adult was relatively flat, it was actually slightly down on a same-store sales basis, from prior. But the other two categories were up fairly strongly.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my \u2013 I guess, my second question.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There you go.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sorry about that. Too many pieces in the first one. Sorry about that.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Looks like you caught me trying to be sneaky there. I guess the question I had is a bit on the absorption pace trend during the quarter in each segment, and how it's currently trending. Can you give some color on that? And then a little color on the weakness in San Antonio, please?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Through the quarter, Haendel, if I'm understanding your question, through the quarter, we were relatively sort of normal seasonality there. Didn't see a tremendous amount of variation through the quarter. So, if you are asking sort of sequentially, there was nothing unusual there. We didn't see one month in the quarter spike.","In terms of San Antonio, did you ask specifically? We had some weakness in San Antonio, along with Houston, kind of offset by Dallas. It wasn't anything dramatic, but the net combine there had us down 5% in Texas.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Can you give us a little color on what's driving the weakness, though, in San Antonio, a little bit of market color?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Candidly, I don't have much more because it, frankly, wasn't a big move, one way or another. So, we didn't get real granular on that one. So, we could certainly look for that after the call, if we want to get back to you. But there was nothing unusual driving things in San Antonio. It wasn't a gigantic drop.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Question for Bob. Looking at the backlog conversion for the fourth quarter, you guys have been in the high-60%s the last couple of years. And I just want to get some clarification. I think your commentary was, it would be better than that, am I understanding you correctly? And are you able to maybe put a sharper point on how we should think about conversion rates into the fourth quarter, given some of the delays?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think what we were saying was not that it was better than that, but we'd be moving towards it, and that we would seek to catch up on the difference for what we've left on the table, to this point this year, through the first half of next year.","And you're right. The last two years or three years, we've been 66%, 67%. And so, that is something that we will look to get towards, but I wouldn't say we told you we were going to beat it.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks. And then I know you had said earlier, you haven't been incenting to keep buyers in the backlog, but have you seen any change in cancellation rates with the construction delays?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. The sales environment continues to be strong and, frankly, the level of inventory out there continues to be modest. So, those would both indicate not significant cancellation worries, and we certainly are not seeing a spike.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, actually, third quarter versus third quarter, it's 17.1% this year, it was 17.6% last year.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I noticed in new orders, it looks like your average selling price rose from $331,000 last year, to $358,000 this quarter, and that's an 8% year-over-year increase. And that's one of the better trends we've seen out of the homebuilders that are reported. What's driving the big uptick in order growth ASP? And is that something \u2013 and I know you're not giving forward guidance, but how critical is that in terms of offsetting higher labor costs and sustaining a 23% gross margin?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, this is Richard. It's reflective of a couple things. One is just the shifting mix from the prior investments that we've made in the Pulte category, the move-up category, primarily, which would have been our 2014 and early 2015 investments beginning to sort of come through.","And then secondly, obviously, the pricing environment. In terms of its overall impact on margins and profitability, again, we're not trying to give any projections for 2016, but ASPs matter. I'll just point out, it's one quarter, and we have to see what ASPs develop like, say, in Q4, as it reflects into our next year's backlog, et cetera. But it was a pretty significant move, you're right.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's nice momentum. And for Bob, I was surprised by the SG&A which looked a little bit elevated versus what I was thinking. I know you had a reversal of a charge in there, as well. Is this kind of like a transitory situation with lower revenues, when you convert your backlog you're going to get very good revenue growth? How should we be thinking, not just this quarter, because I'm not that concerned about it, but longer term about normalized SG&A levels as a percentage of revenues?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bob, certainly the volume of the business impacts our ability to leverage our overheads, and as we've talked about before, because commissions don't flow through our SG&A, our SG&A is much more fixed than others might be.","Certainly, we've got start-up and we've talked about the fact that, with all the community turnover this year, our start-up expenses are up. So I think, actually, about 25% of the increase year-over-year relates to community-related spend. But, certainly, we think that it is leveragable, because so much of it is fixed on a relative basis.","And just to highlight, with the $6 million net benefit, if you exclude that, we were $165 million of spend for SG&A, and as we had said at the beginning of the year, we predict to be between $160 million and $165 million every quarter. So it was consistent with what we expected to spend.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But, I'm just trying to understand, next year you are expecting to get better operating leverage off the SG&A line, correct? Like from...","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we'll provide some color going into the year of what we think our SG&A spend will be. And then, obviously, as Richard talked about, we've been investing to try and grow the top line. So, yeah, we think it's leveragable over time.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Good luck, guys. Thank you very much.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. Your land spend expectations of $2.3 billion this year, just even taking or adjusting for the delays on closings in this quarter, it seems like you're sort of targeting around 38% or something in that vicinity as a percentage of revenues, which is quite high, particularly given the fact that you already have close to 100,000 lots owned. So, I was wondering, are you implying a geographic or price-point repositioning that's forthcoming? Just given the fact that you have a very significant amount of land-owned already. You are forecasting a fairly elevated level of land spend now. Just wondering whether or not there's maybe certain areas that you feel your current land base can't provide you the opportunity to go into, and so that's some of what is driving the increased land spend?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, this is Richard. I'll offer three or four different pieces, there. First of all, roughly a third of our total lot count is still tied up in Del Webb positions, many of which are long-lived positions, and that trend is going to take years to modify. There's only so much we can drive out of each existing Del Webb position. So, when you look at our overall balance of land, you have to factor that in as a significant chunk, makes our matrix look a little different than others.","Secondly, Bob pointed out in the prepared remarks that we are skewing our land investment towards the shorter end, and most of our new land investment communities are roughly around 100 homes each, so at any kind of a normalized absorption pace, that's no more than a couple of year's worth in each land position.","So, while our land spend is certainly up, the characterization of it or the mix of it is significantly different than Pulte's habits in the past of investing in very large transactions with long trajectories of six years, seven years, eight years at a time. So, the total health of our balance sheet as it relates to land, frankly, continues to get better and better.","And then thirdly, we continue to be very disciplined with regard to the way we're allocating capital, and our risk adjusted return criteria, we believe, is keeping us in check, as evidenced by the fact that our margins haven't fallen 200 basis points or 300 basis points or 400 basis points, which would be indicative, potentially, of reaching.","So, we are trying to grow the business. We feel good about sort of the long-term potential for housing over the next few years. But, we are paying attention, and we've seen nothing yet to suggest that over the next, two years, three years, four years, we should be worried, but just to keep our bets safe, we're investing the majority of things in shorter positions.","And then finally, I'd just point out that roughly 60% of our total spend in the quarter was development. Only about 40% is new acquisition dollars. So, for what it's worth, that's investing to bring lots on where we already have invested.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Steve, just to put a finer point on that, it's raw land. So, the land we've been buying over the last couple of years, we are now developing, and so the spend is on bringing those lots to fruition.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, yeah. I mean, your answer's one and three, I resonate strongly with. I would just say that the second point about how you are skewing your investment to smaller communities, I mean, that still would suggest that, let's say, your recent land spend is going to be what you are building on over the next couple of years. It still leaves the question of the existing land bank that's there, so whether you are buying more sort of shorter-dated lots, or whether you are using up kind of a FIFO basis, it still leaves you with a very large land position. But I hear you on the points one and three.","I guess my second question relates to the labor issues that we've heard a lot about. I was curious as to whether or not, in addition to some of the other considerations that you weigh when contemplating going out to the entry-level market more aggressively, if, underlying your assessment about opportunity, if the production challenges you're seeing from tight labor makes targeting this segment even less appealing than it did before?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, to be clear, we're focused really on the first-time buyer, as opposed to the entry-level buyer.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And there's a difference. The first-time buyer is typically \u2013 we're seeing a $300,000 to $400,000 urban product serve them. And I'm not hearing or seeing differences in labor challenges there versus any other segment.","I just want to comment on your point, too, around land spend. We hear you that we have a large land bank. And I guess the point I'm trying to make is that you can only get so much out of existing communities that have large lot positions, but the total dollars that we have invested in the business are going into shorter and shorter positions, which we feel like is a really good risk mitigation tool and is far different than our prior behavior.","So, you have to dig beneath the numbers to really appreciate the way we're running the business. And frankly, we can't be focused on returns so aggressively and not pay a lot of attention to the balance sheet. So, we hear your concern and I want you to know we are paying attention to that a lot.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, I appreciate that, and thanks very much for the answers.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Susan.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","You mentioned in your comments that you're at about 60% of your closings are commonly managed. That's up pretty considerably year-over-year. Given all of these issues that we've talked about on this call, how do you think that that has helped you, or how do you think the commonly managed plans have helped with that? And maybe are there any changes in the way you are rolling it out, given what you are facing?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Susan, I would say, if anything, the commonly managed plans give us an advantage in two regards. One is our absorption pace. The commonly managed plans are all consumer tested. We have a warehouse facility here in Atlanta that we bring buyers through to test all of our plans before we put them out into the field, and I think our absorption rates per community are being helped by designs, candidly, that our consumers tell us they really like.","And then specifically, we believe it's helping to hold up our margins. That, along with the pricing data that Bob gave are the two components that we feel are helpful, so those are the benefits from commonly managed plans, and we're really pleased that it's this big a portion of our total production.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then at the beginning of this month, we finally had the implementation (50:58) of TRID that came in. Have you seen any disruptions related to that or anything that has changed meaningfully?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly for us, I would tell you we were ready for it. We have loans in production under the new process. Actually some of them are slated to close in October. I think it's too soon to tell from an industry perspective. I'm hearing that people were generally ready, smaller mortgage lenders might be having a little bit more systemic issues with it, and so time will tell. But we haven't seen it as an impediment to this point. So, so far, so good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Following up on Susan's question about the new mortgage rules. With their initial proposed implementation being right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, was there any volatility around your order flows, or trying to get contracts and mortgage applications in?","And, really, I guess the question there would be, was there any pull forward of orders from 4Q into 3Q, as a result of that original implementation date?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly not for us, Nishu.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Great. And I know there has been a lot of discussion about the cost issues. Just taking a step back. I think the broad-level concern that investors have is that, with labor and then, obviously, land as well, prices running the way that they have, that the dynamic is if they would threaten \u2013 and it would threaten to overwhelm pricing power, which has obviously slowed from where it was a year or two ago. And, therefore, threaten the longer-term profitability of the business.","I know, obviously, you're not, and you've said this many times, giving forward guidance; but Richard, as you sit back and look at the dynamics that are in place right now, would you share that concern? Is that a legitimate concern? Or do you see a situation in which it's a healthy dynamic which is driving those cost increases, and therefore, there should be the pricing power longer-term to match those cost increases. Or do you share that concern about the unhealthy dynamic?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nishu, I'll say it this way. I understand people's concern about it, overall. I can simply tell you that, given our visibility into our backlog, we have not yet seen it manifest itself in terms of significant pressure. Given our Q4 closings that are upcoming, as we've indicated, we expect margins, frankly, to be about what they are in Q3, which is a very robust level.","Again, I won't comment on margins going forward. We don't have enough visibility to really do that. We'll try to give you as much as we can each quarter regarding kind of the next quarter, overall. So, I certainly understand it, but I do think that the normal tendency in this industry that I've seen in my time, has been for us to be able to get price generally to offset costs.","I can't guarantee that that's the case going forward, but that would be an expectation that would be reasonable based on what we've seen throughout the industry. I do think that there is an acute shortage of some trades today that have not come back as quickly into this business after the last downturn, and I think it's been elongated more than many, including us, in the industry would have expected. Having said that, we'll work our way through it, and live to fight another day, so to speak.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, gentlemen.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Ken.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, your gross margins, at the 26% level, pre the interest, have been steady. I wonder, could you highlight some of these components? Because your commonly managed plan, which obviously was part of your redesign process, in addition to just being very steady and focusing on a more, capital-return model. Could you highlight how much that community, you said, Richard, that you think it's helping. I assume you have some metrics around that? Talk about the labor, how much that's going up? And have you considered paying the people more to get more labor on-site? Because some larger builders haven't really highlighted this labor issue, but they've done more. So, I'm just trying to figure out the different components, as you think about your very steady gross margins?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, well, certainly, our margins, we think, are a factor or are impacted by lots of things. First of all, the land we're buying, the process we're using, the value creation efforts that we've talked about. So, you've seen lot premiums increasing, options increasing. Maintaining low discounts because we're not doing a lot of spec building.","Clearly, things that will influence our margin going forward are; land prices are going up, so we'll have an increase there, and labor rates will change depending on different markets. So, I don't think you can point to any one thing, commonly managed plans or anything else, that says this is why margins are what they are. It's the way we're approaching the business and all those different things that we think will allow us, over time, to generate higher gross margins than we historically would have.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Ken, this is Richard. Just to add one other quick thing. Higher relative to what others may be doing with their business. To Bob's point, our business model is such that we believe the commonly managed plans, the pricing, et cetera, help us to stay at the high end. We are obviously subject to market conditions. We're subject to labor pressure. We are paying more for labor than we have. But on a relative basis, we continue to outperform on the margin line, we think, because of all the pieces that Bob ran through.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. You obviously, at your Analyst Day talked about capital allocation, but you're sitting on quite a bit of cash. You're starting to buy back. You're having measured spend on your land more geared to developments, which means you can obviously harvest that land.","Have you got a little more comfortable around, perhaps, liquidity levels that we should target? I mean, you're at about 30% now. I mean, as we model rising cash, can we just always assume you're going to be largely putting that back into sales, given your moderate view on how the housing recovery is unfolding? I mean, you guys have bought back...","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as we highlighted, we like leverage between 30% and 40%. We were underlevered coming into this quarter, obviously, you saw we borrowed some money late in the third quarter, and you'll see in the Q that we actually were borrowed on our revolver at a point in time during the quarter.","So, most of liquidity that we had we spent during the quarter. Obviously, as closings start to ramp up and with the borrowings, we ended the quarter with a fairly sizable cash position, but we're working with that too. So, we highlight that we have a pretty big spend on land and development in the fourth quarter, roughly $800 million.","We've talked about the dividend, we've obviously been buying back stock. So, we're looking out over the next 12 months and looking at the capital profile, and we like where we sit today, at 30% or 31% debt-to-cap. So, it's not as much about managing what's the dollars that we want to keep in the bank, because those move every day. It's how do we keep liquidity sufficient to do the things we want to do. And our capital market activity will help to drive that, offset, obviously, by closings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT","Morning, everyone. First question I had, could you give us a sense of what percentage of closings have been spec versus dirt over the last couple of quarters?

I apologize to everybody else on the line.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. No problem. Was just trying to get a sense of the gross margin spread between spec and dirt and what percentage over the last couple of quarters have been spec closings versus dirt closings?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jay, I don't know exactly what the closing profile is, but what we can tell you is that for the last couple of years, we've been between 15% and 20% spec starts. And what we've talked about for a couple of years now is we don't mind spec starts at all, because you don't see much margin degradation, as long as you sell it before it finals.","The other thing I can tell you is we have very little spec final on the ground. We were at 340-ish units at the end of September, and that number has held pretty constant over time. So, again, we are not uncomfortable with spec. The margin differential isn't big, unless you have three or four of them on the ground at one point in time, in which case, oftentimes, you have to discount the homes.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT","Got it. I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should model a little bit more spec coming in in 2016. The other question I had, with you guys taking out the term loan, should we expect you to redeem the 2016 notes, the, I think it's $480 million. Should we expect you guys to redeem those at maturity and then look to refinance the term loan? Or how are you thinking about the debt structure at this point?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we've talked about it for a couple of years now, in terms of how we're looking at maturity profile. Obviously, we went short on this particular one. The rate is very attractive, the market was very supportive, and it happened to be at a point in time when the capital markets were a little bit unsteady. So, we really like the execution on the term loan that we did.","Looking forward, obviously, a lot of it will depend on capital needs, timing of that. Obviously, the big maturity is the one that's next year. And that obviously factors into every or any decision that we're going to make over the next nine months before we get there. So, no firm commitment on how and when we'll deal with that, but it's sort of next in the queue.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee CRT","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I know we're way over time, so I appreciate you staying on to answer a couple more questions. Going back to the comment about the active adult segment, and I think you said that absorption there was slightly down year-over-year, on a same store basis. I was wondering if you could just give us some commentary about, are you surprised that the active adult segment is not seeing maybe a stronger lift or better absorption at this stage of the cycle? Is there anything in particular about the Del Webb product that's notable about, or maybe location-wise, that's affecting that absorption trend? And have you thought about maybe introducing a different kind of Del Webb product? Could you go more urban or maybe high-rise with the Del Webb brand as well? Any thoughts on that?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Buck, this is Richard. The active adult buyer is obviously continuing to read sort of the broader signals overall, and they typically do lag more than the other categories. Having said that, we did close out several positions in the Southeast part of the country that were Del Webb, that probably had as much to do with it as anything.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And maybe I missed it earlier in the call. Did you guys give the net order comparisons by brand in this quarter?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we did. Although, I indicated that both the first-time category, as well as the move-up category, were up nicely, and then Webb was down some...","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.

My name is Katina, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Katina, and good morning. I want to thank everyone for participating in today's call to discuss PulteGroup's Fourth Quarter Financial Results. On the call today are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Schweninger, Vice President and Controller.","Before we begin, copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted on our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com.  Further, an audio replay of today's call will also be available on the site later today.","Please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including references to gross margins reflecting certain adjustments, is reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the press release and as an appendix to this call's presentation slide deck.","Finally, today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","With all that said, let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the last couple of years, we have been on the record as saying that we thought demand for new homes was stable. And at roughly the 300,000 level, the numbers support this position. ","Looking ahead to 2012, our planning assumption is that we will experience a similar level of demand. While there are signs this may prove conservative, we are not relying on higher demand to improve our results. Instead, as we have discussed on prior calls, in late 2010, we undertook a comprehensive review of our business to identify those areas offering the greatest opportunity for improvement. ","Executing on the findings of this review, we spent 2011 developing and implementing a series of actions to improve our fundamental operating and financial performance in key areas, including margins, overheads and inventory turns with a view to improving our return on invested capital over time. ","The underlying initiatives range from value engineering and should costing to overhead reductions, new pricing strategies and re-weighting some of our market positions. ","Over the course of 2011, our efforts gained traction and have supported the steady improvement in the company's results. That trend continued, and in some areas, accelerated in the fourth quarter. In a minute, Bob will review the details of the quarter, but there are a couple of numbers I'd like to highlight, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we have made.","On a year-over-year basis, our Q4 adjusted gross margins expanded by 200 basis points to 18.6%. Much of the gain in the quarter was driven by cycling through some older communities and bringing newer communities online, plus an increase in the number of move-up homes closed in the period. ","What makes our results even more compelling is that we expect benefits associated with our 2011 work on house cost reductions and operating efficiency to become visible in 2012 and beyond, allowing us to build on the margin gains we have already realized. ","While adjusted margins have been rising, our overhead costs have been falling, as SG&A in the quarter dropped to 10% of revenues. Through the combination of better gross margins and reduced overheads, our operating results improved dramatically in the period. And based on current expectations, we see opportunities for further margin progress in 2012. ","Along with our improved operating results, we are making decisions that align with changes in how we want to allocate capital going forward. As we discussed on our last call, we have made changes in how we evaluate assets and prioritize markets and projects and how we can move more efficiently -- more effectively risk adjust project investments. ","It takes time to meaningfully move the needle, but we are making different decisions. For example, in the fourth quarter, we completed $64 million in land sales representing about 3,500 lots. Most of these transactions involve projects that weren't coming online for several years and required significant additional development dollars. We made the decision to exit these assets with a view towards redirecting our investments and development spend on more immediate projects that we feel will generate higher returns. ","At the same time, we put approximately 2,800 lots under control with most being finished lots to be taken down in the near term. We are committed to bringing our land supply into better balance. Over time, these types of transactions can help drive better returns, while freeing up dollars for other uses. ","Initially, we plan to use excess cash principally to reduce leverage. On this front, we were able to repurchase almost $260 million of debt in the quarter. For 2011, our total debt retirement was $324 million. ","Within our organization, we have been and will remain focused on effectively managing margins, overheads, inventory and capital investment with the goal of generating improved shareholder returns. This focus is critical given the current state of housing demand. ","Having said that, I think it's fair to say that there's a growing sense of optimism about the U.S. housing market. We would agree that there are reasons to be positive about the potential for housing demand, including the following big themes, which are often raised: first, after 6 years of decline, new home sales are simply due to improve; second, demographic drivers of population growth and household formations will begin to exert themselves; third, home prices and interest rates make today's homes such a clear and compelling value that homebuyers will move off the fence. There is also supporting data for optimism, including the increased cost of renting versus homeownership, the shrinking inventory of homes available for sale, as well as survey data, which demonstrate the belief among 2\/3 of the population that now is a good time to buy a home. ","Closer to home, there is even our company-specific data, which shows signs of better traffic coming to our communities and anecdotal comments from our field regarding the improving level of buyer interest. When we put these and other data points together, at a minimum, we grow increasingly confident that market demand is and should remain stable. However, as stability turns into more meaningful year-over-year growth, PulteGroup's land pipeline and access to capital help to put us in a strong competitive position. ","It's still early, so we have to wait and see how 2012 ultimately develops. The good news for PulteGroup is that we have opportunities to further improve our results even without an uptick in demand. We expect that continued margin expansion and overhead control will be the key drivers to PulteGroup achieving profitability for 2012. ","Now let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more details on PulteGroup's fourth quarter results. Bob?","Robert  Shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard. First, let me cover some specifics on the quarter. Home sale revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 1% compared with last year. The increase was driven by a 3% increase in average selling price to $271,000, partially offset by a 2% decrease in closings to 4,303 homes. ","As you can see on Page 7 of our webcast slide, our adjusted gross margin was 18.6%, an improvement of 200 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year and up 10 basis points over the third quarter of this year. ","For the quarter, our margin improvement over the prior year primarily reflects the closeout of some lower margin legacy land positions, which are being replaced with higher margin land positions, as well as a favorable mix of higher margin move-up homes closed in the period. ","As noted in our press release, we recorded $24 million of land-related charges in the fourth quarter. These charges include: $11 million of impairments on existing communities, $3 million of pre-acquisition costs on assets we have elected not to pursue and $10 million of impairments on properties we have approved for sale. ","SG&A for the quarter was $117 million or 10% of home sales revenue. Our SG&A for the period reflects the actions taken by the company to reduce operating expenses in Q2 of this year and last year, as well as a $7 million benefit related to certain reserve adjustments. Our SG&A was down from $151 million or 13% of revenues last year and was consistent with the third quarter of this year, if you exclude the Q4 benefit from the reserve adjustments. ","We remain focused on our SG&A spend and are properly sizing our operations in alignment with current business conditions. At present, we expect 2012 SG&A spend to be consistent with our earlier guidance in the range of $475 million. ","As Richard mentioned, we sold 23 parcels, which included approximately 3,500 lots during the quarter. Those sales generated $64 million in cash proceeds and approximately $16 million in pretax profits. We were also able to repurchase $257 million of our debt for $252 million during the quarter, including $11 million -- including $80 million of bonds that mature in 2014 and $177 million that mature in 2015. Based on the valuations recorded in the acquisition of Centex, this resulted in a book loss of $2 million. ","For the quarter, our mortgage and title operations reported a pretax loss of $27 million. This represents income from current operations of $13 million offset by a $40 million charge related to potential future loan repurchase obligations. ","During the quarter, we originated $622 million of loans, and our capture rate increased to 82%, reflecting the challenging marketplace homebuyers are facing when trying to secure mortgages from third-party lenders. ","I'd like to address the mortgage repurchase reserve adjustment we recorded. As we discussed on our prior earnings call, and as you can see on Page 11 of our webcast slides, we experienced a heightened level of repurchase request in Q3, which continued throughout the fourth quarter. We believe this is consistent with the experience of others involved in the mortgage origination business. Based on this, we adjusted our current accounting to reflect an increase in the number of repurchase requests we expect to receive in the future, as well as a 1-year extension of the period over which we expect to continue receiving such requests. Our estimate now reflects that we'll continue to receive requests through the end of 2013. ","We continue to aggressively challenge each of the exposures we face related to our historical loan origination operations. We're in continual dialogue with our counter-parties and are working hard to refute or limit any exposure to repurchase requests we received. We will also continue to seek a comprehensive resolution of these issues, although this may take time for us to accomplish. ","Our fourth quarter results also reflected income tax benefit of $23 million, which resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. ","In summary, PulteGroup reported net income for the quarter of $14 million or $0.04 per share. This compares with a net loss of $165 million or $0.44 per share last year. ","In total, our fourth quarter net income includes $27 million of significant net items. Following is a summary of those items and where they're recorded in our income statement: land-related charges of $24 million, of which $11 million is recorded in home sale cost of revenues, $10 million is in land sale cost of sales and $3 million is other income and expenses. ","Gains on land sales of $16 million is recorded in land cost of sales, the $40 million increase in mortgage repurchase reserves are in the financial services expenses, the $2 million loss related to Q4 debt repurchase activity is in other income and expenses and the $23 million income tax benefit is in income taxes. ","Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash, which is consistent with September even after taking into account our Q4 debt repurchase activity. ","Our house and land inventory decreased $145 million from December of last year in part reflecting the impact of our capital efficiency initiatives, including land sales. ","In total, we have $3.1 billion in senior debt, of which $96 million matures in 2012. After the repurchase activity in the fourth quarter, our revised maturity profile includes the $96 million in 2012, $182 million in 2013, $575 million in 2014, $492 million in 2015 and $1.8 billion in 2016 and beyond. ","Looking at other activity in the quarter, we generated 3,084 sign-ups from 700 communities. This represents a 1% increase over the sign-ups we reported in Q4 last year. However, you may recall that we adjusted our processes for reporting sign-ups last year that resulted in a onetime cumulative catch-up of 200 sign-ups that related to earlier periods. If you exclude those units, our sign-ups increased 8%. It's important to note that this increase was generated from 11% fewer communities. ","As of December 31, we had 3,924 homes at backlog, valued at $1.1 billion, consistent with the 3,984 homes in backlog last year. ","In the quarter, we also roughly put 2,800 lots under control through 21 different transactions. The majority of these lots are finished and are structured as option takedowns available to us in the near term. ","We continue to review existing and potential new land transactions with an eye toward improving our long term risk-adjusted returns, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to enter or exit land positions as they present themselves. ","Now I'll cover a few final homebuilder data points. We ended the quarter with 5,500 homes under construction. The split between sold and spec is about 50-50. Of the spec units, roughly 1,500 were finished, which is down 20% from the prior year. ","Finally, you'll note that in the supporting schedules in our press release, that we've changed our reporting to reflect 6 segments, which we hope will help in your analysis of PulteGroup's operations. This will obviously be incorporated into our annual report and all future filings. ","Now let me turn the call back to Richard.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. Before opening the call to questions, let me offer the following thoughts about market conditions. In the east, demand in our New England markets remained challenging, but we have a number of well-positioned communities open and to be opened, so we feel pretty comfortable heading into 2012. ","Overall, economic conditions in the Washington D.C., Northern Virginia market have slowed, but PulteGroup's business continued to benefit from a number of well-placed communities that experienced strong buyer demand and good pricing. ","Heading south, we continue to experience some demand softness in the Carolinas and Georgia, but this was more than offset with continued strong performance by our Florida operations. As we have talked about throughout the year, Florida was a big upside surprise for us in 2011. ","In the middle third of the country, the Midwest continued to grind through tough economic conditions. Consistent with most of the year, Michigan continued to deliver much improved unit volumes, while Chicago remained one of the more challenging markets in the country. After a strong first half, Texas slowed in the back half of the year, including the fourth quarter. Assuming the local energy-oriented economies of the state hold steady, we would expect these markets to improve over time, especially as these markets lead the country in job growth. ","Out west, we are pleased that our large investment in Arizona continued to outperform relative to expectations. There is still supply in the market, but the inventory of homes has dropped and remains the target of sophisticated investors, so buyers are seeing quality and value within new home communities. ","Our operations in the Pacific Northwest experienced improved demand, although much smaller volumes, driven by the land positions we acquired late in 2010. ","In general, California remains choppy. Well-positioned communities with the right product offerings are doing okay, but buyers can afford to be very selective, which is slowing sales paces in some markets. ","As for 2012, while we won't provide any specific data, we will say that we were very pleased with business activity in January, which was consistent with our expectations heading into the year. I have been out in the markets extensively over the past several weeks, and while it's still too early to get a read on the selling season, I am pleased with what I saw and the comments I've heard from our operations. ","As I said earlier, demand for new homes has been relatively stable, although at historically low levels for much of the past couple of years. There are reasons to be optimistic about medium and long-term demand, but it will be interesting to see how 2012 develops. ","Over the near term, our strategy is to focus on increasing absorption pace in existing communities, as it is the most efficient way to grow earnings while demand sorts itself out. We will continue to allocate capital appropriately and to invest selectively in high-returning projects. ","Before opening the call to questions, let me thank all of the employees of PulteGroup, who have done a great job delivering a superior home buying experience to our customers and significant gains in the operating and financial performance of PulteGroup. ","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] So Katina, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut representing JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first thing I was hoping to get a little bit more detail on is the mortgage put-back situation, and in particular, kind of I guess understand the addition to the reserve and the continued high request. But I was hoping also to get an update on some of the Centex legacy-related lawsuits that you mentioned in the third quarter. And also I think just more broadly, why the higher level of put-back requests have persisted in your view in the last 3 to 6 months?","Robert  Shaughnessy","Sure, Mike, it's Bob. I'll deal with the losses issue first. We have not had any update to that. So again, we were never named as a party to that suit. We were made aware that it exists. I'm not aware of any progress on it, and so I would say we're in the same position we were 3 months ago. With respect to the mortgage put-back requests, I think it's hard to say. I think you would see in the marketplace that everybody has said we are seeing an increase in these sorts of things. I think we're not an outlier in that, obviously. As you can see on the chart, they've spiked up sort of post-June of this year, and they have been trending in a range a little bit above 100. It trended down towards the end of the year. We're not getting any feedback from the folks that are asking us for these to say, a, that they are close to the end. It's just we've identified more and here you go. We don't see a change in the pattern of them. We've talked about before that the vast majority related to 2006, 2007; that continues to be true. We continue to be able to identify things that we can refute or cure these with at rates that are consistent. We haven't seen a significant change in the severity, so really it's just more of the same. And so when you look at the accounting we did, it really reflects 2 things. One is because we've seen this continue on, if you remember back in June when we talked about this, we said, \"Look, we've dialed it out another year because we don't see anything suggesting that it might stop in the terms that we thought it would.\" Six months later, we're looking at it. And again, at a slightly higher level, we don't see it slowing down, so we thought it prudent to take it out another year. And then again, while we were doing that, we adjusted for the different variables again, incident rate, our ability to refute it, the severity of the claim. So if you look at where we are today, I think absent changes in the amount of requests that we get or the severity of them, if we just went out another year, we think it would be about $20 million to $25 million. And that compares to an increase for a year back in June, which we said we thought was about $19 million. So again, we're not seeing a huge change in the behavior, just a little bit more of it and more time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood representing Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the land strategy. The changes to your land purchase methodology that you mentioned last quarter leading to some reshuffling of the land portfolio, so a material difference here. And I wanted to understand, is this related to the, basically a change in the financial framework you've been using? Or is it related to changes in expectations of how long you think the recovery is going to happen? The kind of trajectory, so is it a change relative to a few years ago of your operating outlook? Or is it the financial metrics you're using?","Richard J. Dugas","Nishu, it doesn't have a lot to do with our change in the outlook for the market. It has to do with us thinking we need to be more rigorous on how we manage the overall portfolio for the company. Specifically, as you, I think, are aware, we used to have a 21% IRR hurdle for all land projects. We've now adjusted that and made it risk based. So a longer land project with more risk is going to have to meet a much higher return threshold and one that's a finished lot purchase that's significantly less risk would be closer to, let's say, 21% versus maybe 30% plus in threshold. All of that is with a view toward driving better ROIC. I don't think it's news to anyone that we have too much land given the market today, so we're looking to enhance our portfolio by ensuring that future land takedowns are met with a more rigorous hurdle assessment, like I just mentioned. In addition to that, we're taking some action on existing land parcels that we can't get to for 5, 6, 7 years and choosing to sell some of those and redeploy that capital into better areas. So overall, we want to bring our land supply into better balance, and we're pleased with the progress we've made. Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add anything to that.","Robert  Shaughnessy","No, agreed.","Richard J. Dugas","Okay.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up also on that topic. If we consider the implications of this change in land strategy division by division, which division is it having most impact on? So for example, were land sales concentrated more in Centex or Del Webb, let's say? Or the Pulte side of things? And so how is it -- how do you think it would shape the strategy in the divisions going forward?","Richard J. Dugas","I don't think the strategy in terms of rebalancing would have a whole lot to do with the mix by brand, which I think is what you're referring to. It's more specific by geography, Nishu. So as an example, if we have a very long land position in a given market, such as Florida, that might be an area where if we have projects that have a 10-year life, we might be willing to sell off pieces that are in years 6, 7 and 8, whereas in a market that we're fairly light on land and need investment, such as say, Charlotte, we might be in the market to purchase. So that's an example of kind of the rebalancing overall, but it's not specific to one brand for our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman representing Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","I guess if we think about the gross margin improvement and recognize that you've been acquiring finished lots, I think you said 2,800 for the quarter, how should we think about the margins in the new acquired lots? Are they equal to or better than that? And then recognizing that your profitability has improved so much and your very impressive SG&A leverage, how should we be thinking about the deferred tax asset and direct expectations on when you might put that back on balance sheet?","Richard J. Dugas","So Ivy, I'll take the first piece and then throw it to Bob on the DTA. On the margin side, we are seeing better margins from new communities that are beginning to flow through. And that's in the range, I would say, of a couple hundred basis points in general better than some of the legacy positions that we're closing out of. It's also helpful, frankly, that some of the legacy positions we're closing out of were not our strongest performers. In some cases, the delta can be greater than that. Also, the excitement for us internally, and I don't know if everybody caught this on the call, is that we don't feel that a lot of the margin improvement we saw in 2011 was really a result of the operating efficiency things that we've been working on, such as pricing strategies and value engineering and should costing, but that should begin to flow through in 2012. So we expect better margin performance from here, not just as a result of mix or a new land portfolio, which was primarily driving it in '11, but more from the things we've been working that take a little time to flow through. So with that, Bob maybe you can handle DTA.","Robert  Shaughnessy","Sure, the DTA, I think I'm right about this, nobody has reversed any yet. And some people are further along in the profit profile than we are. We've had some dialogue, and there are competing views, can you record it when you've got 2 years of profitability and a view towards profitability? In the third year, do you need profitability for 3 years? I think that will work itself out, and I think as we mentioned in the past, we won't be the first person online on that and typically on an issue this significant, there'll be a cadence to get set up. So I think we'll have to see how that plays out. The other thing again, just to make sure everybody remembers this, the significance of our deferred tax asset puts us in a position that when we are able to reverse some of the reserves, it is unlikely that we'll be able to reverse all of the reserves. So we'll have to look forward and understand what view towards profitability in the future we have, and how much of it can be it realized. So I think for us, rather than an all at one time, we'll get the entire deferred tax asset reserve reversed, it will be in pieces.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim representing Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wondering about your comments on Florida where you talked about there being big upside surprise. Do you have any concerns about that being a bit more challenging as more supply comes to market, given some of the delays and working through the distress there?","Richard J. Dugas","Dan, this is Richard. Frankly, no. And I candidly think this primarily has to do with the strength of our land positions in Florida, particularly as you look at our South Florida business, which is pretty large. We've got some terrific communities in, particularly, Southwest Florida, and we're doing extremely well in that market. We're also seeing some strength in Orlando, couple of communities in Tampa as well. But I don't get the sense in talking to our operators, and I've been out quite a bit lately, that, that's a real concern. I do think some of it has to do with company-specific position, so as an example, we don't seem to be competing a lot with the entry level market in Florida. A lot of it's move-up and active adult, which we're seeing strength today.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of the comments about looking for just improved results via the increased sales per community and also just what you want to do in terms of the IRRs and such. It was just definitely moving to closer end communities. We're definitely seeing the trends from other builders doing that. When you look at land opportunities, how do you see that right now, given the desire from others to look at land?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I guess, I just want to be clear. I think our margin improvement in 2011 was certainly benefited from an improving mix, particularly toward move-up. We benefited from new communities coming online, things like that. In '12, we think it's going to be more specifically the results that we've been working on so hard around new pricing strategies. Frankly, a lot of value engineering and should costing. We\u2019re opening new communities or redoing existing communities with product that's more efficient. It should be driving better margins, et cetera. As it relates to land purchases going forward, we are being very disciplined and candidly not extending ourselves into land positions that we're concerned or could be concerned about. They're A-plus positions. They typically have low risk. Since we instituted this new risk-adjusted profile back in the early to middle part of last year, we've seen a shift in the way projects are coming in for approval. And they're typically lighter takedowns. They're typically higher returns with a little better adjustment, frankly, versus the longer land positions that we've had. So as it relates to whether that's infill or not, specifically, I can't comment on that as much as I would say, I believe we're buying A properties or A-plus properties or not going out to marginal areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg representing UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This question was actually on the community count. And I want to get an idea, given the decline that you guys have seen kind of year-over-year at this point, if you think that rate of change is kind of leveled off as we go forward. And then what would you have to see from the macro environment from the broader housing market to think that it made sense to kind of go in and start accelerating community count growth as you look forward?","Richard J. Dugas","David, this is Richard. Let me start on this, and then I'll go to Bob. I just want to be clear with everyone. Right now, at the state this company is in, margin expansion is more important than pace than driving improved returns. And we have been very, very disciplined and continue to remain disciplined for the near term on that before we begin to expand dramatically. So with that backdrop, I just want to be clear about that. Maybe Bob can speak a little more toward count.","Robert  Shaughnessy","Yes. So we are at 700 for the end of the year. Our expectation is that it will actually decline between 5% and 10% during 2012. Again, what we are focused on is operational efficiencies so we're trying to make sure that the initiatives we have underway -- we've talked about should costing, value engineering, running common plan management through the business. We're trying to get that, a foothold of that in the business, rather than expanding footprint. So again, as Richard said, margin versus pace, but we are still, obviously, active in the market. As we talked about, 2,800 lots. 80% of those or thereabouts are finished lots, as Richard mentioned, predominantly light, so they are option take, so these are things we'll be able to get our hands on relatively quickly and then vertical pretty quickly after that. So again, we will be -- we are an acquirer of land, but for 2012, again about a 5% to 10% decline in community count.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could talk about the different segments in terms of absorption rates and kind of overall margin performance. How did active adults fare relative to the traditional homebuilding business? And with this pickup that you've seen recently and some of the more positive vibes you're getting from looking at traffic and looking at buyer comments and traffic from -- comments from traffic, has it extended into the active adult business?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. David, Richard here. The pickup in traffic and what we've seen to start the year is fairly across-the-board. Most markets, most segments across, so I'd say kind of everybody seems to be benefiting a little bit from a little bit of optimism here as it relates to more specifics. I don't know, Bob, if you have any detail.","Robert  Shaughnessy","Paces are up in our communities about 11% versus the third quarter. They're up about 9% versus the fourth quarter of last year. We are seeing pace increases really across the board in all the communities. Our closings are relatively consistent in terms of relative contributions from brand. We talked about the fact that other than the shift from first time, to move up the first-time buyer has been a little bit challenged. So our Centex community count is down a little bit. Those are some of the older communities that are closing, but I don't see a dramatic shift other than that.","Operator","Your next question comes as a follow-up from the line of Michael Rehaut representing JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to understand better in terms of 2012, and I recognize you're trying to not get too much into the weeds of granular guidance. But with the community count expected to be down 5% to 10%, I was just curious if you're expecting also a similar type of move for orders or if the shift to better absorbing communities would allow orders to still be up in 2012. And I guess as a follow-on to that, if you would expect SG&A to hold current levels that you reached in 2011 or have further reductions?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, this is Richard. One of the things, as Bob commented on community count, I was thinking we need to be careful everyone understands that community count is only one metric. And we do have a large proportion of large communities, particularly relative to many of our peers. And I hope everybody recognizes adding a 5 or 10 lot community, which is easy to do, can increase your community count, but not do a whole lot for your business. So we are expecting better paces per community. And I think Bob just indicated, we saw some pretty healthy improvements in paces per community in Q4 versus Q3 and prior year. So we're not going to give specific guidance on the numbers, but we're expecting a profitable year, and we believe that we have the right strategy in that regard. Bob, you want to add anything?","Robert  Shaughnessy","And as to SG&A, again, we had given guidance back after we had announced the restructures that we had done in the neighborhood of $475 million. We continue to feel comfortable in that range. So again, we've talked about obviously, people and marketing, as a lot of our cost, it's adjustable over time. But we don't have any initiatives underway. We are pretty comfortable. If we saw a change in the business, we would obviously rebalance the SG&A expense to reflect that.","Operator","Your next question comes as a follow-up from the line of Ivy Zelman representing Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","With respect to your operations being focused both on entry level and move up, there's been a lot of concern about underwriting and ability for people to get a mortgage. And I know that it's more stringent than it's been historically, but I wonder if you think that, that has been or will be a limiting factor and you'll be able to grow as the cycle commences, assuming no change? Or would you say it's been more a function of confidence and that's the mortgage liquidity, although stringent, assuming confidence improves, that there's definitely an ample number of borrowers that can, in fact, purchase today under today's more stringent environment? And maybe you can break out for us, I'm not sure if Jim Zeumer has the numbers, but what percent of your borrowers are actually below 700 in FICA score? Because the general conventional wisdom is that you have to have a 750 or better FICA score, as well as the perception that you have to put 20% down. So maybe you can help understand the dynamics of the underwriting for us, please.","Richard J. Dugas","Ivy, this is Richard. I'll start, and then Bob's got some detail. First of all, you're right, mortgage availability is tight. Frankly, it's been tight for a while and it doesn't appear to have had a significant change, say, over the last 6 months or so. Having said that, I would suggest there's significant opportunity for business to improve even without underwriting getting better as confidence comes back and buyers step into the market overall. It would certainly help things if conditions weren't quite this tight in terms of underwriting standards, but it does not appear that the efforts of the industry or others have made much of a dent in underwriting or appraisal standards yet. So having said that, our belief is that business could improve and should be able to improve with confidence coming back without underwriting getting better. Bob's got some detail for you on FICOs.","Robert  Shaughnessy","Yes, so the FICO scores, as we've talked about in our mortgage operations, FICO scores have been hovering right around 750 for the better part of 2 years. Again, our buyer's a little bit different maybe than the general population because with the active adult, they typically have better credit scores, but even with that, in the last year, our mortgage operation's roughly 20% that the people who have been approved for a mortgage are below 700; fully 40% are below the 750. And interestingly, if you think about the FHA market, which is roughly 30% of our originations, they don't have a requirement to increase their down payment above the 3.5%, unless their credit score's actually below 580. So there is obviously some availability, and it's not that they have to write a much bigger equity check until they get a little bit lower on the credit profile.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim representing Barclays Capital.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a few questions regarding your land buying, so I'd just -- maybe I'll just start with that. I was wondering if you could comment on the fact that you were able to book a $16 million gain on a $64 million revenue on your land sales. That was kind of interesting. I was wondering if you could tell us, do you think that's indicative in any way of what you see more broadly in terms of your land holdings? If there's -- if you were to put them out of the market, that there are opportunities for you to record a profit on a lot of those land parcels. And then secondly, related to your land, you said you bought 2,800 lots. I was wondering what you spent in terms of land and land development costs in the quarter. And then finally, I guess if you could give us a sense for what your land profile looks like in terms of what you bought. You talked about this new methodology for evaluating or doing feasibility analyses. You said that 21% was sort of your historical hurdle. What is your current blended IRR in terms of the 2,800 that you bought? What was the average IRR?","Robert  Shaughnessy","Okay, well, there's a lot there. So to your first question, in terms of land and the profit, I don't think that, that's an indicator as to anything prospectively. A couple of things to consider. Again, these are some properties that have been around for a while. They are pretty far out in the future. They may have been acquired in the Centex acquisition, so there may have been some purchase accounting around them. And so I would suggest that, that's not indicative of future transactions. The other thing is the process we follow is when we approve a transaction for sale, if there's a loss, we book it at the time of approval. And so when we actually close transactions, we're not going to book losses, but if we have a gain on a transaction that we approve, we have to defer that until we close. So at the -- by the time we actually close a transaction, we're actually going to only book gains. So if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter, we had $16 million on the transactions that closed, but we mentioned that there were $10 million in losses on properties that we approved for sale. So these things, depending on when closings take place, you get kind of lumpy income statements versus the cash that happens. With respect to the 2,800 lots, we put those -- we put 2,800 under control, so we've approved those. We haven't bought all of them yet. And so in terms of the returns on those, I would -- we don't give particulars on that, but I would tell you they are north of the 21% threshold that we have used in the past. I don't know, Richard, if you wanted to add anything.","Richard J. Dugas","No, I just -- I also wanted to say that on the first question, Steve, regarding the land sales, the primary reason for selling land is not necessarily to drive a gain overall. It's to drive our land balance to a more appropriate mix, particularly in a given market, as we look to deploy any cash into better returning communities. So we may have some gains, we may have some losses. As Bob indicated, it kind of netted out to about a $6 million positive this quarter. That's just that way the numbers fell.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joshua Pollard representing Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you talk about the cadence of margins throughout the year? Typically, you've seen margins go down in the first quarter, and I want to understand if there's enough strength embedded from the 2011 actions that you've taken for that not to be the case and whether or not we should expect profit every quarter. Is that what you're implying in your guidance?","Richard J. Dugas","Joshua, this is Richard. It's going to be difficult for us to make money in Q1, given the seasonality of the business overall. We certainly would expect to be profitable for the year. And with regard to margins, we're not going to give quarter-by-quarter guidance. Just to reemphasize that for the year, we would expect to see margin growth from 2011.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could ask another question on your land. I'm trying to understand what portion of your land falls on the fringe of your newer returns profile. In other words, what portion of your inventory would you sell if you could?","Robert  Shaughnessy","I think it's a relatively small percentage. Again, this won't be a seismic shift in the land position in the short term. Again, $64 million in this quarter. As I mentioned, we have approved other transactions that will close over the next, in some cases, 18 months depending on development requirements, so it's really -- I would call it pruning rather than chopping.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Joshua, just to add to that, I think it's kind of summarized in a number of the comments we've heard from people. The goal for us is better returns. It's not kind of growth at all costs. So that's our view with regard to all of these capital-related actions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger representing Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could -- I was little confused on the gross margin and impairments in the back of the table in your release. I think you have $8 million that's flowed through cost of goods. And you highlighted, I think, $24 million in your earlier remarks. Can you just detail where all of those charges were in the income statement?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, so there's $24 million. $11 million of that is recorded in home sale cost of revenues. $10 million is in land sale cost of sales and $3 million is in other income and expenses.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So again, in the table you have the back, you have $7.885 million in impairments and home sales costs. And you just said $11 million. Is there -- am I missing something?","Richard J. Dugas","It's the cap interest, which -- so it's -- the $11 million that I ...","Robert  Shaughnessy","So there's $3 million of the cap interest in that $11 million number. So if you just take a look at the non-cap interest, that's the number you're seeing in the table.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just on housekeeping, if I missed it, I apologize. What was the cancellation rate? And what's the total lot count now?","Richard J. Dugas","It's 19.8% was the cancellation rate, and total lots under control was 131,000.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall representing RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could shed a little light on the 200 basis points gross margin improvement. What -- if you want to break that down, what is the contribution from more favorable mix towards the shift in your -- towards your buyer, towards move-up product away from first time? And on the other side of that, what percentage of the improvement or how many basis points is the shift towards more profitable communities, newer land purchases as opposed to legacy closeout?","Richard J. Dugas","We typically haven't broken it down. Mix is a hard thing to really look at, because -- and I know this is going to sound like a nonanswer. But part of this is again, we've talked about the fact that there's more move-up business, so that's part of the margin equation. We've talked about that fact that some of the older communities are closing out, new ones coming on. That's actually part of the shift from first time to move up. So again, we've not tried to narrow it down to say how much of it specifically is community-based versus how much is segment-based.","Robert  Shaughnessy","The one thing I'll mention, maybe to help you a little bit, is just to entertain what that mix shift means. If you take a look at our mix this quarter, about 40% of our closings were kind of move-up oriented. That compared to 30% last year, and that's just strictly coming from the Centex side. So we had about 30% in this quarter versus 40% last year's quarter.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's actually -- it's actually what I was looking for. And I think Richard was talking earlier about the benefits of process engineering will start to show up this year. Can we get a ballpark in terms of gross margin basis points? Is this 50 or 100 basis points of improvement to expect? Because it's difficult to understand how material this will be in the big picture. You've obviously mentioned you're going to be profitable this year. Obviously, a lot of this will stem from the cost initiatives on the COGs line. Can we just get a framework for thinking about this?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Bob, I'm sorry we can't give you specifics on that at this point. I would just suggest to go back to a point we made earlier that the gains you saw in '11 were primarily a result of kind of the capital decisions we had made in the way that mix and new investments flowed through. Not a lot of that was driven by the value engineering, should costing, new pricing strategies, et cetera. So stay tuned on that. We prefer to be a show-me world versus prediction at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless representing Guggenheim.","James McCanless - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question I had, it appears if I just back out impairments from 3Q to 4Q, looks like gross margins went down about 90 bps, sequentially. Could you all discuss that, and what you did with incentives sequentially?","Robert  Shaughnessy","]","Incentives sequentially were consistent, right around 6%. Not sure what you've done with cap interest. There was a pretty big increase on a relative basis, Q3 versus Q4 this year in what ran through the income statement for CapEx, so my guess is that's what you're seeing.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, that's why when we give you the adjusted gross margin number, we were up sequentially from Q3 to Q4. The 10 basis points, but that takes out any cap interest impact.","James McCanless - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'll go double check that. Just going strictly off of what looked like land and lot impairments and then adding that back to what you showed for gross profits, so want to double check on that. And then wanted to ask also, with the talk out there about bulk REO and bulk foreclosure sales. I believe the pilot program starting for that, it's going to be ramping up. What are you all thinking about the impact that those bulk sales could have either on appraisals or potentially on impairments down the road? Could you discuss that a little bit?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Jay, we have not counted on a whole lot of that in terms of our thinking, because candidly, since it's out of our control. And kind of the same thing goes for what the President is discussing right now, including expanding the HART program, et cetera. So don't have a whole lot there. My guess is while a number of those things are going to be nice attempts, it appears that they are going to take a little bit of time to have an impact. So we don't know at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Barr\u00f3n representing Housing.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I guess, I wanted to ask you something I've been asking other builders, which is, it's been 6 years since the downturn began. And I guess a number of people have gone through foreclosure and short sale. And they've been locked out of the mortgage market. I'm wondering if you're starting to see some of those people come back into your sales offices, and whether they're starting to qualify to buy homes again.","Richard J. Dugas","Alex, this is Richard. It's hard to quantify specifically the impact of that, because I think there's perhaps a little bit of that phenomenon, but also you've got people who have not had qualification problems, who have just chosen for quite a long time to rent or to live with a sibling or friend. And with the preponderance of press out there now about how good a time it is to buy, how low rates are, the increasing cost to rent, you're pushing people toward the ownership side of the equation a little more than you were. So very difficult to give a specific answer to what you're saying. I think it's a little bit of all of that, that is beginning to show some seeds of improvement.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","My follow-up question was one of the things we do is we track all of your communities that you guys have on the website. And we've noticed year-over-year, the Centex community count has gone down pretty significantly. And I guess, the Pulte one has gone down as well a little bit. So I'm just trying to understand on the Centex side, what's happening there or what your future thoughts are on that segment.","Richard J. Dugas","Well, we certainly built out a lot of smaller Centex communities, frankly at a rate faster than the replacements have been coming online. But we're very excited about the entry level brand. As a matter fact, one of the value engineering initiatives we have underway right now represents some new product alternatives for that first-time buyer that we're going to be opening up in a number of markets early this year overall. So you're right. The community count for Centex has fallen. That's just as a result of kind of the runoff of a lot of smaller Centex communities faster than the replacement, because the majority of our recent investments has been for the move-up brand. But we're excited about the future for the entry level, and we'll look forward to commenting on that in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne representing Raymond James & Associates.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Quick question on the balance sheet. I just want to look at a quick line item here. I just noticed that the residential mortgage loans that you have available for sale, that line item on the balance sheet seemed to tick up quite substantially. Just wondering if that's more of a timing issue in terms of just -- or seasonal issue related to the processing those in loans. Or is there some issue in terms of more difficulty placing that paper back into the mortgage market that's occurring these days?","Robert  Shaughnessy","No issues there. That is actually seasonal and just the process that they're using. We've actually seen that clear already.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And lastly on the interest expense. I just noticed interest expense flowing through the cost of sales ticked up quite a bit. I guess even on a per delivery basis. Just wondering if that's kind of the sustainable run rate in terms of your delivery schedule. Or interest amortized per delivery, is that the numbers we should be looking for going forward?","Richard J. Dugas","We've talked about this, I think it was in Q2. We are, today, expensing -- 2011, we expensed about $185 million against the cash spend of about $220 million. Our expectation is that for 2012, that expense will move up to about $220 million. And at the time, we said that would be consistent with our cash spend. Based on the repurchases of the debt that we got through in the fourth quarter, our cash spend will be a little bit less now, it's down about $16 million, so closer to $200 million. But again, next year, you'll see relative to 2011, about a $35 million, $37 million increase through our cost of sale line for cap interest amortization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener representing KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The increase that you're having on what you just spoke about, it's obviously -- I think a portion of that is related to the Centex debt. Is that correct?","Robert  Shaughnessy","It is related to the Centex accounting, yes.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Now that increase that we're having this year, is that -- in 2012 -- as you look out into '13, does that continue increasing? Are we going to finally start seeing that abate, so you can get that interest expense?","Robert  Shaughnessy","I think it will go down or stay even. So it depends on our debt level at that point. It's how much is actually being capitalized each year. Again, the $16-ish million decrease in cash spend next year, some of it will benefit next year in the amortization off. The rest of it would impact '13 and '14. So again, it will -- it's not linear, so we don't get a dollar-for-dollar reduction if we reduce cash interest expense. The income statement follows on a lagging basis. But again, based on where we are, it should go down.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, good, and that will obviously, won't be a headwind in '13 then. Now I find it interesting, with your community count as it relates to G&A, when you said 5% to 10% for the year, was that a yearend or was that an average community count for the year?","Richard J. Dugas","Year-over-year. That's to the end of the year.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So fourth quarter, down 5% or 10%.","Richard J. Dugas","Correct.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then the decline that you had, how much of that would you actually tie over to the success you've been having in your fixed G&A?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I think that -- I don't -- I would say marginal at best. Yes, these are -- this community count, I mean we're not talking large communities with significant amount of fixed cost related to them. So most of our SG&A is other -- for other reasons.","Robert  Shaughnessy","Yes, the G&A improvement is largely, because I think Bob indicated in the script, the result of some actions we took in Q2 of '11. And we're getting the flow-through benefits of that now and expect it to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko representing SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just wanted to touch on Florida for a minute. It seems like most of the builders have been reporting pretty good order trends in Florida. Active adult and trade-up in your space, I think you had mentioned, and better land position. Can you talk about the composition maybe of the buyers you've seen maybe anecdotally? Are we getting snowbird or retirees off the fence, because the window there is maybe narrower and they don't want to wait another year? Is there a Canadian component with the dollar exchange? Can you talk about the composition of Florida?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Jack, for us, a good a bit of it is active adult. As an example, our Southwest Florida business is largely active adult purchases, and a lot of it is snowbird. Some Canadian buyers, some foreign buyers from Germany and other places. And frankly, it appears the seasonal trade, if you will there, the second-home purchases and the move down, our retiree purchases really started last winter, a year ago. And it's continued through 2011, and we're seeing a pretty strong season so far there this year. So that's the anecdotal comments I'll provide overall.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then I don't want to overstate it, I mean you got $1.2 billion of cash and 140 and change [ph] reserve on the rep and warranty side. One of the things that our checks have been pretty clear about is, I guess to be politically correct, the technicality of some of these put-back issues moving from the individual GSEs to the FHFA, you've seen that and you've also seen more technical put-backs, if you will. Can you talk about maybe your experience since August, September and the tick up? And what that piece of the elevated volume maybe is behind that?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, again, I think we commented on that. We don't see a change necessarily in the types of things that are coming to us, nor for the periods that they relate to. So I wouldn't necessarily agree with that there's some technical aspect to this. I think the counterparties are reviewing loan documents. And if they believe there was an error or omission in the rep and warranty, they ask us to repurchase or make whole. Obviously, we do everything we can to either cure what they think the issue is or refute it for a variety of reasons. But I don't think that there's a change in sort of the way they're behaving.","Robert  Shaughnessy","Just to add on to it. It's always really been a technical issue, so this is a strict rep and warranty-type contractual item. So it's -- I'm not sure what you mean by technical, but I would tell you it's always been technical.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the time we have for questions.

My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.","James Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer","Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our first quarter financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2014.","Joining me on today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that copies of this morning's earnings release, along with the presentation slides that accompanies today's call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today's call will also be available on the site later today.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","With that said, now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to speak with you this morning about PulteGroup's first quarter operating and financial results which show the company's continued gains against our key business metrics. Equally important, I am pleased to report that the positive January traffic and demand dynamics we discussed on our last earnings call continue to develop over the quarter helping to improve our absorptions per community and giving us confidence in the ongoing recovery of housing demand.","Specific to the company, our first quarter pretax earnings of $130 million and related financial results show ongoing success consistent with our value creation strategy and focus on driving better returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. As Bob will detail shortly, gains related to this work can be seen clearly in our income statement and balance sheet. There are a couple of points I would note to highlight our progress.","First, on comparable revenues, we were able to expand year-over-year gross margins by 580 basis points to 23.8%. Gross margins are also up 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013 making this the ninth quarter in a row of sequential gains. Last time our margins were at this level was back in 2005, a time when industry volumes and relating demand were obviously much higher than what we were experiencing currently. Stated plainly, we are running a much more efficient business today as we're able to generate much higher earnings at current production levels.","Second, our results show the continued benefits we are realizing from our strategic pricing strategy, which has given us a lot more opportunity to capture higher revenues and profitability for home. The average sales price for closings in the quarter was $317,000, an increase of 10% over last year. Yes, we were able to realize higher prices on our base house but as Bob will detail shortly, we saw even bigger percentage increases on option pricing and lot premiums. Again, this is reflective of our pricing strategies which focus on offering a great base house and then allowing the consumer to select those options and upgrades they value most and for which they are willing to pay.","In addition to the extensive new product development and testing work we are implementing for all new floor plans, we put a lot of analysis into the options we offer and our lot pricing strategy as we work to capture the maximum value from each home we sell. And finally, I would highlight that our sign-ups for the quarter which totaled 4,863 homes. The sign-up number is down 6% from last year but it was generated from 10% fewer communities, indicating improved absorption paces within our communities, a positive sign given the strength in last year's first quarter demand.","Given how demand developed and the favorable comments we have heard from our divisions during the quarter, I am really pleased with our sign-ups for the period. The combination of solid pricing, improved absorption pace and cancellation rates that dropped back below 12% for the quarter leaves me optimistic about the remainder of the spring selling season. We believe the industry is still in the early stages of what will be a sustained multiyear recovery but one that will develop at a more measured pace than passed housing recoveries given demand and supply constraints.","Certainly, we could see the pace of recovery accelerate but I think we would have to see an increase in the rate of employment growth and better mortgage availability especially for entry level buyers. To that point, we get a lot of questions about the entry level buyer and PulteGroup's strategy for addressing this segment which is most directly served to our Centex brand. At less than 30% of current overall housing demand compared with historical rates above 40%, this group is underrepresented in the overall housing recovery thus far.","However, we are seeing acceptable levels of entry level activity in certain markets and our most recent survey show millennials remain very positive about housing and homeownership. When demand from this buyer demographic returns, we will be ready. We continue to refine our product designs and seek new land investments that are well located to serve this buyer. We have the knowledge and financial capacity to react quickly as demand evolves and are excited about the future opportunities for the segment.","Now let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on the quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup indeed has gotten off to a great start in 2014 with continued improvement across a number of important operating and financial metrics. These gains allow us to post a strong Q1 financial performance. First quarter home sale revenues totaled $1.1 billion which is comparable with last year. As Richard mentioned, we realized a 10% increase in average selling price to $317,000 which was offset by the 10% decrease in closing volumes to 3,436 homes.","We were able to achieve this despite the difficult weather conditions in much of the country as our operating teams worked hard to minimize this impact on our production schedules. The higher average selling price in the quarter was driven by price increases at all three of our brands including 13% increases at the Pulte and Del Webb to $387,000 and $322,000, respectively, and a 5% increase at Centex to $203,000.","We did see a shift in the mix of closings during the quarter which break down as follows; 41% from Pulte, 32% from Del Webb and 27% from Centex. This compares to our prior year closing mix of 46% Pulte, 28% Del Webb and 26% Centex. With our land investment continuing to skew to our Pulte brand, we expect that our mix of closings will continue to be weighted toward move-up and active adult product.","For the quarter, our gross margin was 23.8% which represents an increase of 580 basis points over Q1 of last year and 60 basis points over Q4 of last year. Margins in the quarter benefited from mix of homes delivered in the period as well as our strategic pricing programs which allow buyers to select the lots and options that they value most. The success of this strategy can again be seen as lot premiums in the quarter increased 41% to $12,000 per home while option dollars gained 12% to $44,000 per home.","Margins in the quarter also benefited from further reductions in sales discounts which fell for 1.6%. This is down 180 basis points from last year. In dollar terms, sales discounts in the quarter were approximately $5,200 per home compared with just over $10,000 last year. While we're likely getting to the lower end range of what's possible for discounts, we'll keep working hard to squeeze out every dollar we can.","In addition to pricing benefits, we continue to focus on driving greater construction efficiency and lower build cost to our common plan and related known strategy. For the quarter, commonly managed plans accounted for 30% of closings, up from 21% in Q4 of last year keeping us on track towards our goal of 40% by the end of 2014. With rising material and labor costs, increasing the use of commonly managed floor plans is critical to our ongoing efforts to enhance margins.","Our current estimates show house cost up roughly $1,400 or about 1.2% for home from 2013. As we've commented on prior calls, rising land, labor and material costs are an increasing margin headwind. We see opportunities to enhance margins from here through common plan management, strategic pricing and other initiatives. But quarter-to-quarter volatility does exist depending of the mix of homes delivered and seasonal demand.","Turning to our overheads. SG&A spend in the first quarter totaled $145 million compared with $130 million last year. Our spend in the period is consistent with comments we made in Q4 and reflects investments we're making in support of common plan management, product and purchasing zones and our information systems. ","Our Financial Services business reported pretax income of $22 million in the quarter which is up from $14 million in Q1 of last year. These results include the reversal of $19 million of mortgage repurchase reserves offset by a decrease in operating profitability due to the more competitive operating conditions that currently exist within the mortgage industry.","We're obviously pleased to reverse a portion of our reserves related to mortgage origination exposure. This accounting reflects the improving housing market, recent settlement activity relating to known repurchase requests and the settlement of significant exposures relating to originations through the end of 2008 with a significant investor. We will continue to work diligently to minimize and resolve our repurchase-related exposures.","Looking at our taxes, we reported $55 million of expense which represents an effective rate of 42%. Our first quarter rate was higher than our previous guidance of 39% due in large part to adjustments to our deferred taxes relating to changes in certain state tax rates. In the prior year, we reported less than $1 million of tax expenses, maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.","In total, PulteGroup reported pretax income of $130 million for the quarter which is up 58% over the prior year. Net income for the period was $75 million or $0.19 per share compared with $82 million or $0.21 per share in 2013. We've gotten off to a strong start in 2014 and are well positioned to build on this performance as we move through the remainder of the year.","Looking beyond the income statement, we had 5,121 homes under construction at the end of the quarter of which 19% were spec. The spec percentage is comparable with Q1 of last year but down sequentially from Q4. During the quarter, we put 9,700 lots under control and invested a total of $325 million in land acquisitions and developments. As has been the trend for several quarters, most of these land positions are raw and require development, but we were able to increase the percentage of deals under our options would allows us to control but not own the positions until needed.","At the end of Q1, we had 120,000 lots under control of which 26% are under option. Roughly 23% of our lots are finished with another 19% currently under development. As previously reported, we authorized $2 billion for land acquisition and development in 2014 and we continue to target this level. We are committed, however, to remaining disciplined in our investment process and will invest only when acceptable risk-adjusted returns can be realized.","Looking at our cash flows, we generated $91 million of cash flow from operations despite the increase in our land investment activities. During the quarter, we spent $45 million to repurchase 2.2 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $19.95 per share. As of March 31, we had $190 million of capacity remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","We also completed our previously announced transactions to repurchase $246 million of senior notes. We recorded a charge of $9 million resulting from these redemptions. At quarter end, our total debt outstanding is down to $1.8 billion of which $1 billion matures in 2032 and beyond. And our debt to capital has decreased to 28%.","After completing all these transactions, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. The improvements we realized over the past couple of years in our operating and in turn financial metrics have been dramatic and are being recognized as PulteGroup has been upgraded recently by each of the major rating agencies.","Let me finish with just a few more data points before turning the call back to Richard. We generated net new orders for the first quarter of 4,863 homes which is a decrease of 6% from last year. As Richard mentioned, year-over-year community count was down 10%, so we did experience higher absorption paces in the period. Benefiting from the strong price appreciation we've driven, the dollar value of sign-ups actually increased 2% to $1.6 billion.","In the quarter, net sign-ups decreased 8% for Pulte, 6% for Centex and 4% for Del Webb. However, absorption paces were up 7% in Del Webb and 29% in Centex offset in part by an 8% decrease in Pulte communities. The year-over-year increase seen in our Del Webb brand is a positive given the deep land positions we maintained in those communities. ","We ended the quarter with a community count of 584 which is down 10% from the end of last year and consistent with our guidance that we expect to operate from an approximate range of 560 to 580 communities during all four quarters of 2014. We opened more than 40 communities in the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 190 new communities over the full year.","We ended Q1 with a backlog of 7,199 homes valued at $2.4 billion which compares with our prior year backlog of 7,825 homes at a comparable $2.4 billion value. In conclusion, our Q1 results represent a strong start to the year and are further confirmation that our efforts towards running a more efficient and profitable business are meeting with success.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Bob. As I said at the outset, we experienced good demand in the quarter with generally stable to rising prices and gains and absorption paces suggestive of buyers coming back into the market especially in March. We'll have to see how demand develops over the remainder of the spring selling season, but we are certainly encouraged by what we saw.","Taking this view down a level, looking at the East Coast, sales activity was stronger in the south and softer as you move into the northern markets. Demand trends were strong in Florida and generally positive up to the Carolinas, but as you move through D.C. and into the New England area, demand was respectable but certainly not as strong as the other areas in the east.","We saw a similar pattern in the central third of the country with demand in Texas arguably among the strongest in the country. Again, as you continue heading north, you can still see pockets of strength but conditions were a little more mixed. The one outlier is Michigan which continued to see good traffic and demand even in the face of the snowiest winter in more than a 100 years. Inventory is just so tight in Michigan that any available supply is quickly snapped up and often in higher prices.","The west obviously didn't have to deal with snow and cold, but I think the market is still finding its level after the significant price increases experienced over the prior 24 months. On a relative basis, the Pacific Northwest and Northern California saw better demand during the quarter while Arizona felt more pressure. As for April, we are seeing stable to slightly lower traffic levels of highly qualified buyers compared to March which is a normal seasonal trend and keeps us optimistic for demand over the remainder of the spring selling season.","As always, I want to thank the employees of PulteGroup as they are the people who really make this business successful. For a number of our markets, it was a tough quarter to be a homebuilder, so I want to recognize all those divisions that worked so hard to keep sales and production on track under some tough weather conditions. Thank goodness spring has finally sprung.","Finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to make you aware of a press release we will be issuing later today. I'm excited to share with you an announcement we made to our employees this week that we have named Ryan Marshall to become Executive Vice President of Homebuilding Operations and Harmon Smith has been named Executive Vice President of Field Operations. Both will be reporting directly to me. ","Ryan has been with the company for 13 years and Harmon 25 years. In addition to being strong operators, both have been instrumental in advancing our value creation strategy which has helped raise our financial and operating results to be among the best in the industry. And moving them into these new roles, we are aligning additional resources in direct support of value creation and allowing them to focus full time on advancing key underlying initiatives to ensure we realize the maximum benefits.","Some of you may have already met with them during market tours in Florida or Texas. For those who haven't, I'm sure there will be opportunities to speak with them in the future. The press release we issue later today will provide more details on these changes and their respective backgrounds of Ryan and Harmon. Thanks for your time this morning.","I'll now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we will open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Tiffany, if you'll explain the process we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bob, I realized you just gave us the absorptions by segments but I, truth be told I had a little trouble writing that quickly. Can you elaborate a little bit more on just the trends you're seeing and the patterns by buyer segment?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","In terms of absorptions\u2026","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes, I mean just wanted some more color on the whole idea at the entry level, buyers challenged and move-up, active adult might be better positioned and I just wanted either some more commentary to either prove or disapprove or just discuss that whole idea?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes. So what we saw was that we \u2013 I'll give you the data again. On sign-up, we saw 8% decline at Pulte; 6% at Centex, 4% down at Del Webb, but our absorption paces; Pulte was down 8%, Centex was actually up 29% and Del Webb was up 7%, so absorption paces are up 4% overall. And I think that there's a couple of things happening there. Certainly the Texas market was very strong in the first quarter which is where we have a really \u2013 a larger percentage of Centex operations and so that 29% pace increase is reflective of the really strong market we saw in Texas. The Pulte market was influenced in part by Arizona where we saw a slowdown from what we saw as really, really strong results last year. And again, the highlight to us is that across the board the Del Webb product absorptions were increasing during the quarter, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years that we've said that we think it's been a little bit slower back to market for them, but we saw nice demand out of them in the first quarter.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then the second question just on gross margin, I think previously you talked about all else equal, the debt reduction could have added maybe a point to the gross margin expansion. With the most recent debt refinancing and some of the increase in commonly managed plan contribution, can you comment on what the updated thoughts were there?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Adam, this is Richard. The recent debt refinancing won't impact margins until '15 and '16 and beyond given the way that we amortize interest overall. So we still like our margin trajectory. As we said, there is going to be quarter-to-quarter volatility from here, but we've been real pleased with what we've been able to do.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Just to clarify, year-over-year, the margin benefit from the reduced interest cost coming through cost of sales is 110 basis points. So that 580 basis points increase in total margin, 110 basis points is interest related.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Thank you, operator. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Ivy.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","One of the things you guys talked about is the common floor plan and all the success of the initiatives. Can you give us just the numbers with respect to the closing that benefited from the common floor plans and what do you anticipate over the multiple, say, next two years or so? I know you've given goals before, if you can confirm that they are on track or where you are, maybe ahead of expectations? I also think there is a lot of skepticism despite your great performance around the fact that your margin performance, gross margins specifically, is really just a result of purchase accounting from the Centex acquisition and that you've got all this old Centex mothballed stuff and it's all going to hit the P&L at some point and your runway going forward is not there as where we're optimistically viewing it. So maybe just a clarification, Bob, go through sort of the Centex legacy assets and much of which is gone from what I understand, but I think it would be really helpful especially for the bearers that are listening?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Ivy, this is Richard. A couple of thoughts. First of all, with regard to common plan management, we were at 30% of our deliveries in the end of Q1 from common plan management. That's up from 21% in Q4 and substantially below that earlier last year. We are well on track toward our goal of 40% by the end of this year and our long-term goal is 70%. So to answer that question, I would suggest that if anything we're at or slightly ahead of the pace that we projected to get to, so we feel very, very good about it and it's beneficial to the company. I'll answer the first part of the gross margin question and then throw it to Bob for more detail. Our gross margin efforts have been very, very focused on a combination of common plan management and strategic pricing actions that frankly along with mix are driving all of our margin benefit. In fact, margins on legacy land that has been around a while are in fact not benefiting from purchase accounting. They are actually a little bit of a drag on our margins overall relative to the land that we've underwritten the last four or five years. So, I would suggest for any of the bearers listening we're earning every single dollar of the gross margin improvement that we're getting. I'll just highlight again a couple of things Bob mentioned. Our discounts are extremely low and we are continuing to work those hard. Our option revenue is very high, a lot of premiums are very high and we're working on base house improvement through our common plan management work. So, purchase accounting doesn't have much to do with it. Maybe Bob can illuminate that a little more.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, just for color more than half of our closings in the recent quarter are from newer vintage lands, so stuff that wouldn't have been impaired. And we actually like that land better. To Richard's point, the margins are a little bit, not dramatically so, but a little bit better and I would suggest that the land we're underwriting today, we will feel better about too.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Let's remember that the purchase accounting didn't allow us to write land down to incredibly low levels. It was market levels at the time. So we did the right accounting but that's not what's causing our margin expansion.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Well, that's very helpful. Elaborate, if you would or ask you to elaborate on what is mothball today relative just to total company and that's not assets that you can get a return on. I know that you really changed course in your return focus and you paired down on assets that weren't going to give you that return. So for clarifications, how much of the land that you hold on balance sheet is mothball today and not going to generate the returns that would justify keeping them?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","In terms of percentage, we've got some longer life assets in the Del Webb portfolio but we've been pretty actively selling things that we don't think would generate a return over time. There was another $5 million in this quarter, several hundred million dollars over the last two or three years. So it is a small percentage of our book of what you would describe as mothballed and non-returning assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jacky Micenko with SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial","Hi. I got a new nickname","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","It's going to stick with you, Jack.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial","I hope not. Looking at the G&A, Richard, it picked up a little bit in the quarter. Anything behind that and I guess as an extension of that, is the Atlanta headquarter expense, is that all in the numbers? Is there anything to think about? I think that move is going to take place later this year, anything on the expense side to talk about the ratio moving up a little?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Jack, frankly, G&A came in actually slightly better than our own internal projections and very consistent with the guidance Bob gave in Q4. So, we're making some investments in some IT systems that have been needed. Our common plan management zone infrastructure to help sustain these excellent margins we're posting, we're spending some money there. And there is less than a couple of million bucks in this quarter relative to the headquarters' relocation, so that wasn't a big driver. So again, while the dollar number is clearly higher than the last year, it's well within the guidance range, actually a little bit lower than Bob projected at Q4.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial","Okay, great. I notice the (indiscernible) slide is finally been removed. I agree that issue is largely behind the industry. Can you remind us what the reserve is left after the release and was there anything \u2013 was there any specific communication with the FHFA or was it just more assumption and behavioral patterns that led to the release?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","So at the end of the quarter we'll have $102 million reserve that's after reversing the 19 million. And actually we were able to negotiate a settlement with one significant investor which prompted us to look at this during the quarter and coupled with rising home prices, which certainly reduces the exposure on individual loans. The GSEs have indicated that they are largely through their book. We've seen a decline in the current year in the number of requests \u2013 a significant decline in the number of requests that we're receiving. So on balance we looked at it and felt comfortable to release the reserve. Like we've always said, we will look at it every quarter. If there are things that happened that merit adjusting the reserve, we'll do it. We'll explain it to you when it happens.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. The first question I had was the continued solid execution around the gross margins and you've clearly had a lot of success there. I guess as you look at the common plan management implementation, I guess you're roughly halfway through getting to your long-term goal. I was hoping if you could kind of remind us how you think about how that could incrementally benefit the gross margin from here being, I guess, in a 27%, 28% pre-interest range, if you expect any incremental benefit from here or it would be more just operational and efficiency related perhaps balance sheet inventory turn, et cetera?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Mike, this is Richard. Commonly managed plans definitely have better margins than non-commonly managed plans. So we would expect some benefit from commonly managed plans increasing in the future. Two other points to make; as Bob rightly points out, some of the elements of common plan management such as value engineering and (indiscernible) costing which we've been doing for a while are already embedded in our non-commonly managed plans. So, there's a portion of that benefit that we're not waiting to get. But the biggest point that I'd like to make is that our commonly managed floor plans are better floor plans for the buyers and the absorption rates per home, the take rates from buyers on options and things like that are better, significantly better than our non-commonly managed plans. So, in addition to getting a cost benefit we're getting a revenue benefit. And the combination of those keeps us extremely bullish to push this initiative as fast as we can.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","I appreciate that. I guess it kind of leads to my second question on the absorption rate. I appreciate the additional color, Bob, that you pointed out in terms of the Centex benefit from Texas and Del Webb obviously continuing to perform nicely. As you think about absorptions on a longer term basis, where do you think that can go from here? I think a lot of the industry is \u2013 they're kind of all over the map in terms of where they are relative to history. Some are seeing absorptions back to middle of the past decade, some are still well below that, how are you thinking about that particularly as you're looking at kind of new communities that you expect to come online over the next two to three years?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Mike, Richard again. Listen, it is impossible to predict absorption paces for a community. There is just so many multiple factors that impact things. I will tell you this. I really like the land that we're buying. As a company, the disciplined investment process that we have put in place three years ago now is really benefiting us and obviously we've been focused on return on invested capital more than growth, and I think you're seeing in our numbers some of the benefits of the good land we've been buying. We have really stayed away from any B or C locations. So, how does that translate to absorption paces per community? It's hard to predict. I'll tell you we're pleased with what we delivered in Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS. Your line is open.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank","Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and a great quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Hi, David.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank","I wanted to start and maybe follow up on Mike's question a little bit, and what I want to get an idea of is I think most builders, yourselves included, are using current pace, current price, current cost when they're doing their underwriting. But given your heightened sensitivity to risk in the model and the kind of increased caution around capital allocation and focus on return on capital, I'm wondering how you think about sensitivity analysis, upside down tied especially with the volatility and pace right now, how do you think about that? If you can give us some color and maybe some specificity when it comes to trying to underwrite deals in this market which is such a choppy selling season?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","David, it's a good question and there is no definitive answer to that. What I can tell you is when we see the pro formas that our deal teams put together, we've got an asset management committee here that vets very deal. So the field will go through it and they've put comps together on what pricing is and what paces are going to be and it gets challenged. And so in markets where we have seen rapid run-ups, we actually will tend to, I don't want to say discount that but at least challenge. Is it sustainable? Maybe one of the most important factors around that is what supply is coming online around it. So if you've seen a community that's selling very well and you use that as a comp, well, gosh, is there anybody selling against them, what's going to come to market by the time we get there, it goes a little bit to Mike's question too in terms of we're looking two and three years out typically. So we really do try and flavor that into the expectations of what we can deliver. Again, it's not a \u2013 we're going to apply a 10% discount because they run up. It's more around how do we feel the markets and job creation is going to be there and then what supply do we see in the market?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","David, if I can just add a little color. This is Richard to that. We have a saying internally, stay the course and we've been staying the course and that's probably the most important thing we could do depending on market conditions is not kid ourselves about what's happening, as Bob indicated, and stick to our discipline. And I believe that's helped us continue to do the right thing with land transactions.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank","That's great color and it's actually a good segue to my second question, because Richard you mentioned about the kind of hope that the entry levels is going to come back and trying to be positioned I think and be ready for that move when it does happen and yet the land acquisition is very focused on A locations and not B, C locations. And so I'm just trying to get an idea from a market research perspective how do you think about being ahead of when the entry level does come back. Clearly you have the product in the Centex brand, but from a land perspective, how do you stay ahead of peers and make sure you don't end up chasing those positions?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","David, number one, we're not going to underwrite transactions that don't meet our return criteria and the truth is we haven't found that many that meet our return criteria for the entry level recently. So our goal is to get ahead of it by ensuring we're challenging ourselves on what that buyer wants, how do we deliver tremendous supportability and if credit eases, be able to implement product very quickly that meets those demands. So we do have a strategy team internally that looks at future trends in each of the segments and we're working hard to understand the needs of millennials. Millennials are stretched with student loan debt. Obviously down payments are hard to come by, so I can't give you a lot of specificity on that but I will tell you we're not going to get caught flatfooted if credit eases and not have product and offerings ready to go. The goal is to stay ahead of it. The tough part is, is that going to be a year from now, two years from now, when does that buyer return more meaningfully? We don't know but the point was we'll be ready.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks. First question I wanted to ask was about kind of following up on Dave's question there. Centex brand doing well in Texas, so is that a reflection of first-time buyer demand reemerging maybe locally just in Texas or is that kind of a reflection of the historical positioning that Centex was the Texas brand, so maybe Centex might skew a little bit more \u2013 move up in Texas?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Nishu, I'd say it's a combination of those two things plus a very strong economy in Texas. Texas economy is adding jobs. Houston's the biggest housing market in the country now. I recently did a tour in March to all of our Texas markets and was amazed at the activity going on in all four of the major metro areas with just the overall economy. So I think a combination of strong economy, our legacy position there and an emergence of the entry level category there, but largely fueled because of the strong economy.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG","Got it. And second question, the new EVP positions you highlighted and congratulations to Ryan and Harmon on those. Is that a reflection of the success you've seen with some of your operating strategies, the common floor plans and efficiency in production? So is that kind of a formalization or recognition of that or does that tell us that there are major new directions you're going to pursue and therefore these positions reflect more of that?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Nishu, there are very clearly focused on adding incremental resources to what we've already been pushing, so definitely not signaling anything new. But candidly we've had a very flat structure for the past four or five years and despite all the gains that we have made, we believe there is more to go there. And Harmon and Ryan are exceptional operators that have been very involved in all of the value creation work and delivered great results in their respective geographic areas. So we're bifurcating the roles, if you will, where Harmon can help us focus on pushing each of the field operations to drive out additional benefits and Ryan's role kind of overseeing our homebuilding operations, sales and marketing functions in the company will be derived around capability development to help us further enhance some of the things that we've been working on. So very much staying the course but more horsepower behind it, if you will.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Locker with FBN Securities. Your line is open.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just on your backlog conversion rate going forward, do you expect it similar, say, just in the second quarter to the 53% you guys reported last year?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Joel, this is Richard. We won't give any guidance on that but I'll tell you we don't have many specs, so we have a very healthy backlog, a very strong backlog and it's just a matter of getting those homes delivered but to add to that with incremental specs converting is not going to happen because we don't the specs. So, read into that what you will. We're very, very focused on a bill to order model and it's benefited us in many, many ways, so we're committed to that.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.","Right. And also on your amortized interest that fell I guess around 70 basis points sequentially, I think 440 down to 370. And that kind of got down further faster than I expected and what do you expect going forward to \u2013 I mean you think that level is going to stabilize there, that 370 basis points or do you see maybe up or down going forward?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Yes, we don't give commentary on margins by quarter. What we did indicate is the total expense for the year would be down about $50 million or $55 million from last year. It doesn't come in straight lined during the year, it comes in based on closing volumes. So you'll see a little bit more expense in margin quarters that have higher closing volumes. But again, call it 205-ish million we're thinking for the year in terms of total expense. And to Richard's comment earlier, the activity that we did in the first quarter of this year doesn't move the needle on current year interest. That would be out years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up actually on the management change question. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the structure of Pulte going forward on the homebuilding side as different or distinct from the kind of management structure you had on the homebuilding side sort of pre-crisis, if you will? I know that things have obviously gone through a lot of changes. I imagine you probably learned some lessons and some things you don't want to replicate and I was curious as to what you thought those things were and how we might be able to look at what you're doing today as being consistent [Technical Difficulty]?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","\u2026we think we have a long way to go to kind of push to where our vision is. And then those are kind of the primary responsibilities for Ryan. With regard to Harmon's role, again, very, very focused on having the field operations report to him and digging into all the opportunity areas that I've been able to dig into frankly over the past four years myself. But we still see lots of pockets of opportunity and my role has been fairly broad, and we need to get a little bit more incremental focus on some of the areas to take it to the next level. So all this signals is stay the course with additional very, very well respected and highly qualified individuals to lead these efforts. So relative to the long term \u2013 the past structure that the company has had, I don't think it's all that similar. We still have a very flat structure in the company and we're likely to keep it that way.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital","Okay, great. Well, I'm certainly looking forward to following up there with them. You made a comment about absorptions being up 29% at Centex, the Centex subdivision. I'm very curious about how much of that can be explained by Texas alone or if you were to ex-Texas out, did you still see Centex communities performing better on an absorption basis and are you looking to increase the number of Centex divisions or subdivisions that you're going to be opening up as a result of this? Just trying to understand how you process that outperformance and absorptions at Centex?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","Stephen, as we highlighted, it was \u2013 the largest driver of that was the Texas market where we happened to have a lot of Centex communities. I candidly haven't done it ex-Texas but I would suggest that it was up across the board but I don't know that percentage. We can probably get that for you. In terms of opening new communities, our investment in land has been \u2013 we've talked about 75%, 80% Pulte of the 9,700 lots we put under control in the first quarter, less than 10% of those were Centex lots. So I wouldn't expect a large flood of openings from us, because we just don't have the land to do that. As Richard highlighted, we think if we see whether it's in specific markets or more broadly, a move towards that buyer becoming more active, we think we can get on the lots pretty quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, also, guys.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.","Richard, you all are really the only one in the industry that can move their gross margin significantly from internal things you all are doing at this point. If you look at the external market, what do you think that's giving you right now? It's gotten significantly tougher particularly out west and that type of thing. Has your strategy needed to change any? Do you need to be tighter with pricing or looking forward, I guess, I'm wondering are your incentives going to have to move up at least because of what the markets demanding and that type thing?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Steve, listen, we're not immune to the market vagrancies that happen around the country. So I don't want to imply that our business is not subject to the overall broader trends. I will tell you this, we have shattered some internal assumptions around what can be done in any different component of pricing and frankly cost. And so as a couple of folks prior to you on the call here have indicated, don't underestimate the impact of what the things that we're doing internally can do and we're continuing to work hard on those. So, I would suggest we do have an ability to drive efficiency in our business that's significantly greater than we have in the past. That will be offset some by headwinds. Bob indicated some numbers on pricing and labor costs and what have you that are up. But look, I like where we are. I tell our teams internally we should feel really good about where we are because we've earned our success. We haven't just relied on the market improvement that lifts land values to lift margins like we used to, quite frankly. So, feel good about that with some offset that makes us subject to market conditions. So hope that helps.","Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.","Okay, that does. And then if you look at monthly, you gave some idea of what was going on. As you've looked at this year, has it unfolded \u2013 including into April, has it unfolded from a monthly perspective in a typical fashion? And then you had in prior quarters you had talked about still metering sales, et cetera. I'm guessing based on your performance you didn't \u2013 that's probably starting to dissipate out there if not gone away completely. And along with that on the Del Webb, are you getting \u2013 you've talked about pricing power. You've got the highest margins there. Do you see this as a driver of your margins, the primary driver of your margins moving forward?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","So you snuck in three or four there honestly.","Stephen East - ISI Group Inc.","I did.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","See I caught that. So, listen, a couple of things. With regard to metering paces we are still metering paces in some markets. A good example would be Northern California which is red hot and a few other markets. I think directionally you're right. Probably we're not metering as much as we were but frankly we could have posted more sign-ups in the quarter had we wanted to kind of let it run. But where we already have a six or seven or even eight-month backlog that didn't seem to make a lot of sense for us given the way we're running the business. So, we feel like we're operating the right way. With regard to Del Webb, we're excited about what's happening in Del Webb. As Bob indicated, the overall focus for the company given how much land we have for Del Webb has been very, very positive and I do think that's a positive for us overall. However, I would just point out as Bob indicates, our overall margins are up a similar amount for each of the brands and the reason I highlight that is that's driven outside of market vagrancies. That's driven from common plan management, from focus on discount, from focus on lot premiums. I mean the numbers Bob gave you on options and lot premiums we're very proud of. Those were things we were not paying attention to like we should have four or five years ago. So, hope that helps overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Roxland - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much and congratulations on a very good quarter, especially given the backdrop. Given the slowdown in Arizona, what steps are you taking to address that, if any? And excluding Arizona, how did the Pulte brand do?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","So a couple of comments on Arizona. Arizona is clearly not as strong as it was. But I tell our people given the total volume and margin we're driving out of that market, it's still a very good market. Frankly, I would suggest that our land positions there are very well located. Our teams have done an excellent job. And while we've certainly seen some softer conditions in Arizona, it's not a bad market or one that we're concerned about. We're actually quite happy with our overall performance there. So I'd just point that out. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Michael Roxland - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If you exclude Arizona, how did the Pulte brand itself do?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","As Bob indicated, absorption paces were down. We were hit a little bit with weather conditions in the Midwest, in the Northeast where we have quite a bit of Pulte brand. But we were pleased with our overall efforts on the Pulte brand. I'm sorry, I don't have a specific number for you if we exclude Arizona.","Michael Roxland - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, that's fine. I appreciate all the color. And then just a last question on the community count, obviously it increased to 584 this quarter. I know Bob you mentioned that you're still looking at 560 to 580 for the duration of the year. What occurred during 1Q such that you exceeded your own expectations with respect to key community count? And should we expect really community count growth to be at the higher end of the range that you've indicated in the last couple of quarters?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","No. Again, we still feel comfortable 560 to 580. It's really the vagary of when does a particular community close, when does a particular community open. Again, this isn't a signal of something structurally different in our community count.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Given the success that you're demonstrating in the common plan, I wonder if you consider replacing since you took it out of your put-back side with one that kind of traps your landed vertical costs. And if you would even perhaps comment on that on a year-over-year sequential basis how the land is changing given that you are highlighting other factors like lot premiums, et cetera. But I think the core vertical versus land if you'd comment on your opinion talking about that?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Listen, I appreciate the suggestion. We are trying to do our best to give as much color as we can around that with so many different factors that move the needle, but point taken. We are clearly not relying just on land appreciation to drive our margins. There is a lot of internal effort that's going on there. So, Ken, we'll take that under consideration.","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","It's a very clean way to prove your point. Second, could you comment on Arizona? I think there is obviously a lot of one-off things occurring there. But to the extent there was once a distressed MSA, can you comment why you think that might not be a precursor for what might happen as other distressed markets get more existing inventory back? Florida, obviously, with different foreclosure processes is a very different stage of the game. It's not our view but if you can kind of address why you think it would not be a precursor for inventory pressuring new home sales in other markets? Thank you.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Well, I don't see a lot of excess inventory coming to the market in a lot of places. There was a fairly rapid and focused land grab, if you will, in Phoenix 24 months ago when that market started heating up and a lot of that supply is there today. When we talked to our operators around the system, we don't hear of a lot of inventory coming into the market in any specific market overall. Obviously, it's a function of demand versus supply. But I'm relatively comfortable that we're not going to see a lot of other markets with a lot of supply there. Ken, if I could just reiterate a comment I made a minute ago. Arizona is still a very good market for us. I know a lot of folks have written about the softness in Arizona, so to speak. But I'll go back to something I mentioned earlier on this call. We're buying the right kind of land in the right locations where buyers want to be. And I wouldn't suggest we're immune from the overall vagaries of that market, but we are posting exceptionally strong margins and good sales paces if not phenomenal sales paces like we were 24 months ago. So at least for our business, we're pretty happy with Arizona.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. ","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Hi, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","I wanted to ask you guys, your average order price is up nearly 9% which is terrific and you have actually manageable comps going forward. Do you think that kind of pace is sustainable in the current demand environment going forward for average order prices?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Bob, it's hard to say. You can calculate what kind of a backlog is. It's going to depend a good bit on mix. Bob's comment on Del Webb is going to be important there to the extent that Webb continues to accelerate. That's a positive for us obviously given the ASPs that we drive there. It's hard to predict. I really wouldn't want to comment on that just because who knows exactly what's going to deliver in a given quarter and what the demand environment is going to be. So I don't know, Bob, if you've got any other color of that?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","No, I think that's exactly right.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, understood. One question on the balance sheet. I know you guys have done a great job of managing towards driving return on capital higher and debt to capitalization now is the lowest it's been in a very long time at 28%. You've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet, 1.3 billion. What's the longer view of how you see the balance sheet in two to three years and what do you want to do with the cash? Thanks very much.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","So let me start out and then ask Bob to comment more specifically. I think we have demonstrated that we want to be balanced with our capital. And I wouldn't expect that to change going forward. If you go back, history would say that putting all of our investment into land is not necessarily the best thing for our shareholders. I think we've learned that and you can continue to expect us to be balanced overall and frankly, I think we demonstrated in Q1 all four aspects of capital that we could \u2013 all four aspects of spend we could put our capital toward with increased land spend, obviously a dividend continuing to buyback our own stock as well as repurchase debt. So, I suspect more of the same. I know that's not a lot of specific commentary. Bob, anything else you'd like to mention there?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","No. I think you got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Thanks very much. Was wondering if you can talk about \u2013 you talked about the absorption based on the different brands, that's very helpful. When we think about the strength in Texas and the Centex lower price point and what that means, do you think there's going to be any impact on margins as you move forward from that?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Dan, it's a good question and I'll remind everyone that our main focus is return on invested capital. Obviously, we're happy with our margin focus. But we'll handle it and be happy to underwrite a transaction with a 30% return and an 18% margin as an example. So, it depends on what happens with that category overall. It is a category, generally speaking, that has generally higher turn characteristics and lower margin characteristics. But given what Bob indicated in terms of the overall land investment that we have, I think our results for the next period that we can view are going to be largely driven by what's happening with Pulte and Del Webb. Centex, clearly, is having an impact overall, but I don't know that it will move the needle a whole lot one way or another in the short term.","Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And I guess the other question is just could you provide some great color in terms of the cost per home in terms of the very modest increase there (indiscernible). As you sort of look at the land that's likely to flow through, how do you look at sort of the land cost on a per home basis and what is likely to come through this year?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy","We haven't commented on that historically and I would tell you we highlight that land costs are going up but I think that's true for everybody. What we have highlighted is that margin performance in fiscal '14 will be better than fiscal '13. You saw that in the first quarter. Our margin in Q2 was 18.8 to 20.9. Our backlog visibility would suggest margins closer than what we thought more recently. So I think you'll see improvement there. And Richard just highlighted pricing, so you can I guess backend into the lands done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you. Just wanted to go to a comment you made at the end of your prepared remarks just on April. I think you just said \u2013 at least a little clearly for me, so I just wanted to understand what you were trying to say with April as regards to your optimism for the rest of the spring selling season?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Yes, Eli, what we said was that the traffic levels are slightly down from what we saw in March and we said that's the normal seasonal trend where we typically see traffic peak in March and then trail off a little bit through the rest of the selling season. So we said \u2013 our comment was we are seeing a normal spring selling season unfold which leaves us optimistic for the balance of the year. That's what we said.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Great. And then just one quick one. What was the comp rate in the quarter?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr.","Just under half.","Robert T.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions].","I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead Sir.","Jim Zeumer","Thank you, James and good morning. I want to welcome participants to this morning's call to discuss PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter 2019 operating and financial results. I'm joined this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today.","I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported results today as well as results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release, within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results.","Before I turn the call over to Ryan, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes board looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect our results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Jim and good morning. As detailed in this morning's press release. PulteGroup's fourth quarter results closed out 2019 on a high note, which I believe positions the company for even greater successes in the year ahead. Our outstanding Q4 results reflect the strength of our overall market positions and homebuilding operations in combination with an ongoing acceleration and fundamental housing demand. What have you is particularly encouraging is the broad base strength of the housing market.","As our Q4 order rates were higher across each of our geographic areas, and across each of the buyer groups we serve. Reflective of this strength and demand traffic to our stores was up 14% over the prior year, while order rates increased 33%. Housing continues to benefit from favorable market dynamics including strong employment, consumer confidence and demographic numbers, which have underpinned demand for the last several years. I think improved affordability across many markets is now adding incremental support and allowing more consumers to get actively engaged in the home buying process.","While the slow start to 2019 resulted in our full year closings and revenues being up only slightly over last year, we still deliver increased earnings per share, generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. And that's after having invested $3 billion into the business. And we also returned almost $400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We were also successful in strengthening our financial position, having retired $274 million of our bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2021, with this helping us to enter the New Year with a net debt to cap of only 21.7%. Couple all of this with our highest ending backlog in over a decade. And I think it's clear that we're extremely well positioned to grow the business and deliver even greater financial results in 2020.","While I am excited to speak with you this morning about this morning's announced acquisition of Innovative Construction Group, I'm first going to turn the call over to Bob so he can finish reviewing our financial results. Bob?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Thank you and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup's order volume and absorption rate were the highest we have generated in the fourth quarter in more than a decade. For the period net new orders totaled 5,691 homes, which is an increase of 33% over the prior year.","As Ryan indicated, we experienced strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups. For the quarter, our first time buyer orders increased 57% to 1,743 homes; move-up orders increased 27% to 2,471 homes, while active adult orders increased 22% to 1,477 homes.","In the quarter we operated from an average of 865 communities, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year community count of 825. Adjusting for community counts absorption pace was up 27% over last year. Consistent with our orders we realized higher absorption rates across our entire portfolio as absorptions increased 38% among first time buyers, 29% among move-up buyers and 10% among active adult buyers.","The improved operating environment contributed to the company's strong financial performance in the quarter, as home sale revenues increased to $2.9 billion. Higher revenues in the period were driven by a 2% increase in closings to 6,822 homes, as our average sales price was down less than 1% to $429,000.","Our average sale price for the period reflects a combination of pricing dynamics and mix just realized in the period. More specifically, our average sales price for move-up and active adult closings increased 4% to $494,000 and $423,000 respectively, while pricing for first time homes decreased by 8% to $342,000. It's worth noting that the decrease in first time ASP reflects the ongoing and purposeful expansion of our entry level business, particularly in the southeast Florida and Texas.","This successful expansion of our first time business is also demonstrated in the mix of our fourth quarter closings. By buyer group closings in the quarter were comprised of 32% first time, 45% move-up and 23% active adult, as compared with 26% first time, 47% move-up and 27% active adult in the fourth quarter last year.","These results include the closing of 432 more first time homes this quarter from the fourth quarter last year. Given the increased investment we have been making an asset that serve this buyer group, we believe we are well positioned to continue expanding this element of our business.","The strong order environment has also contributed to a 20% increase in our backlog over the same period last year to 10,507 homes. As a result, we've been increasing our production such that we had 10,780 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, which is up 14% over last year. Of the homes under production 69% are sold, while the remaining 31% are spec.","On a percentage basis spec production down from last year, but up sequentially. This largely reflects the introduction of incremental spec units on our entry level communities as we seek production efficiencies, and to meet the moving ready expectations of that buyer group.","Given the homes we have under contract and introduction, we expect first quarter deliveries to be in the range of 5,300 to 5,500 homes. At the midpoint this would represent an increase of 17% over the first quarter of 2019. With this strong start to the year, we expect full year deliveries to be in the range of 25,500 to 26,250 homes in 2020.","Based on the relative strength of our first time communities, we expect the average sales price of closing through the first quarter will be in the range of $410,000 to $415,000, with full year ASP in the range of $415,000 to $420,000.","Continuing down the income statement, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was 22.8%, compared with prior year reported and adjusted gross margin of 21.5% and 23.8% respectively.","Our gross margin for the quarter came in lower than our previous guidance due to a number of factors. Notably, we delivered more homes than we expected in California, where pricing was under pressure much of the year.","In addition, we realized higher than expected warranty costs at a limited number of previously closed communities and we recorded a couple of minor inventory impairments. Well, none of these items were individually significant. Together they did act as a margin drag in the period.","Demonstrating the real ongoing strength of our business, we expect our first quarter gross margin to increase sequentially and to be in the range of 23.0% to 23.3%. In fact, the potential is there for margins to improve further as the year progresses. And we currently expect full year gross margins to be in the range of 23.0% to 23.4%.","Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $262 million, or 8.9% of home sale revenues included a $31 million pre-tax benefit from an insurance reserve adjusted recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit our adjusted SG&A expense was $293 million or 10% of home sale revenues.","SG&A expense for the prior year fourth quarter was $292 million or 10.1% of home sale revenues. With expectations for higher closing volumes in 2020, we believe we can realize incremental overhead leverage. As such we expect SG&A expense for 2020 to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9% of home sale revenues.","Our financial services operations generated fourth quarter pre-tax income of $34 million, compared with $5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Last year's results included a charge of $16 million for a reserve adjustment recorded in the period.","This year's improved financial performance also benefited from a strong margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in our home building operations as well as a higher capture rate. In fact, our mortgage capture rate increased to 84% from 77% last year.","In the fourth quarter our income tax expense was $100 million for an effective tax rate of 23% compared with $92 million for an effective tax rate of 27.9% last year. Our fourth quarter rate was lower than our previous guide as we benefited from an adjustment in evaluation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets, as well as the benefit related to the recent approval of the energy tax credit. Looking ahead for 2020, we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.","In total, are reported net income was $336 million or $1.22 per share in the quarter. On an adjusted basis our net income for the quarter was $312 million or $1.14 per share. In the prior year our reported net income in the fourth quarter was $238 million or $0.84 per share while well adjusted net income was $314 million or $1.11 per share.","Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was calculated using approximately 271 million shares, which is down 9 million shares or roughly 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our lower share count is due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase activities.","During the fourth quarter, we invested $771 million in land acquisition and development spend bringing our total land spend for 2019 to $3 billion. We ended the year with approximately 158,000 lots under control, with 41% of them held via option. Looking to 2020, we expect our total land spend to increase to approximately $3.2 billion.","Given our existing land pipeline, we expect full year 2020 community count growth of 1% to 3% over 2019. Growth will be closer to 3% to 5% in the first quarter of the year, reflecting the benefit of last year's American West acquisition.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 765,000 common shares for $30 million for an average price of $39.16 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $274 million for an average price of $32.52 per share.","After all this activity, we ended 2019 with $1.2 billion of cash and as Ryan mentioned a net debt to capital ratio of 21.7%. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio is 33.6%, which is down 500 basis points from last year.","Let me now turn the call back to Ryan for some additional comments. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Bob. Consistent with the 33% increase in orders, the demand environment in the fourth quarter was obviously much stronger than last year. We saw generally strong demand in the eastern third of the country with Florida continuing to deliver exceptional performance. Demand in our Midwest and Texas operations was also much improved with our Texas business in particular, benefiting from increased business among first time buyers.","Demand out west was certainly much stronger in the quarter and I would cautiously highlight that Northern California appears to be finding its footing after a tough 12 plus months. Strong fourth quarter demand, which has continued into the first few weeks of January, has us heading into 2020 with much higher expectations than we had at this time last year. We're optimistic that a good macroeconomic backdrop and better affordability should keep buyer interest high in the year ahead.","Now, with the review of our operating and financial results Complete, I want to discuss PulteGroup's acquisition of Innovative Construction Group or ICG. For several years, you've heard the construction industry talk about a tight labor market and how this is adding to our construction costs and cycle times. Given these conditions, you've also heard us discuss efforts to expand the use of offsite manufacturing in our construction operations. As we launched our commonly managed plan platform in 2011 to better standardize our product offering and simplify our purchasing and construction processes.","In 2019, 81% of our closings were from our common plan portfolio. With the success of this platform, we have viewed capturing the benefits of offsite manufacturing as a next logical step. Over the last 18 months, we've met with numerous businesses that are working to bring increased automation to homebuilding. It is through this work that we identified ICG which provides framing solutions to residential and commercial contractors in and around the Jacksonville market. ICG's offsite solution includes offering design services, manufacturing wall panels, roof trusses and floor systems and onsite installation to provide a full frame shell construction process.","In evaluating ICG, we were very impressed by the management team, along with the product quality, production efficiency and overall innovation of the plant's operations. Working closely with the company founders, who will continue to lead ICG going forward, we plan to extend the use of preassembled floor systems and to expand the factories production capabilities to include installed windows, and wall prep for mechanical, electrical and plumbing. ICG will remain a standalone operation and continue serving its existing customer base and build their clients. This acquisition has the potential to benefit our Jacksonville operations through faster cycle times, precision structural components and savings on lumber and other materials.","More importantly, we see this facility as a model for integrating increased offsite production in other PulteGroup divisions. While likely a few years down the road, the opportunity is there to develop comparable production plants in areas where scale and adjacent markets can support a dedicated factory. It is important to note that ICG is just one component of our strategy, as we do continue to partner with key suppliers to move more of our production into a factory setting. This is one plant serving one market, but we're greatly encouraged by the potential offsite production offers to enhance our operations in North Florida today and other markets in the future.","We see the opportunity to produce high quality components with greater efficiency, while allowing PulteGroup to work more effectively with its trade partners. We look forward to providing updates on this venture and related activities as they develop. Before opening the call to questions, I want to welcome the employees of ICG into the PulteGroup family and thank our entire team for their outstanding work in 2019. Thanks to your efforts, the company is operationally and financially strong, and we head into 2020 with tremendous momentum.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.","Jim Zeumer","Okay, thanks, Ryan. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. James you explain the process again. We'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks, good morning, everyone. The first question I had was just on the drivers of the gross margin for 2020 and expecting a little bit of improvement. I was hoping you can break down how you're thinking about the different components of that \u2013 those drivers by either mix, pricing, costs, cost inflation what are the bigger drivers there?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah, Mike, it's Bob. Obviously when we look at the business and how we want to project our margins going forward, the first start we've placed \u2013 the first place we start is our backlog. We've got a strong backlog coming into the year. So we know that pricing embedded in that. We think about how the business has performed largely over the last three months, as we've built that backlog. And so as an example, California, we've seen pricing get a little bit firmer out there, we've seen a little bit more volume. And so I guess, as simply as I could say, it's based on what we see in our backlog. We're not assuming price appreciation. I can tell you that as we look at vertical construction costs in fiscal '20, we see about a 1% increase. So relatively modest inflation, a lot of costs are obviously going to get a little more expensive as we move more recent into the surface of the portfolio. But again, that's all factored in, but we're not doing price appreciation in that guide.","Michael Rehaut","Okay, appreciate it. I guess for my second question and I apologize, I was pulled away for a moment during some of the prepared remarks. The ICG acquisition, I was curious about that in terms of the rationale and again, I apologize if you kind of addressed this already, but just the rationale behind buying the company outright versus being a customer as is and reaping the benefits of the efficiencies of the business or the business relationship simply as a customer or perhaps making an equity investment to allow the company to grow further without fully consolidating it and kind of adding an additional cost structure so to speak onto your own book.","Ryan Marshall","Hey, Mike, it's Ryan and good morning. Thanks for the question. I think as we looked at \u2013 the way I'd explain that as we looked at ICG, I think there were a number of different ways that we potentially could have reaped some of the benefits associated with the offsite manufacturing. You highlighted a number of those. We elected to go the route that we did for a number of reasons, which I probably won't get into on this call. What I will tell you is the path that we've chosen to take on this particular acquisition was right for this particular opportunity. Where we're going to is as we look at our entire operation across the country, continue to leverage relationships with other suppliers where we're looking to move as much of our production into automated type factory settings as we can. And in many of those cases, it will be with existing suppliers that are bringing technology to the table. We are going to use the learnings from this point to certainly enhance right away our Jacksonville operations. And we'll use those learnings down the road to potentially look at standing up new plants of our own, where we have the right amount of volume to support those. So we're really excited about what this does. It's been a journey, frankly, in the making since 2011, when we started our commonly managed plan portfolio. And this is the next logical step. So more to come, but suffice it to say we're pretty excited about what this opportunity holds for the industry.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yeah, thanks a lot guys. Let me follow on Mike's question here on ICG. I have a number of questions maybe you can just say to take them all as one. I'm curious about your longer term plans, there's opportunity to expand? Are you thinking that it's going to be more along the lines of these integrated systems, with the mechanicals, integrated and windows or it would more kind of like the raw \u2013 the bare skeleton as you think about the opportunities? And can you give us a sense for the \u2013 an estimate of how much you think that you're saving? Or they are saving in the Jacksonville market, and whether you think that that's something which can increase as you take this across the country","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, Stephen, I'll take the first question, as far as where we see this going in the future, and I think it's really the later or the first piece that you mentioned, which is to take it to the level of plumbing, electrical, window installation, et cetera. So I think Even an advanced level of manufacturing, from what's readily available, I think in most markets today with just the raw frame shell. So ICG is already starting to do some floor cassettes, which we think is kind of in that more advanced level offsite manufacturing. And as we look to this existing operation plus the places down the road, we think the real opportunity is to get into the more advanced manufacturing. We're certainly going to get benefits today from kind of the frame shell components of walls and trusses. But where we really see the benefit coming is in those more advanced manufacturing techniques. In terms of kind of the benefits, Stephen, we certainly believe that there's benefit there. I would highlight for you that this is a kind of single plant in a single market, so any impact in our overall reported results I think will be modest. But it's a big step for the company and a journey that we're really excited to take over the next two or three years.","Stephen Kim","Excellent, well, I know you guys have done a tremendous amount of work there. So I've been probably one of the best positions to know. Second question relates to the entry level segment of the market. We highlighted this morning that there were some changes done with respect to housing policy or at least changes that look like they're coming which could be helpful to the lower end of the market, even beyond what we've seen over the last couple of years. I'm curious as to whether or not you have seen any change in the entry level of the market. We know that there's been a lot of other folks moving into that segment of the market in a more serious way and I was curious Whether or not you have continued to see strength at the entry level, or if you've seen it start to moderate in any way. So just your commentary about what you're seeing in the marketplace from a \u2013 at the lower end of the market.","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, Stephen, it's Ryan, I'll take the first piece of that. We are seeing continued strength and I think it's evidenced in our reported numbers for the fourth quarter on our first time entry level space. We had 57% year-over-year signup growth, which is pretty robust. So we're excited about that. We're excited about the continued investment that we've been making over the really the last two and a half years to meaningfully move the number of lots that we control that are specifically targeted to this first time space and so I like how our position there. Some of the changes that you speak to I think have certainly helped with the overall affordability equation in providing attractive and accessible financing to even more buyers. And I think that is all factored into the overall demand situation that we're seeing from the first time entry level buyer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the move-up business, obviously strong absorption growth there as well in the quarter. And obviously many are your competitors leaning harder and into the entry level. So I guess on move-up how do you think about at this point Pulte's position competitively, both in terms of land acquisition and potentially even pricing power at move-up communities just because simply you don't quite hear as much about your competitors leaning into that part of the business as much. Thank you.","Ryan Marshall","Matt, it's a good question and I think it highlights the reason or maybe gives me an opportunity to reiterate the balanced mix and the balanced approach that we've \u2013 that we have tried to take with our business. And if I take you back to kind of late 2016, where we started talking about was an opportunity to shift about five points of our business out of move-up and into entry level. And you're starting to see the results in our closed home mix from that effort. What that yields. Just to give you some specific numbers, in the fourth quarter 43% of our signups were from our move-up business. So it continues to be the largest piece of our business. It's a very profitable piece of our business and it carries kind of our flagship brand of Pulte Homes. So we like our position. We have not abandoned it at all. Rather, I think we've more appropriately shaped the size of that business to be reflective of the market opportunity. We think we've also \u2013 the counterbalance to that is that we think we've gotten better position to take advantage of the first time opportunity as well. Suffice it to say, we don't have all of eggs in any one single basket and we like that.","Matthew Bouley","Okay, appreciate that color. And then secondly, I wanted to ask on the SG&A side. You're guiding to relatively flat leverage in 2020, maybe slight leverage of the midpoint. But obviously, you are set up well from a backlog standpoint around revenue growth. I guess, just are there any other expenses? There were some of the IT spending you were talking about last quarter, that we should be aware of that might prevent some of the kind of additional SG&A leverage. Thank you,","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah, Matt, it's Bob. We \u2013 obviously, when you adjust for the current year, we come in around 10.8%. So the range that we've given shows some \u2013 even at the midpoint some improvement over that. Certainly we've talked about over the last couple of years that we've been on a journey on the IT side, the upgrades of our systems, as those systems get put in place, we're actually starting to depreciate them now. So we've got some costs associated with that, so really nothing new or unusual in that. It's really just being able to leverage the increased scale of the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi, great, thanks for taking my questions. First one are to start with a question around kind of pricing power and the momentum and gross margins. I think Bob you talk about the potential for margins to improve as the year goes on. I'm not sure if that was still within the construct of the full year guidance that you're giving or suggesting that there could be upside from there. But as a starting point, could you talk about just the pricing power that you've seen? Maybe if you can give kind of percentage of communities that you've been able to raise price, any sense of magnitude and how that compares year-on-year over the past few months?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah. Hey, Mike, just to clarify, that improvement was included in the guide, not outside the guide. So that's just reflecting that the range for the year actually goes a little bit higher than what we prepared for the first quarter. In terms of pricing power, I think if you look at our ASP, during the quarter, it's roughly flat on an aggregate basis. But you've actually got a decrease in the entry level, which is really a reflection of the types of assets we're providing there. There's actually \u2013 if there's any pricing, real pricing power in the market, I think it's there and I think it has been for probably the last year or two. We showed about 4% up on the move-up and active adult, so I think there isn't a real substantive change in the product we're delivering. But I think that gives you some insight into what the pricing power is around that mix always matters where the markets, it comes from all that. But on balance, I would say you've got more power to price in the entry level, although they are price sensitive. So there's a limit to how far you can push that. But we're seeing prices holding go up a little bit in the balance of the business.","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, and Mike, the only other thing that I'd add to that is I think with the strength that you're seeing on the volume side, and we're starting to see some reduced inventory levels. I think certainly that would create an environment where all of the builders will have more pricing power. The thing that I think you'll see certainly us and all builders be cautious with is the affordability equation. We all saw what happened kind of in the back half of '18 when affordability became challenged and so pricing is one of the key levers in that mix, and I think we'll want to pay attention to that.","Mike Dahl","Okay, thanks for that. And second question. Just another follow up on ICG and, Ryan, I appreciate that there are some things that you don't want to get into in terms of the details, but did want to press again on just \u2013 since you'll continue to have ICG serve its external customer base, what is the true differentiation to Pulte of owning the assets? Is it just the first hand learnings you've discussed or was this maybe more of a situation where you were an existing customer and had you not taken this position you could have lost access to them as a supplier or any other dynamic at play that could just kind of explain why this ends up being differentiating for you versus as others have question just having this be more of a partnership, but still a traditional kind of customer relationship.","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, I think the opportunity here, Mike is really twofold. Number one, we see it as a great opportunity to partner with the founders to speed up the innovation moving from the current version of frame shell into some of the more advanced manufacturing techniques. So that's something that we've been talking about, you've heard us talk about really for the last two or so years that we think there's a tremendous opportunity there. And then the other piece is with 80% of our closings coming out of our commonly managed plant portfolio. We see this opportunity really applying to other parts of our business besides just you know what it's going to provide in the North Florida market. So that's something that we think working with the founders of ICG we can really benefit from and other parts of the country. The biggest reason Mike and I can't overemphasize this enough, this is about labor. We have been talking about labor shortages in this industry for the last 10 years, give or take. There doesn't seem to be anything that's going to structurally change the availability of labor. And so the only logical off ramp that we see to that is getting more efficient. And one of the avenues that we think is the easiest \u2013 or the most easily accessible off ramp is to truly have a housing operation that can benefit from offsite production. And we see the unlock that it gives us on the tight labor supplies as a huge benefit.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one on ICG and I think this is an incredible opportunity. And frankly, we see this is the future of home building. So I think this is an excellent move on your part. But ICG looks like they have the ability to deliver a complete fully integrated offsite solution. I mean, building information modeling, component manufacturing, installations, et cetera. And it looks like that you're taking kind of more of a piecemeal approach here just to start with some more prefab parts instead of going for the full solution. So I guess the question is, is this just being a little bit conservative on the onsite here and how quickly could you kind of pivot in the Jacksonville market to really deliver a fully integrated off site solution.","Ryan Marshall","Hey, John, it's Ryan. We haven't given that level of detail yet. But I think what you highlight is what the real opportunity is. And that's certainly what we're focused on. As I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, the level of innovation that it was \u2013 that was existing inside of ICG is one of the things that made it really attractive. So to your point, they have design services, or manufacturing precision components, we've got the ability to assemble those precision components with the onsite labor. And so the next logical step is some incremental investment. And then to kind of systematize in a way that you can do it in a volume type setting. And so, that's what the opportunity is and certainly what we're squarely focused on.","John Lovallo","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just more of a housekeeping item here, the gross margin in the quarter, I think you guys had highlighted California incentives, warranty in inventory impairments. Anywhere you can kind of bucket the impact in the quarter from each of those?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah, I wouldn't, because none of them are individually significant. If we get, they were we would have walked it through them. I would characterize the total of it as being somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 basis points of margin impact on the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner","Hey, guys, good morning. Nice quarter and congrats on the acquisition.","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Alan.","Alan Ratner","My first one on ICG, just hearing your comments about some of the things that were the future where you can see this going and especially the closed panels with the windows and the plumbing and the electrical et cetera already pre-installed. One thing that we typically hear from builders is a reason why perhaps that hasn't become more main stream is the very high transportation costs associated with that bringing those products to the job site as well as breakage. I mean, I know builders even back in the 80s and 90s were experimenting with that stuff, installing windows and things. So is there anything that ICG has done that kind of is cracked the code to make that process more efficient and affordable from a building perspective that the math actually makes sense now, or is that just something that you think you've got the right team in place to pursue that, but perhaps they're not quite there yet?","Ryan Marshall","Yeah. Alan thanks for the question. I appreciate it. As we mentioned today, what's coming out of ICG are the wall panels, the floor cassettes, and manufacturer trusses, we think there's an opportunity to go to the closed wall panels inclusive of windows, electrical, plumbing, et cetera. Work and investment has got to be done on that. I think you highlight the challenge that applies to all off site manufacturing not just kind of this second stage and its transportation. And so what that means is that you've got to have enough volume within a relatively close proximity such that the transportation costs don't offset the savings that you get from building those components in a more efficient way. So work to be done, investment to be done to figure that out, it has been done in other places in other applications. And so we think that the ability to do it is there. And then I think the next logical question is, well, why is this time going to be different? And it goes back to the question that I answered a few back which is labor and we just don't see labor rates going in a direction that will challenge the efficiencies that are gained from the manufacturing environment, which has happened in the past, but because of what I think is going to be a persistent shortage of labor, we really view this as a as a new opportunity to do something different.","Alan Ratner","Got it, that's helpful, Ryan and second question, maybe for Bob, I'm just kind of thinking about the capital allocation, thinking at this point here. Your net debt to cap is at the lowest level we've seen in many years. And at the same time buybacks decelerated this quarter and for the year we're down fairly meaningfully from the prior few years. So how are you thinking about the balance sheet, the capital allocation at this point? Is there another kind of use of that cash that's being earmarked at this point? Or is it a function of where the stock prices and any commentary you can give there?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah, it's going to sound a little bit redundant and boring, but it's kind of the same playbook we've been working from for the last several years. We pulled every lever this year, we bought stock, we increased our dividend, we retired some debt, we've invested in the business, we've indicated we'll be investing more this year, obviously, we've got an investment we just made an ICG and I think you'll continue to see all of those things be in our windshield. We obviously expect pretty strong cash generation in fiscal '20. What we've highlighted and been consistent with I think is we'll report the news on the share repurchase activity. But I think any and all of those are still front of mine, but nothing new or different to report beyond that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko","Hi, good morning. First one, a little bit bigger picture for Ryan, thinking about this pivot for the entry level, and it seems this may be occurring a little bit faster than maybe you'd expected the success or the uptick. On the entry level side, you've got a real gamut of competition, you've got bare bones product, you've got everything included on the other end and then somewhere between you've got build order curious how you see Pulte really positioning and competing an entry level or product standpoint, as that business gets to be a bigger part of your mix?","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, good morning, Jack. I appreciate the question. You're going to see us play on the higher end of the entry level price point. We have made some modifications to our typical built to order model and you heard that in Bob's prepared comments that we are building more specs in that business, to kind of meet the demand. That's there and so you saw a little bit of an uptick in our specs as a percentage of total inventory. And it's largely reflective of more specs in that entry level business. We are limiting the choice within our Centex model to drive some of the efficiencies that were in turn passing on to the consumer which really creates the affordability in the value that this first time buyer desire. So less choice, less ability to customize, but you're getting a really nice home and a lot of home for the money. And we think that's where the magic is. We'll continue to deliver the great customer experience, the high quality, the quality location of communities and I think all of our brands have been known for. I don't think you'll \u2013 well you won't see us probably go with the bare bones model the really small square footage model we just don't think that's part of the offering that we give to the consumer.","Jack Micenko","Okay, thanks for that. And then the five points of pivot, given the uptick that you've seen and I think last quarter, you said that the margins in the entry were healthy or perhaps the move does that five point number expand? Are you leaving the door open for that to expand or you can say hey, look at we want to be a balanced business? And a third of the book is all we really want on the entry side.","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, Jack. I think that the key message that I'd emphasize is we want a balanced business. I think you'll see it maybe it may go down a few points, it may go up a few points as opportunities arise. Our overall focus is going to continue to be the drive through cycle return on investment within the residential housing space. And so as we see trends emerge, we'll certainly take opportunities where they present themselves. But with the focus on being more balanced,","I don't think you're going to see us place outsized bets in anticipation of some future trend. So we're pretty close to probably where we want to be, is probably the message that I leave with you. And as far as margins go to your other question, we like the margin profile that we're getting out of the entry level space. They're attractive margins. And it's really reflective of what Bob shared, which is, that's the place where we've seen the ability to get some price expansion. What I would emphasize Jack to the comment I made a minute ago about our focuses on return. We really look at the underwriting that business is the same as we look at move-up and the same as we look at active adult. So certainly gross margins are part of the story, but the real prize is return on invested capital. And we look at all of our consumer segments the same when it comes to return.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen. So your entry level, few years ago people were so concerned around the Del Webb, you seem to be putting that to rest. My question is this, if you're moving in entry, because that's where demand is, it makes sense. You're building more spec homes. Why is that approach given your hesitancy to do it in other categories? What is the risk return that you're seeing there? Is it because you're controlling more labor like some other builders have talked to? Is it that \u2013 what is it that gets you over that risk profile that you have for your other categories in short?","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, Ken its Ryan. Risk is just part of it. It's really about value in the eyes of the consumer. And so as we've looked at what the consumers willing to pay for, we believe that we're more efficient, more profitable, and manage risk better with the move-up and active adult buyer when they get the opportunity to choose the things that they value. And that's part of our strategic pricing model that is contributed to the margin profile that we have today that we're very proud of. We think with this entry level consumer, they value different things and affordability and access is probably the biggest driver. And so by limiting the amount of choice that we give, building a few more specs, having those homes quicker to deliver because this buyer in theory is coming out of an apartment. They just operate on a little bit different buying cycle than our move-up and our active adult buyer. And so it's less about risk and more about maximizing value and giving the consumer the things that they want and need.","Ken Zener","I understand and think it's a good move. Second question, could you expand a little bit since you mentioned it as a gross margin drag California? Could you just talk about it being north south, coastal inland et cetera? Just give us your perspective since that was something you called out specifically. Thank you very much.","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, Ken I think California as a whole it's been \u2013 the secret has been a drag and it's had \u2013 it's been a tougher selling environment for really the last 12 months, south and north, coastal and inland. In order of severity, I think northern California coastal probably being the hardest hit and the slowest. It also happens to be the place where we're starting to see some strength start to come back into the market. And so we're cautiously optimistic as we've got a very strong business or a nicely positioned business in Northern California in the Bay Area in particular. So probably the drag more on discounts and incentives that had to be \u2013 that were given to continue to sell homes in Northern California or the last 12 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to follow up on the move-up market, get a little bit more color on that. Our field research recently has revealed a healthy move-up market, which I'll just say has been ahead of our expectations, quite frankly. But what do you really think is driving that? Is it lower rates kind of breaking up the prior rate lock? Are you starting to see the leading edge in the millennials purchase in earnest in the move up market? Really what do you think is driving that improvement?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah, I think like everything else, it is the health of the economy, first and foremost, so you've got wage inflation, you have relatively slower price appreciation, there's \u2013 rate certainly helps if it's benefiting, so all those things coupled together. One of the earlier questions talked about sort of the big move for a lot of the builders to the entry level, which has to a degree than doubt, the competitive set. So supply is in pretty good shape, both from a new build perspective and we've got a healthy supply in just about every market where we're operating today in terms of days on market for resale, which is our biggest competitor. So I think all those things together have lent themselves to a pretty nice business for us at 29% absorption increase, 4% price appreciation is pretty nice. So we like the business and I'll parent what Ryan said earlier, it's the reason we're not making a big bet one way or the other. We think through time being able to serve in each of the markets where we operate that of consumers that are there and it's going to be different, for instance, in some parts of Florida than what it is in some parts of the Midwest, right, so that \u2013 we're looking at each market and investing to serve a balanced portfolio in the market where we're operating.","Truman Patterson","Okay, okay. Absolutely agree with that. On the cost inflation outlook for 2020, I know you guys mentioned 1% stick and brick was likely to occur what you were expecting? Could you just break up your outlook for land, labor and materials? And whether or not you think this accelerates versus 2019?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yeah, it's interesting. On the land side it's a competitive market. You've heard us say this before, it always is. I think you'll see certain parts of the country and certain asset classes being more competitive than others. But I think we're going to see continued land pressure. We see it in the land coming through and closing today. And I don't think land is on sale. In terms of the labor and materials, on the material side we've got a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year. reflective of the decreasing price of lumber and the lumber package in the back half of last year which will affect our closings now. But we've seen lumber tick up a little bit not bad, but a little bit so we think that'll moderate through the year. All the other real \u2013 other than concrete, which is always local to a market, we see a pretty benign material inflation rate. Labor is as you've heard us talk about and the reason for the ICG investment, always a little bit of a wild card. It's been better the last 12 months and so our expectation is that we don't see a lot of pressure on labor rate. That's going to vary by market. But obviously, we think about 1% up overall. Once again, that's going to largely be labor, just given the way that the materials market is behaving.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks. Good morning guys. Jack and Truman got a couple of miles, so I just have one for you. With move-up looking better first time mix has moved that way the old cruise ship Del Webb stuff has kind of come off. I'm curious what you're thinking about inventory turns next couple of three years, how important that metric is to you? You turn about your image throughout one time of year by my numbers. Are you expecting that to pick up meaningfully? And how important is that metric to you all as a driver of return?","Ryan Marshall","Yeah, Carl, look it's a big driver of return. And so I think the way that we look at inventory turns is breaking down what do you get on the house side and what do we get on the land side, with 80 some odd percent of our balance sheet being in land, that's the lever that can really move the needle on overall inventory turns. And it's a big reason why you've heard us talk about doing shorter duration land deals with more options because it drives right at the heart of the inventory turns equation. So the hope would be that we can continue to grow that, as we roll in more options as we roll off some of the cruise ship Del Webb's that you mentioned we'd look for opportunity to accelerate our land inventory turn. On the house side, that's a balance between really cycle time, how much labor is available and delivering a high quality product. And I think it's another reason why we've made the investment in ICG, is because it speaks to all of those. You've got an opportunity to build with more precise components that are sitting out in the rain and the snow. You've got the ability of the BIM modeling and some of the technology that factors into that. And we think we can cut cycle time as well. So we think there's an opportunity to kind of pull all the levers there with more efficient labor, higher quality materials, being more cost efficient. So we think there's a lot of goodness.","Carl Reichardt","We'd appreciate that, Ryan. Thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the questions \u2013 the time for questions that we have today. So I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Zeumer for some closing remarks.","Jim Zeumer","Great, we appreciate everybody's time this morning. We're certainly available over the remainder of the day for any follow up questions and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir.","James Zeumer","Great. Thank you, David, and good morning. I apologize if there's been some confusion on the dial-in numbers but hopefully we've got everybody in. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's call, which is to review PulteGroup's third quarter earnings. I'm joined on the call this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance.","A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post a copy of today -- a replay of today's call to our website a little later on. Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.","The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss PulteGroup's strong third quarter results and the operating and financial gains we continue to realize. Given a quarter in which our revenues grew by 25%, our operating margin gained 190 basis points and our earnings per share increased 74%.","I would typically focus my opening comments on the strength of our Q3 numbers. But when housing stocks drop over 20% during that same period, it may be more useful to start with the review of market conditions as this seems to be an area of focus for our investors. Based on industry dynamics, we maintain our positive view on the housing market and the overall sustainability of the current housing recovery. We fully appreciate, however, that operating conditions have changed over the past several months. We continue to actively assess the impact of rising interest rates and are making adjustments on a community-by-community basis to manage pace and price to achieve appropriate returns. That being said, let me provide a few high-level data points to consider, as it may provide some additional insight on what's happening in the market.","Buyer traffic into our communities in Q3 was up 15% over last year, and the year-over-year gains accelerated as we moved through the quarter. To us, the increasing volume of consumer traffic indicates that homebuying interest remains high. While traffic into our communities was up in the quarter, company-wide absorption pace was down. These data points, along with the feedback from our sales teams, suggest that affordability may be becoming a bigger hurdle for potential buyers to overcome. For some buyers the problem may be an inability to qualify for a mortgage. For other buyers the bigger difficulty may be wondering if now is still a good time to buy or even questioning the perceived value of a new home, especially if the purchase requires giving up an exceptionally low mortgage rate they locked in a few years ago. Whether the hurdles are real or perceived the resulting impact was that the conversion rate of prospect to contract signing was down in Q3. We had talked about this lower conversion rate on our last earnings call and how it started to slow when mortgage rates begin ticking up in May. It certainly isn't new news that home prices have been marching higher, almost since this recovery started in 2011 and even accelerated in response to rising costs over the past year.","Now layering on top of elevated home prices is a rise in mortgage rates, which are up roughly 50 basis points over the past six months. This combination of high income -- high home prices and more expensive financing has created a bit of sticker shock, while making it harder for some buyers to achieve their desired monthly payment.","Market conditions may be more competitive but the key underpinnings of the business remain positive. Supporting the demand side is GDP growth, exceeding 3%, low unemployment, high consumer confidence and wage growth. We also believe that the industry continues to under build relative to demand. This is helping keep supply in check as evidenced by the fact that there's less than four months of inventory of new and existing homes on the market.","Looking at today's overall market dynamics, we see an environment where housing can continue along the gradual growth trajectory it's been on for the past seven years. Buyer interest remains high, inventories remain low with land and labor constraints helping to reduce the risk of overbuilding. Higher rates and affordability concerns may be issues, but some combination of adjustments in price and\/or income or simply even just the passage of time should help consumers to get over these hurdles. In what we view as a good operating environment, but one that is arguably more challenging than 6 to 9 months ago, we are well positioned to deliver ongoing financial success.","Our gross and operating margins remain among the highest in the industry, as we continue to run a highly profitable homebuilding operation, which is critical in any operating environment.","We grow increasingly efficient with our land pipeline, as we shorten its duration, increase option usage and remain fundamentally disciplined in the level of land investment we are making. And we continue to execute against our return base strategies with a focus on delivering through cycle performance. I think you see elements of these industry and company dynamics in PulteGroup's third quarter results. We delivered strong financial performance as we grew revenues by 25%, expanded operating margins by 190 basis points to 14.2% and increased earnings per share by 74% to $1.01 per share, all while generating high returns on invested capital. At the same time, however, we realized a slower conversion of high traffic volumes as consumers continue to adjust to current market conditions. And consistent with our stated capital allocation strategies, we returned $93 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to more than $250 million.","As I said, and our Q3 results clearly demonstrate, PulteGroup is staying disciplined in the execution of our strategic initiatives and remains well positioned to operate in today's evolving housing market.","Now let me turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. PulteGroup reported another strong quarter with meaningful performance gains realized in key operating and financial metrics. For the quarter, our net signups totaled 5,350 homes, which is up 1% over last year. Signup trends by buyer group in the third quarter were similar to what we experienced in Q2 of this year, as first-time orders declined 13% from last year to 1,373 homes, while move-up orders were down 1% to 2,456 homes. Demand among active adult buyers remained exceptionally strong in the third quarter as orders increased 22% over 2017 to 1,521 homes.","Looking at our orders in a little more detail. First-time signups within our Southeast area were down in the quarter, most notably in our Charlotte, Raleigh and Coastal markets, which were impacted by Hurricane Florence. We also recorded fewer signups in our west area where, similar to Q2, the decline related primarily to Northern California, where we're experiencing softer demand for our first-time, albeit, higher priced homes.","As Ryan highlighted, traffic to our communities was strong throughout the quarter and was up 15% over last year. Based solely on this metric, I think it's reasonable to say that buyer interest remains high. With traffic in our stores, we believe it's a matter of effectively responding to buyer concerns, real and perceived, to generate stronger sales in future periods.","Given our focus on returns and through cycle performance, we're moving purposely but intently in adjusting community positioning to evolving market conditions as needed.","Looking at our absorption paces, our Q3 absorptions were down 7% compared with the third quarter of last year, which is consistent with our experience for the second quarter of this year. By buyer group, absorption pace among first-time buyers was down 21%, which reflects the impact of slower sales pace, as I referenced in our Southeast and Northern California markets. While pace decreased 7% among move-up buyers and increased 9% among active adult buyers.","Moving on to our income statement. We generated strong top line growth as homebuilding revenues increased 25% over last year to $2.6 billion. The higher revenues were -- for Q3 were driven by a 17% increase in closings to 6,031 homes in combination with a 7% or $27,000 increase in average sales price, $427,000.","The year-over-year increase in Q3 average sales price was the result of price increases across all buyer groups. For the quarter, our average sales price among first-time buyers increased 25% over last year to $366,000. ASPs among move-up buyers increased 3% to $477,000 and active adult prices increased 2% to $398,000. The 25% increase in prices for first-time buyer communities is consistent with the pricing increase we noted in Q2, and reflects a mix shift that includes more California closings. Closings by buyer group in the quarter included 27% first-time, 47% move-up and 26% active adult, which is consistent with last year.","At the end of Q3, we had a total of 11,202 homes under construction of which 8,286 homes or 74% were sold units and 2,916 or 26% were spec. Within our spec production, only 532 of the homes were finished.","Given the composition of our production pipeline, we expect fourth quarter deliveries to be in the range of 6,500 to 6,800 homes, which would put us within our guidance for full year closings of 22,500 to 23,500 homes. Based on our backlog and current production schedule, we expect our Q4 average sales price to be in the range of $420,000 to $430,000. This is a slight adjustment from our prior guidance of $415,000 to $425,000.","For the quarter, the company's gross margin was 24%, which is up 10 basis points over last year, as our operations continue to perform at a very high level. Reflective of the strong selling conditions in the first half of 2018, our Q3 gross margin benefited from higher option revenues and lot premiums, which increased 7.7% or approximately $6,000 over last year to just over $82,000 per home. It's also worth noting that sales discounts in the third quarter decreased 10 basis points to 3% of average sales price or $13,000 per home. Given that overall market conditions have gotten more competitive, we expect Q4 gross margin will likely come in towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of 23.8% to 24.3%.","Reflecting our ongoing efforts to run a more efficient business, our third quarter SG&A expense was $253 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expenses of $237 million or 11.6% of home sale revenues. Based on our expected closings and revenues for the fourth quarter, we expect our fourth quarter SG&A to be in the range of 9.5% to 10% of home sale revenues.","Continuing down the income statement. Our financial services business has generated pretax income of $20 million, which is up 10% over last year's third quarter. For the quarter, we generated higher mortgage originations resulting from the increased closings in our homebuilding operations. It's worth noting that our mortgage operations experienced decrease in Q3 capture rate from 80% to 75% as well as compressed margins on loan originations due to the highly competitive conditions that continue in the mortgage market.","Looking at our taxes. We recorded $95 million of income tax expense for the quarter, which represents an effective tax rate of 24.7%. In total, our net income for the quarter was $290 million, which represents a 63% increase over prior year net income of $178 million. More impressively, our earnings increased 74% on a per share basis from $0.58 per share to $1.01 per share. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was calculated using approximately 285 million shares, which is a decrease of 16 million shares or 5% from Q3 of last year. The lower share count is due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase activities, pursuant to which we repurchased 2.4 million common shares for $67 million or an average cost of $28.14 per share in the third quarter.","We ended the quarter with $759 million in cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%. As previously discussed, strong earnings are working to quickly lower our leverage, taking us closer to the midpoint of our target debt-to-capital range of 30% to 40%.","I'll finish my prepared comments with a few data points related to our homebuilding operations. Community count for the third quarter was 843, which is up 8% over last year. This increase above our guidance of 3% to 5% quarterly growth reflects the slower close out of certain communities rather than acceleration in new community openings.","During the quarter, we invested $254 million in land acquisition and approved an additional 6,500 lots for purchase. Of the lots approved in the quarter, approximately 43% were under some form of option. Our year-to-date land acquisition spend of approximately $900 million is in line with our planned 10% increase, although our year-to-date land development spend is running a little behind our projected 10% increase.","We ended the third quarter with approximately 150,000 lots under control of which approximately 41% are controlled via option. Based on the trailing 12 months of closings, we've reduced our owned lot position to less than 3.9 years and continue making steady progress toward our long-term goal of owning three years of land or less.","Shortening the duration of the owned portion of our land pipeline is supportive of our efforts to improve asset terms and overall returns on invested capital. At the same time, the increase in option lots allows us to ensure future lot supply while reducing market risks.","We see our disciplined, measured and lower risk approach to land investment being consistent with our focus on delivering better through-cycle performance, especially given the changing market conditions that appear to be developing. And finally, we now expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash flow in 2018, which reflects our continued strong operating performance.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan for a few final comments. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks, Bob. While I have already provided an overview of market conditions, I will offer a few comments on how the regions performed during the quarter. Along the eastern 1\/3 of the country, we realized strong results in our Northeast and Florida operations, while our Southeast markets were more challenged, driven in some part by Hurricane Florence. In the middle 1\/3 of the country, generally strong sales across our Texas markets helped to offset some softness we experienced in the Midwest. And in our Western markets, strong sales in our Arizona and Southern California markets were generally offset by slower demand in our Northern California and Seattle operations.","Demand conditions through the first few weeks of October are consistent with trends that we saw in Q3 as high levels of traffic demonstrate ongoing buyer interest, but with consumers taking longer to make their purchase decision.","In closing, I want to thank all of our employees who work hard every day to provide an outstanding home and buying experience to our customers. It's only through your efforts that we achieve the exceptional operating and financial results that we continue to deliver.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Ryan. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions]. David, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner","So I guess the -- if I look at your results this quarter, pretty similar to 2Q. Order growth pretty much right in line with what you did last quarter, margins flat. Ryan, your tone I think is more -- comes across as more cautious now versus what it was in July. And I know back then you still felt like there was some pricing power in the market you pointed to, incentives that were actually moving lower. And I know on a closings basis they were lower again this quarter. So -- yes, can you just help square a little bit? When I look at the result everything seems to be fairly status quo over the last six months or so but it sounds like you've seen a shift in the market. So are you starting to see other builders discounting more? Has that pricing power you mentioned last quarter eroded? Or are you taking a more aggressive stance on discounting, which might have some implications on margins into '19?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. And I'll do my -- there's a lot there so I'll do my best to touch on all those points. Let me, maybe, just start first and foremost with our view of the market, and I'll echo some of the things that I had in my prepared remarks which is, we still believe in the fundamentals of this housing recovery. We've got good GDP growth, interest rates are still historically low, acknowledging that they're moving upward, which is creating some challenges in affordability. That combined with overall asset values that have increased fairly rapidly over the last 12 to 18 months I think is part of what's created some of the slowness or the hesitancy on behalf of the buyers to transact. We still believe that we're underbuilding relative to what the need is there. On a single-family start basis, I would characterize normal as somewhere in the $1 million start range and we're at about $850,000, so call it 20% below where normal is. So we still believe that this market has got room to expand and room to run. Inventory levels are still below six months, which I think all would likely agree is considered normal. We're right around four months on the resale side and less than that on the new home side. ","So the market has gotten more competitive there's no question about that. We are seeing additional incentives out there in the marketplace. I would characterize the incentives that we're seeing as normal. I haven't seen anything that I would put in the category of being irresponsible to this point. To that end, and we talked about it on our Q2 call, our local management teams on a community-by-community basis are empowered to make the decisions that need to be made to ensure that we're balancing the price and the pace equation. And I think you're seeing that come through in our results. So that's -- I'll take a breath there and then let you maybe come back with a follow-up if anything I haven't touched on.","Alan Ratner","Yes. No, I appreciate that Ryan. So I guess just kind of parsing through that. When we look at your orders which have been kind of flattish last couple of quarters and just reading between the lines in terms of kind of empowering the local operators to make those decisions, is that the way you're kind of running the business right now that you want to maintain a fairly steady volume throughput, and obviously, the demand environment will dictate what you do on the pricing side to kind of generate that or am I interpreting that wrong?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, I would probably characterize it just slightly different. Growth is an important part of our overall story, and we're -- we've acknowledged the last couple of quarters have been a little bit more challenging and we've seen flattish type growth. And I think that's reflective of the current operating environment. Buyer interest remains high. So I think that's a positive, it's not like the buyers have disappeared from the shopping environment. But it's been a more difficult environment. We're not going to overreact by giving away all of the margin that we've worked so hard to earn, but we're going to make the decisions that we need to make to make sure that we're continuing to turn the inventory. Being a production builder, I think you can appreciate how important that is to the overall equation of driving returns. I think we've made those appropriate decisions, and we've made the appropriate tradeoffs. But keeping up with market growth is an important part of what our overall story is. I think you saw our gross margins in Q3 come in near the lower end of our guide, and that's reflective of the fact that we did put some additional incentives in place to help move order growth.","Alan Ratner","Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then just on the margin front, given the softer demand, what are you guys seeing on the cost side right now? Obviously, lumber is in the news, but I would imagine this time of year you're starting to have some conversations with your suppliers, with your subcontractors. Is that a push point where there could be any relief if the demand side remains a little bit sluggish over the next few months?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Alan, it's Bob. Candidly, we're always having those conversations with our suppliers and our trades. It's not necessarily just the year-end push. We haven't provided a guide for next year and we'll certainly do that when we release our fourth quarter earnings. I would characterize what we're experiencing today, a continuation of the theme. We've talked about that we saw a little bit of price increase -- cost increase this year, primarily labor. Obviously, lumber, everybody knows about. So one of the reasons we moved our guide down on margin in Q4 was that's when we'll feel the real brunt of that push-up in pricing early in the year. Obviously, that will provide some tailwind next year if pricing of lumber stays down where it is today relative to this year. But on a more broad basis, the commodity side of the business still feels pretty good. But labor, we're still paying for it, especially in markets where there's a lot of activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth Zener","I just want to ask, because I think you guys have been very sober about the cycle and how you guys want to be very measured in contrast to some other builders. So given that the decline -- easing demand wasn't really expected. I have kind of a large question, which is that, our view is that inventory is not necessarily tight because there's been high existing sales in many markets. And now with Western markets, a variety of markets showing rising inventory levels and falling sales. What would potentially be the implications for your business if inventory is not as tight as we -- as the nominal number suggests. And how would you kind of adjust FY '19 land spend if you could to kind of be reflecting the fact there is actually rising inventory, therefore, further slowdown in demand?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Ken, I think there's a lot of hypotheticals in the question. And so in an effort to maybe avoid kind of speculation I'm going to go with the numbers that we see out there and the numbers that we see would suggest that inventory is tight. If we were to be in an environment where inventory was to increase, I think simple supply-side economics would take over. And it would require us to make an adjustment to the volume of product that we're producing as well as pricing, would I think be the typical reaction that the market would expect.","Kenneth Zener","Okay. And I understand your desire to stay focused. And then on the order pace, we look at it sequentially. And it looked like you guys actually did -- so you had a little more community count. But the pace was kind of still down 16% sequentially, which was in line with the long-term average. Is that to suggest that there's rising pressure on gross margins as we look to FY '19? I'm just trying to understand the comments about easing demand but normal seasonality in the orders. It seems a little -- I'm just trying to understand how you could have a normal seasonality yet the concern around demand if there's not a lot of pace price pressure building?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Ken, we haven't given a guide for margins for '19. We're in the middle of our planning process right now. So it would be premature for us to put that out there. We'll -- again, we'll give color on that when we release our fourth quarter earnings. I think if you think about what's happened though, we've affirmed the Q4 guide that we have, obviously, that's a lot of backlog. So I think your question is one that the sales environment will dictate ultimately. So you heard Ryan say, in this quarter we took some actions that did impact our margins slightly. So clearly, the environment matters. But for the term that we've given guide, we still feel comfortable with the range that we have provided last quarter and will update you on '19 next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America.","John Lovallo","The first one is you talked about adjusting community count positioning to meet the current kind of affordability challenges. Other than potentially discounting, what are some of the other things that you can do? I mean, can you actually reposition product within these communities?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, John. It takes a little bit longer to move product. So in this current market environment, I -- you shouldn't see us make major changes to product offering. It just takes longer to work through municipalities typically. We do feel like we've got good offerings in the product portfolio that we have that allows consumers to make changes either in the structural options that they add to the home or maybe don't add to the home. They also have the ability to move up and down within the square footage range that we build within that community. So I think we're pretty well positioned there. As far as things that we can do, there are clearly incentives that we can offer as it relates to option packages, lot premiums. There's financing incentives that we can offer to help alleviate some of the pressure that we're feeling around overall affordability. And then, of course, the easiest thing potentially to do and sometimes the most painful from a profitability standpoint is just absolute base price adjustments, and we tend to go there last, is kind of the order of magnitude of change that we would typically make.","John Lovallo","Okay. That's helpful. And then, the 3Q inventory looks like it was actually a bit of a cash inflow in what's typically a quarter with significant cash used. I mean, is this really just timing related? Is it greater mix of options? What's kind of the rationale there?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes. I wouldn't say that there's anything unusual happening. Certainly, the increased desire and implementation of a higher optionality does have benefit as we're expanding the portfolio percentage of option. Certainly, we have less of a current need for cash to spend on dirt that would sit on the balance sheet. But I wouldn't look into it that much. If you think about it, the land just versus prior year is about flat despite us having more lots under control today than we did a year ago. But our house inventory is up about 12% to just under $1.4 billion, and that's reflective of just the number of houses we have in production.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","I wanted to ask you a question about incentives in the marketplace. I guess, in particular, by product type perhaps, how you've broken out first time, move up and that kind of thing. I'm wondering in general, when you look at the marketplace, the incentives you're seeing, are you seeing a little bit more or less at the lower end. And then with respect to that, some of your competitors have moved to a more standardized type of offering, particularly for the affordable product. And I was wondering if that -- if you're seeing that, result in them having fewer levers to pull. You just articulated a whole bunch of things you can do to avoid actually reducing the ASP, and you talked about options and stuff like that, that you can give away. If your -- some of your competitors have a much more standardized product, where I would think it'd be more difficult to make that change on the fly. So I was curious, if you are actually seeing people move to levers like ASP reduction more quickly this time than maybe in the past?","Ryan Marshall","Stephen, it's Ryan. I'll answer your second question first, as it relates to the product that is more standardized, if you will, less optionality, less choice. Yes, I think your answer there is if you've got to make adjustments to increase pace, it's going to be price. And it may be one of the levers that you have is financing or financing-type incentives. I suppose you could maybe do something with landscaping packages or things like that, that may not be standard so you could add in some enhancements that might entice a buyer. Those communities and that style of operating are typically in the secondary ring and some of the tertiary markets that we don't necessarily compete in today. So -- but that's my assessment of how the market's playing out. In terms of incentives that are out there by consumer group, I think it really comes down, Steven, to a market-by-market situation based on the specific geography or specific ZIP Code that you're competing in. And so to paint a particular consumer group with a broad brush across the entire country. I'm going to probably refrain from doing because I don't know that the information I'd give you would be accurate.","Stephen Kim","Okay. That's very helpful. So maybe geography is more important than consumer group.","Ryan Marshall","Correct.","Stephen Kim","Yes. In your opening remarks, I think, Ryan, you made a comment that perhaps some of the buyers are experiencing some difficulty getting a mortgage. I didn't hear that followed up with any specific commentary about move to ARMs, let's say, or increase, which I wouldn't expect actually, but -- or increased cancellation rates or a move within your communities to buying the smaller footprints or maybe more attached product, anything like that. Is there some sort of quantification or more detail you can provide to suggest -- to back up your comment that maybe some of the buyers are seeing an affordability constraint?","Ryan Marshall","Yes. Stephen, it's interesting. I'll give you just a few stats here, and then, maybe, just some color commentary to go with it. Our can rate was just under 15%. That's actually slightly lower than where we were prior year. ARM usage sits at 5%, which is down from where we were in the prior quarter. So we haven't seen a huge increase in ARMs. I think that has to do with the yield curve. There's not enough differential on the long part of the yield curve. Loan to values are still well within kind of the range that we've been operating in for the last couple of years. And credit scores for us, the loans that we actually financed through our mortgage company remain high. So I think some of the affordability challenges are really self -- probably more self-imposed by the buyers that are out shopping and they're making a decision to say, my overall payment is higher than what I'm comfortable with or higher than what I know I can afford and therefore, I'm not going to move to go into contract rather than seeing buyers actually sign up and get declined. And if that were the case, I think you'd see a lot of stats, so I just talked about increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","Ryan, last quarter you had mentioned, how you guys were also watching your web traffic and using that as an indirect indicator for how you expected sort of demand to come through over the next quarter. I guess have you seen anything change there? Are buyers still coming to your website? Is there anything in terms of the time they're spending or some of the product or the specificities that they're looking at?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Susan, great question. We're seeing a very good traffic to the website as well as into the stores. So both metrics are important. The website traffic is a leading indicator, and we continue to see positive year-over-year gains in the amount of web traffic that's coming on to the website. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw a 15% increase in store traffic at our physical models, which is probably the more important factor at the end of the day.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then your SG&A this quarter was really impressive relative to what we had modeled in there. Can you talk to maybe some of the factors that drove that? And maybe how we should be thinking about it going forward?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Susan, it's Bob. Certainly, it's been a focus of ours, candidly, since, well, always. But in particular, in 2016, we took some pretty big actions. We are, like I said, in our planning process so we'll wait till the fourth quarter to give you an update on what we see going forward. But the guide we gave for Q4, I think shows you that we continue to expect to see strong performance there. Yes, we're focused on all the things, so -- as we're going through planning. We're challenging all of the spend across the entire organization. I think, as an example, if we were to achieve the lower end of our guide this year for the fourth quarter, it puts us well within the range that we gave for the year, and certainly, improvement over the fourth quarter of last year.","Ryan Marshall","And Susan, the only thing I'd maybe add to that is, as far as kind of future leverage I'd expect that to come from volume growth as opposed to structural change within how we're operating.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","Ryan, just following on John's question about how you change product, et cetera. The things you were talking about, incentives on options, lot premiums, financing, et cetera. I assume that's more in the short run and has that negative gross margin effect. As you think about as you enter the spring selling season, how much can you do and what could you do to change the cost input, if you will, of the product? And maybe move that affordability conundrum that the consumer is facing, maybe move it down a little bit? And is that on your radar screen in a big way? Do you reposition for the spring, I guess, is what I'm asking?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Stephen. What I would tell you is similar to Bob's comment from a few questions ago. We're always grinding over what the cost input side of the business is. And our procurement teams, I believe, are best-in-class, and they're always working with our suppliers to put different products in, buy better to ensure that we win, and we want our suppliers to win as well. So that's certainly a focus. As far as kind of repositioning de-contenting houses, taking options out, those are steps that we're always cautious and hesitant to make because I think buyers know what they want and they want what they want. And so it's a tricky kind of tightrope walk to take things and options out of houses in an effort to lower prices. But certainly, something that we've done in the past and we're capable of doing, but it's a territory that I venture into cautiously. I think we've done a really nice job in all of our groups, our procurement group, our sales group, our operations team in putting the right options in that consumers want and can afford based on the way that we've targeted and positioned individual communities. So look, I go back to some of the things that I said a minute ago, Stephen. We still think that the underlying fundamentals of the market are strong, we're certainly in a little bit of a tougher period of time right now. But I don't know that I would expect that to continue for an extended period of time.","Stephen East","Okay. All right, fair enough. That's helpful. And then my typical capital allocation. With the slowdown, are you seeing land deals re-trading or is the market sort of stalled bid-ask spread if you will? Are you still approving land deals at the same rate, so to speak? And then I guess a couple of other things. How do you decide between share repurchase and land in development, particularly given what all these equities have done? And then finally, the M&A, again with the market meltdown, has your view changed any at all?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Well, that was a good way of getting more than one question into the question. So I'll try and cover the gamut there. Land spend, it is still a competitive market out there, Stephen. And pricing doesn't change, I think no different than any other point in time. If we see market conditions change and this is a very local conversation around an asset that we have under contract or other folks have under contract, you'll see it. You'll see re-trades happen where there's something that happens locally. So I would characterize that as being very much the same today. In terms of the dialogue inside this company, as it relates to repurchases versus land spend, I'd remind you, the way we've characterized it is, the first and foremost priority that we have is to invest in the business as long as we can do it at high returns. We use excess capital to repurchase our stock, pay our dividend and if we choose to, pay down some debt. And so you saw us move a little bit more money into the equity during this quarter than you had in the prior couple of quarters.","We've said it long that we're not stock pickers but we have an opinion about the value of the equity, and so that gets reflected in how much we choose to invest. As does our expectation for the business going forward and our longer term needs for capital, that won't change even with the equities being a little bit cheaper than they were, say, six months ago. And on M&A, I'd characterize us as isn't always on fire. We don't do a lot of deals because we're pretty picky about pricing. And so notwithstanding the fact that you're referencing clearly a public enterprise that we'd be thinking about. The same dynamic is true today as it was 3, 6, 9 months ago, a year ago. And that is, for something like that for us it would have to be a good strategic fit. And then it would have to be a good social fit too. Just because the equities have traded down doesn't mean that management teams believe their company is worth less, and I would start with ours. So just because the equities have moved to a lower price point doesn't mean that things get remarkably cheaper, especially on a relative basis. So for us it's always about strategic fit, how and where does their land book serve us and either bolster an existing position or benefit us by virtue of some, whether it's a different geography or different demographic in places where we operate. I think I got it all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.","Carl Reichardt","Can I go back to Susan's question on SG&A for a second. As typically in the past you've called out if there's been onetime items in SG&A that have helped or hurt. Was there anything onetime this quarter that drove that SG&A below guide?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","No, Carl. Typically, you're right. We call out stuff that's significant. This was the first time in a while, thankfully, a pretty clean quarter. So it's really just the business.","Carl Reichardt","Okay, good. And then just a broader question for you Ryan. So if you look at what you have done to date, whether it's incentives or lot premiums, base price cuts, whatever. I'm trying to get a sense of what the response has been from the consumer from an elasticity standpoint? Because the worry is always, well, prices fall that scares the consumer away as opposed to stimulating demand. Can you give me sort of a high-level sense of which incentives or declines, however you want to describe it are the consumers responding to elastically, and are there particular markets or price points where you're seeing that elasticity response the greatest?","Ryan Marshall","Yes. Carl, I think for the most part, the incentives that we've put in place have been very targeted against specific communities and specific MSAs where we felt like maybe the overall market had moved and we needed to make adjustments to be more competitive. And I don't believe that we've done anything that is so large that it would have rocked the confidence of the consumer in a way that you would describe. So as far as, kind of what did we get out of it, and what's the overall elasticity like. Hard to know what you would have gotten if you wouldn't have made adjustments. I don't have that kind of magic eight ball. I think we made appropriate decisions based on what we were seeing in the market. And for us, in this quarter, generated 1% growth year-over-year. So it's definitely a tougher operating environment out there. And I think we tried to be fairly transparent with our comments on that. There are a couple of markets that I would tell you we're on the higher priced end, like in Northern California and in Seattle, where I think the incentives there have gotten a little larger mostly because the prices had run so far and so fast, and it may have created a bit of paralysis in the market. I think in both of those locations, overall, supply is so tight, and there's such a shortage of inventory that I think it's short term in nature and that market will -- both those markets will free up and go back to more normal selling patterns soon enough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","I just want to go back kind of bigger picture and kind of piecing together some of the different comments that you've made so far this call. And if I'm interpreting it right, and I'd love, obviously, your thoughts on this. It seems like the approach you're taking against a market that perhaps has moved incentives a little bit more than yourselves, although, you're making your adjustments on your own as you point at your gross margins being at the lower end of your guidance. But it seems like you're taking a fairly gradual approach, not getting too aggressive given your comments around still strong traffic. Perhaps trying to wait it out, make some adjustments, but still in effect trying to hold on to a strong gross margin and being okay with a softer -- relatively softer maybe low single-digit, let's say, growth rate. Is that the right way to think about it in this current backdrop?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Mike, I probably would characterize it a little bit different than what you've described. What I would start with is, we don't have a lot of spec inventory. In fact we've got right around 500 finished specs on the ground today. And so the way we've built our business is we're selling dirt to be built orders. And so I think that puts us in a better position not to get into a desperate type position as the inventory starts to build, which we all know creates lots of -- has capital implications as well as cost implications as that inventory builds. And you maybe -- if you're in a situation where you had a lot of inventory, you may be facing or feeling more pressure to take bigger incentives. So as far as how we're behaving, I think we're using good judgment, Mike, in making pricing decisions to run the best business that we can for our shareholders. And I think the decisions that we've made are reflective of that mentality that we want to maintain the market share that we have. Growth is an important part of our business, so is profitability, and we're managing all those levers on a community-by-community basis within the overall environment that we're operating in. The local share and efficiency of production is certainly important and that gets factored into those overall pricing decisions that we make as well. So to say we're going to wait it out, hold on to margin, that's not who we are. And I don't think that's an appropriate characterization.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. No, I appreciate that response, it's helpful, obviously. I guess, secondly, perhaps you gave a little bit more color just now on Northern California and Seattle. I was hoping to get similar maybe a little bit more granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Texas, I believe you characterized it as generally strong. I don't know if there -- maybe you could across the top 3 or 4 markets, maybe give a little more color there. And when you talked about the Southeast region being a little more challenged from the hurricane, I was curious if you had a sense of what that might have impacted from -- in terms of an order growth standpoint. What the hit might have been to that region if you have any sense, excluding that event?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Mike. So I'll start with Texas. Texas was generally strong across the board, breaking down the four markets that we operate in. Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, all performed well. Houston was the one market that for us, anyway, was a bit slower. As far as the Southeast goes, couple of things there. The hurricane certainly had an impact. We've got large operations, all up and down the coastal part of South Carolina, where -- from Myrtle Beach to Wilmington to Charleston to Hilton Head, all of those areas were certainly impacted and then, to a lesser degree into Charlotte and Raleigh. So we haven't quantified what the impact was. And frankly, I think given the numbers that we delivered, we're not going to kind of get into the weeds there. I would tell you that other thing in the Southeast that had some bearing on our results for the quarter is we had to close out of several of the John Wieland communities that we got with that original acquisition. So as those have closed out and not all of them have been replaced on a one-for-one basis, that's had a big -- bit of impact in our Southeast numbers. And then the move-up business in that particular area was a tad slower.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG.","John Micenko","One of the strategies for Pulte over the last several years has been that lot premium option piece. And we've watched it kind of grow high single digits year to year. I think you said $82,000 a home. So I guess that'd be right around 20% of ASP. When do we hit terminal velocity there? Is there still ability to grow that number? How do we think about it? Because it's relevant to this discussion around incentives and options and that sort of thing.","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Jack, this is Ryan. It's a good question. I think we've struck the right balance where the goal and the objective there is to provide consumers with the flexibility that they want in picking the lot that they want to live on, and they're able to pick the things that are important to them as they configure their home. I think that works out into a more profitable equation for us, and creates a happier homeowner in that they're able to get the things that they truly value. As far as where that can grow, I don't believe that it can go to infinity. And so I think you've started to see the growth rate of that slow over the last couple of quarters. And it's basically grown in lockstep with our ASP growth. So we feel pretty good about where we're at, but it's something that we'll continue to look at in the overall value equation that the consumer considers when they're making a buying decision.","John Micenko","Okay. And then I guess the best analogue we have to the move-in rates this year is probably 2013 on a post-crisis basis. Obviously, the economy is better, but home prices are a lot higher now. Can you just talk about some of the observations, maybe compare, contrast '13 relative to the sort of traffic conversion disconnect you've been seeing?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Jack. I think you've highlighted the biggest change that I -- or the biggest difference that I see is 2013, the rate increases then were against an economic backdrop that is nowhere near what it is today. So economically, with GDP growing at 3.7%, unemployment at less than 3%. We're actually seeing some wage expansion. Consumer confidence is much higher. So just the whole kind of gamut of economic indicators are so much better today. That being said, the difference between -- one of the other big differences is asset prices are much higher today than what they were in 2013. So the overall equation of home price plus the absolute interest rate, I think that's created a package that is radically different from where we were 6 to 9 months ago. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but I think it bears repeating. And that is you've got a fair number of homeowners that are in existing homes that likely have interest rates sub-3%. And there may be a little bit of reluctance to give up on that interest rate as you consider moving now. I think time and life will kind of take care of that. Buyers are going to continue to have life events that create needs to sell and move or upsize, whether it's marriage, divorce, birth, job relocation, retirement, et cetera. I think those are some things that we'll continue to see. And Jack, I think you see the data just like we do. Rates are expected to continue to go up. The Fed is not signaling that they're going to slow down at all with rate increases as long as the economy continues to motor on at the rate that it is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl","First quick question. As you quantify the level of discounts and closings in 3Q at 3%. Can you give us a sense of on the orders that you signed in 3Q. What the average discounts were?","Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, Mike, we've historically not done that. Honestly, we're still going through the process of finalizing the optionality built into that, et cetera. So that will come when we give you our guide for next year. Obviously, we've given you a guide for Q4, which tells you that things have held up. Again, that might have been things that were sold through the second quarter. So more to come on that, but typically we wouldn't give you that kind of details because we just don't have it all yet.","Michael Dahl","Got it, okay. The second question is really a bit more high level. I think the Pulte, in the recent past has been maybe more balanced than peers in terms of thinking about kind of the broader customer segmentation in terms of entry level versus move up. There's a popular belief out there today that entry level or first time is still the relatively strong part of the market and where people want to shift to. Your own trend suggest a little bit different. I know you pointed out a couple of reasons why you may be different than some of your peers there, but I'm curious more on a high level. If we think about affordability as becoming more challenging. And that buyer -- almost by definition, the marginal buyer being most impacted by affordability. How are your views changing on where Pulte's mix should be going forward from a segmentation standpoint?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question. This is Ryan. I would agree with you that, that buyer group is the most rate-sensitive buyer. And in terms of kind of how that affects our view about long-term segmentation. I would tell you it's largely unchanged. We'd like to see 35% of our business in the first time entry level space. Our closings at this point that are coming through the business are closer to 30%, but the land that we control for that first time entry-level space is right at the 35% that we've targeted. So you'll start to see those closings come through our business over the course of the next couple of years as we develop and monetize that land pipeline. I would tell you -- the other thing that is worth highlighting and it is part of the reason that we love the active adult business so much. All of the conversation has kind of moved to the millennials and to the entry levels, but there is still a lot of boomers out there, they have high homeownership rates. And this is a buyer group that, for us anyway, 40% of them pay cash, and so they're much less interest-rate sensitive, which works to our advantage. And I think this is just kind of a great example of why we continue to invest in that space, and why we've tried to maintain a balanced position with the different consumer groups that we serve.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our allotted time for Q&A.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer.","Sir, please go ahead.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Katie and good morning. I'm pleased to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President-Finance.","A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to the website a little later.","PulteGroup's second quarter earnings in both 2018 and 2017 included several unusual items which are noted in the earnings release. As part of the call, we will comment on our reported results as well as our financial results adjusted to exclude the impact of these items.","We have provided a reconciliation of these adjusted numbers to our reported results in our earnings release and within the webcast slides posted as part of this morning's call.","We encourage you to review this information to assist in your analysis of our Q2 results. Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, let me remind everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's expected future performance.","Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks Jim and thank you to everyone joining us this morning's call. I am excited to discuss PulteGroup's outstanding second quarter results. As I know there are several earnings calls over the course of the day. Let me quickly summarize our Q2 results.","On a year-over-year basis PulteGroup's homebuilding revenues increased 25%. Our adjusted gross margin increased by 60 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin increased by 180 basis points and, most impressive, our adjusted earnings per share increased by 89%.","Our top line growth, operating gains and improved returns continue to benefit from solid execution of our established business practices. While these practices have been refined as the housing cycle has advanced, the core objectives have remained constant.","First, we're investing in the business through high returning projects, in fact over the past four-and-a-half years we've invested over $5 billion in acquiring new land assets. Throughout this period the fundamentals of our disciplined underwriting practices have not changed. Our focus remains on achieving high returns on invested capital as we continue to emphasize investing in smaller, faster turning projects. Consistent with our focus on returns, we've also expanded our lots under option which are now up to 40% of our controlled lot position to enhance returns and mitigate risks.","Second, we continue to realize efficiencies throughout our homebuilding operations. We are proud of the fact that we're routinely maintained among the highest gross margins and operating margins in the industry. This hasn't been achieved by chance, but by changing core business processes including the integration of extensive customer research into our product design and development.","Our innovative new floor plans are then rolled out through our common plan management platform. I'd highlight that 80% of our Q2 closings were from commonly managed plans. Once in the field, we use the innovative pricing system that we built seven years ago to help maximize higher margin option and lot premiums revenues.","Consistent with these practices we are finishing the market testing of our new active adult floor plans ahead of their national rollout early next year. I would also highlight that during our second quarter we launched our Pulte Smart Home. PulteGroup is the first builder to offer such smart home technology nationwide in every home that we build while allowing home buyers to select the technology components that best suit their needs. For some this means basic WiFi, while for others they want to control the entire home including heating and cooling, door locks, garage doors, entertainment and some, even their appliances.","And third, we're allocating capital in alignment with the company's stated priorities which includes returning funds to our shareholders. Our earnings per share and return on equity have been enhanced by systematically returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program.","Since 2013, we've returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders and have repurchased almost 30% of PulteGroup's common shares. Of course, all of these initiatives would have been just words on paper without the hard work and commitment of the industry's most talented team. I want to thank all of our employees who work hard every day to deliver the highest quality homes and an outstanding home buying and mortgage experience to our customers.","The business practices we've pursued in combination with the tremendous efforts of our employees certainly contributed to the significant gains realized in the second quarter.","The good news is that we see opportunities to get even better, as Bob will detail in a minute. Given the strength of our business, we are increasing our guidance on several key financial metrics.","It would be unwise for us to take all of the credit for the strength of the operating and financial gains. We recognize the favorable macro conditions that continue to surround and support our industry. As you would expect, when market dynamics include sustained demand and limited supply, prices will typically increase. This has certainly been the situation in housing for a number of years and has only continued as builders seek to pass through higher labor and material costs.","The ability to raise price is obviously positive, but affordability concerns are real, especially given mortgage rates which have been volatile. We continue to see increased traffic to our websites and to our communities, but the traffic to contract conversion rates eased a little during the quarter, particularly among first time and move-up buyers when mortgage rates rose in May. And while trends improved as the quarter progressed, buyers clearly want to see value in their purchase. This serves as a good reminder that affordability still matters.","To summarize, we remain very positive on market conditions and the ongoing demand for new homes. The country continues to benefit from a strong jobs market, exceptionally low unemployment, modest wage increases, and high consumer confidence, all of which are positive for housing demand. At the same time, the supply of new and existing homes remains low and continues to run below estimated need.","Within these operating conditions, our broad geographic presence, diversified product offering and strong operating platform has the company positioned well for ongoing success.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our outstanding Q2 results. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Ryan and good morning. The company's Q2 results represent another quarter of material year-over-year increases and performance gains.","As noted in our release, our second quarter results for 2018 and 2017 include several unusual items. As a result, I will discuss reported as well as adjusted numbers to provide a clear understanding of our underlying business performance.","Starting with signups, we reported a total of 6,341 signups in the quarter which was comparable with last year. By buyer group, first time orders decreased 13% to 1,657 homes. Move-up orders declined by 2% to 2,906 homes and active adult orders increased 16% to 1,778 homes.","Traffic to our communities remained high throughout the quarter. The lower signups among first time and move-up buyers reflect the modest slowdown in conversion rates that we experienced toward the middle of the quarter.","As Ryan mentioned, we believe this may have been in response to the rise in mortgage interest rates. The strength within our active adult business, up 16%, demonstrates why we have always worked to maintain a strong presence among each of the primary buyer groups.","Reported Q2 signups were also impacted by actions we took in certain markets and communities to effectively manage lot releases, sales pace, and pricing. While every community is different, at present we generally believe that maximizing price and margin over pace is the best way to deliver long term high returns.","You can see the benefit of this strategy in the strength of our gross margins which are being realized while still growing our expected delivery volumes over last year.","Given a 5% increase in community count in the second quarter, absorption pace was down approximately 6% compared with last year. Consistent with Ryan's comments on the strength of our Q2 financial results, we generated significant gains throughout our income statement.","Starting at the top, our home sale revenues increased 25% to $2.5 billion. Our higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 14% increase in closings to 5,741 homes along with a 10% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $427. The $37,000 increase in our average sales price for the quarter reflects pricing gains across all buyer groups.","For the second quarter, the average sales price for first time buyers increased 25% of the prior year to $360,000 while move-up gained 8% to $490,000, and active adult was up 3% to $389,000.","We continued to experience pricing strength within our first time buyer communities, but the 25% increase in Q2 was influenced by closings out of California. As we've talked about on prior calls, we have California communities serving first time buyers often older millennials who are buying their first home with average sales prices well over $700,000.","These are typically townhouse communities on community rail lines where the buyer is likely a software engineer or two working at one of the many tech companies in the area.","Looking at our Q2 closings by buyer group they breakdown as follows, 30% first time, 46% move-up, and 24% active adult which is consistent with last year.","In terms of our production universe, we ended the second quarter with 11,845 homes in backlog and 11,158 homes under construction. Of the homes under construction, 8,550 or 77% are sold units with the remaining 23% being spec production. Given this production pipeline, we expect third quarter deliveries to increase to between 6,000 and 6,300 homes which will represent an increase of 17% to 22% over last year and keep us on track to achieve our expected full year 2018 closings in the range of 22,500 to 23,500 homes.","Given the price increases we've utilized in our signups, we now expect closings over the remaining two quarters to have an average sales price in the range of $415,000 to $425,000. This is an increase from our prior guidance of $405,000 to $420,000.","Continuing down the income statement, our gross margin for the quarter was 24% which is up 60 basis points over the last year's adjusted gross margin of 23.4% and up 40 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of this year. Note that our prior year adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the land-related and warranty charges taken in that period.","Supported by our strategic pricing methodology, gross margins continue to benefit from higher option revenues and lot premiums. On a year-over-year basis, option revenues and lot premiums increased 5.5% or just over $4,000 to $79,429 per home.","Attesting to the relative strength of the operating environment sales discounts in the quarter fell 30 basis points to 3.2% of average sales price or $14,000 per home.","Given current market conditions, and consistent with our focus on delivering high returns on invested capital, we're finding opportunities to further extend our industry-leading gross margins. As a result, we're updating our guidance for the remainder of 2018 and now expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, and Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 23.8% to 24.3%. This is up from our prior guide of 23% to 23.5% for both quarters.","The sequential change in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 reflects the impact of higher lumber costs which are moving through the system. We also expect to change, on a relative basis, in the number of closings from certain higher margin communities in California, given current lot availability and our actions to better balance sales, production and lot development in support of support returns.","Looking at our overheads, we also generated significantly better operating leverage in the quarter. Our reported SG&A expense of $226 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues includes the $38 million benefit associated with an insurance related reserve adjustment recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit, our adjusted SG&A for Q2 was $264 million or 10.8% of home sale revenues.","Our current year performance represents an improvement of 120 basis points over our prior year. Given our results for the first half of 2018, we're reaffirming our guidance that we expect full year 2018 SG&A to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.3% of home sale revenues. This guidance excludes the impact of the insurance reserve adjustment recorded in this quarter.","In the second quarter, we also generated net land sale gains of $27 million, primarily resulting from the sale of two land parcels neither of which was included in last year's actions on non-core assets. The decision to sell these positions reflects our focus on balancing land investments, returns and risks across our portfolio.","For the quarter, our financial services business generated pre-tax income of $21 million which represents an increase of 9% over the second quarter of last year. The increase in pre-tax income for the quarter was primarily the result of higher volumes in our homebuilding operations.","Our mortgage capture rate in the quarter was 76% which is down from 79% last year and which reflects the highly competitive market conditions that exist today.","Our reported income tax expense for the second quarter was $85 million which represents an effective tax rate of 20.8%. Our tax rate for the quarter includes $17 million of net tax benefit related primarily to energy tax credits and accounting method change that was accepted by the IRS during the second quarter and changes in certain state tax laws. Excluding these items, the company's effective tax rate was approximately 25% which is consistent with our prior guidance.","For the second quarter, PulteGroup's reported net income was $324 million or $1.12 per share compared with reported net income of $101 million or $0.32 per share last year. On an adjusted basis, our net income for the quarter was $259 million or $0.89 per share compared with adjusted net income of $148 million or $0.47 per share last year.","On a per share basis, our adjusted 2018 results represent a significant 89% increase over our adjusted results last year. Q2 diluted earnings per share were calculated using approximately 287 million shares which is a decrease of 27 million shares or 9% from 2017. The decrease in share count is due primarily to the company's ongoing share repurchase activities.","Switching over to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $402 million of cash. During the quarter, we used $53 million of cash to repurchase 1.7 million common shares at an average price of $30.07 per share. In total this year, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares for $105 million and have $489 million remaining on our repurchase authorization.","We ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.9%. This is down from 42% at the start of the year and is now within our target range of 30% to 40%. Based on normal operations, we expect our leverage ratio to continue trending lower through the remainder of 2018.","As I mentioned earlier, we ended the second quarter with 11,158 homes under construction which represents an increase of 1,570 homes over last year. The increase reflects higher sold units under production as we continue to control specs, having fewer than 600 finished spec homes across our operations.","For the quarter, our community count was up 5% over last year to 847. This increase is consistent with our guidance of 3% to 5% quarterly growth which we'll maintain for the third and fourth quarters of 2018.","During the second quarter, we invested approximately $352 million in land acquisition and we approved an additional 6,900 lots to purchase of which approximately 57% were under some form of option. We continue to focus on acquiring communities that are smaller and with shorter durations as the average deal size, including several new Del Webb positions was about 120 lots per community.","Through the first six months of 2018, the company invested $640 million in land acquisition and $650 million in land development. This keeps us on track to invest approximately $2.8 million in land acquisition and development in 2018 which is up 10% over last year.","Given the company's improved profitability even with this significant land investment, we now expect to generate between $900 million and $1.1 billion of cash in 2018 before dividends and share repurchase activities. This is an increase of $200 million from our prior guidance.","As Ryan mentioned, at the end of the quarter we controlled approximately 149,000 lots of which approximately 40% are controlled via option. Based on the trailing 12 month of our deliveries, we have successfully reduced our owned lot position down to 4 years as to make steady progress toward our long-term goal of owning three years or less.","Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Before we open up the call to questions, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions we experienced during the quarter. As I said earlier, the macro economic backdrop remains favorable as unemployment is low and consumer confidence is high which supports our continued positive view of the market.","Looking at conditions across our regions, demand in our North-Eastern Florida markets remained strong in the quarter while our Southeast markets experienced more volatility. Overall, buyer interest and traffic levels remained high on the East Coast.","Consistent with my earlier comments, we were pleased with demand in the middle third of the country as traffic and buyer interest generally remained solid in the Midwest and Texas. And finally, out West, we continue to see good demand in the markets although reported signups were down for the quarter. Lower signups reflect price versus pace decisions we made given lot constraints, land development delays and lengthening backlogs in certain markets. Through the first few weeks of July, we continue to see high levels of traffic to our website and in turn to our communities.","In closing, the company has delivered exceptional financial results in the first two quarters of 2018. With the backlog approaching 12,000 homes valued at $5.2 billion in combination with strong gross margins, we're well positioned to report a full year of outstanding performance.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Great, thank you. We'll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of the call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Katie, if you explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I guess addressing probably the area of most interest across the investor base today, in regards to demand trends and the order results that you referred to by segment and also during the quarter. I was interested in terms of the comments you made that trends improved as the quarter progressed and that you saw a little bit of a slowdown in May which is interesting given that rates did move, but perhaps only 10 bps, 20 bps intra-quarter within that month. So I was curious if you could kind of give us a sense month by month what the order growth was during the quarter; April, May, June. And kind of bigger picture also, does this cause you to make any adjustments in terms of your land purchase activity if the demand can be this susceptible to such a small move in rates?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Mike, good morning. This is Ryan. Good question. What I would tell \u2013 I think I've answered the first part of your question which is we saw things get better as we moved throughout the quarter. As I mentioned May was the month where we saw a bit of softness. To the broader question, I think it really kind of goes to how do we see business overall, and at a national level, I'd tell you that the business is good and buyer traffic to our website, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, and more importantly into the communities remains high. So buyers are out. They're shopping and then that translates into sales. So that being said, the local conditions matter and we are seeing some variation in demand across certain markets and buyer groups.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that, Ryan. And I guess just on my second question, first off, if there's any ability to be a little more specific in terms of month by month if June turned positive, for example, that would be I think of interest, but I guess the other part of the coin is you had mentioned that part of the decline or the slowdown in order growth was also due to kind of maybe choosing price and margin over pace. Given your margins being at solidly above industry averages and you even raised your margin guidance, are you at a point where you want to maybe drive the volume growth, the order growth, do you feel like we're at a point in the cycle now where just kind of moving the ship forward and obviously, given the increased lot position and continued strong land spend that the gross margins are sufficiently strong and you can kind of even just hold gross margins where they or throttle them back a little bit to ensure a steady volume growth going over the next couple of years?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, there was a lot in that question, so let me see if I can touch on as many as parts of it as I can. Our strategy has remained very solid in that we're focused on driving the best returns that we possibly can for shareholders. And we do that by managing the pace and the price levers on a community by community basis.","So we're very proud of our gross margins and this second quarter, I think, is a testament to the great work that we've done on both the sales price side as well as the cost side to create an environment where we do have the best margins in the business. Volume is certainly a part of that equation and we had a nice quarter in the number of sign-ups that have been generated that have contributed to a backlog that's approaching 12,000 units.","So we're continuing to see favorable demand trends, we like what we're seeing in our sales offices and we're hearing from buyers. As I mentioned, value is something that's really important to buyers, affordability is important. As sales prices have gone up and mortgage rates have ticked up, I think it's the two things in concert that have contributed to a bit of the softness that we saw intra-quarter. We'll continue to address it on a community by community basis and rest assured that volume will continue to be part of the story for PulteGroup.","As far as your question on planned land spend, we don't have any plan change in our land spend. We're executing well through six months of the year and we don't see anything changing throughout the balance which is reflective of our positive view of the market that I think both Bob and I touched on in our prepared remarks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thanks very much, guys and congratulations on the results. Ryan, I wanted to follow-up on your most recent comment there about the decision to manage pace and price and all that. I was curious as to what kind of a difference you would need to see in the environment for you to shift the lever more towards volume than what you have seen thus far which has encouraged you to sort of keep the lever very much on the side of profitability and be willing to sustain a slightly negative order comparison this quarter. Could you just give us a sense for what would be different about the environment that you see that would cause you to shift that lever more noticeably to the volume side?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Stephen, good question. And it really does come down to a community by community basis for us in terms of how we pull the volume lever. We certainly pay attention to all the macro trends, consumer confidence, what kind of resale inventory is available, what kind of new home inventory is available. Those are all the things that I think play into the decisions that we'd ultimately make on volume.","As we've long talked about, we're looking to drive the best possible returns that we can out of the business and when we look at what our lot availability is, what the size of our backlog is, what the pricing environment is, how we measure up demand conditions, all of those \u2013 the local market conditions overall, how a local economy is growing, all of those things play into the ultimate decisions that we make around volume.","So, one of the things that I'd tell you is we've been steadfast in our volume guidance for the year at 22,500 to 23,500 units for the year. We took that up 500 units in the last quarter and, as you heard Bob say, we've reaffirmed that. So we're still performing very much in line with how we saw the business and we'll continue to look at overall market conditions and make those decisions on a community by community basis.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. I guess, I was wondering, you mentioned that out West you sustained lower orders but that also was due to the fact that you were seeing some lengthening backlogs and you sort of assessed the landscape out there and so you sort of deliberately lowered some of your volume and order taking. I was wondering if this was a process in your mind that \u2013 and if so, if you could give us a sense of how far into the process you are? And I am specifically thinking about probably your backlog cycle times that you felt like were lengthening to the point where you could probably bring those in a little bit and going slower on the orders, are they right-sized now? Are you at a right level of cycle time such that you can now start to be a little bit more aggressive out West or is this something that you think is going to take another quarter or maybe two.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Well, we like where our cycle times are Stephen. We're always going to \u2013 as a production builder, inventory turns are a big component of how we drive success, so we're always going to work to improve the cycle times of our, specifically our house inventory and more importantly our land inventory, it's part of the reason that we've driving to get our owned lots shorter which we're making great progress against. As far as California goes, it's really specific to a couple of areas in the West where it was timing of new community openings last year along with some new community openings this year, combined with what was a fairly large backlog of sold homes and so, in that pricing environment and the limited lot availability, a difficult entitlement environment, we've made the decision there to control paces in certain communities and maximize price.","The other thing I'd add, not a huge driver but it's worth mentioning, consistent with our focus of staying closer to the city centers, we have built out of our positions in Fresno and Sacramento which contributed to last year's sales paces.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, all.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I guess, if you could comment maybe also the order trends, obviously, in focus. We tend to look at order pace sequentially, so you guys were down 11% versus the normal down 3%. I get it. My question is what we're seeing in our A to Z (32:24) report where we look at existing sales inventory, we are seeing rising existing inventory. And since you just mentioned Sacramento, what we've seen is when existing inventory rises, it tends to have an impact on the new home sales. We do see that specifically in Sacramento, for example, could you comment if you're seeing a relationship within your markets where you see inventory rising, for example, I think Nashville was up 30% year-over-year now, but are you seeing that suppress your new sales at all in type of market dynamics? Thank you very much.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Ken, good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. There is a relationship there and we certainly acknowledge that. The key point there is resale inventory is still below normal. Normally it would be considered six months, in most markets there is a lot that are 2.5 to 3.5 months, so a slight tick up in that I don't think has a dramatic impact on the new home sales environment. If we saw inventory level start to go over six months in certain markets you'd certainly probably see a bigger impact.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi, Ivy.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Nice quarter. Maybe you can help provide some clarity on the fact that discounts actually decreased relative to, I guess, the year ago, I think you said 3.2% and the fact that you're seeing slower conversion or the first-time buyer and some maybe reaction to rising rates. So I guess what I want to understand is while discounts are declining, it sounds like you're not able to see as much conversion and maybe pricing power. So can you explain that better please?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Ivy. It's a pretty simple explanation that we're sticking to our discipline around pricing and we've got excellent locations, our communities are executed well which is a credit to the wonderful teams that we have in the field operating our businesses and we're still able to do drive some pricing power. And as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, it's a big component of driving returns and we like what we're seeing out of the business today. We're going to continue to pay attention to what's going on in the broader economy and be sensitive to a number of the things that we've touched on as it relates to new home inventory, resale inventory, interest rates, overall affordability, et cetera. But right now, we really like the business that we have. It was an outstanding quarter for the company that we're proud of. We like what we're seeing with overall traffic demand, and we'll continue to make modifications on a community by community basis as we need to.","The other thing that I point out is we don't have a ton of spec inventory which is by design. That's how we run our business. And so some of the places where I think you're seeing probably more incentives and more discounting, it's probably with those that have strategies that are more heavily dependent upon spec inventory.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, the one thing I'd add to that, sorry Ivy, the one thing I'd add to that is while it's down 30 basis points, the dollars are about the same, so it's really reflective of our ASP increasing, it's still about $14,000 a unit.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Got it. So just in terms of understanding I recognize the asset that you have and you want to maximize the returns. The consumer, if you think about that consumer that's buying the first townhome, the older millennial $700,000 whoever it is, are you able to raise price to make that contract \u2013 execute that contract or you have to hold price?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","I'm not sure we understand your question.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Are you seeing apples to apples stability in that segment of the market where there is more sensitivity around rates and affordability, are you able to take that same product maybe compared to where you were a year ago and actually raise prices on that $700,000 townhome.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. This is one where the mix matters. I mean, certainly, you can see our ASPs are up across all buyer segments so, yes, we have had pricing power. I think if you think of the prepared comments, we talked about the fact that we think affordability matters. So going forward if rates are rising that may be a little bit more challenging but we have seen the ability to increase prices and candidly it's reflected in our margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to just first of all clarify on the ASP commentary. Bob, I think you said $415,000 to $425,000, but I think I heard you say for the last two quarters of the year, is that for the full year or for the last two quarters of the year, obviously the reason I'm asking because you had a very strong performance, sorry, in the 2Q, so just wanted to clarify.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, that's for the balance of the year, Nishu, not average for the year.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. So what would mix it down again, was there something that drove it quite strongly in the second quarter that's going to reverse kind of mix effect wise in the second half of the year.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. We had highlighted that California has a number of years of high price points that we talked about in the first quarter as it influenced, had a little bit less in the second quarter as the volume ramps up for the year and the same will be true of the back half of the year, it will be a smaller percentage of the total business.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And on SG&A, strong performance in 2Q, why not lower it for the year off of that strength, is there something like the ASC 606 increasing SG&A in the back half of the year or are you just \u2013 will the strong performance kind of lower you than the range?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","You know Nishu we've guided to the range that we expect to come in. We have focused a lot on SG&A, we've made a ton of progress year-over-year and continue to do that. I don't know that you'll ever necessarily see us be the lowest SG&A company because we do make some investments in things around quality and culture of the company that we think are important but we have gotten substantially more competitive with our SG&A leverage and we're very proud of that.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, the thing I'd add Nishu, is we actually, if you remember we had updated our guide at the end of the first quarter which was reflective of the increase in the volume guide that we had given. We haven't changed our volume guide and we've talked about that from here forward for all the things Ryan has talked about in terms of how and why we spend our SG&A, it's going to be a kind of a margin game in terms of incremental volume would drive better overhead leverage, we haven't projected higher volumes and therefore we're still comfortable with our range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo.","Truman Patterson - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Truman Patterson on for Stephen East. How are you guys doing?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Good. How are you?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Doing well, Truman.","Truman Patterson - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good. Hey, just wanted to follow-up on the demand side of the world, especially any recent change in consumer behavior. Really on the pricing side, has pricing started to scare off any customers in any region or buyer segment? I'm really thinking orders fell for the first time buyer and move-up and they also fell in four of your regions, just trying to get your sense on really the pricing side of the world rather than the mortgage rate side.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Truman, what I would tell you and I mentioned a little bit in Mike's question, at a national level the business is good but local market conditions do matter. And the example that I'd give you is Texas is doing well as a state, but we saw Houston slow a little bit among first time buyers. The West is strong from a demand standpoint, but we did see demand in Southern California get a little bit soft, again with those first time buyers.","The Midwest is okay, but demand in Minnesota seemed to decelerate a little bit as we moved through the quarter, and then kind of ending with the Southeast, demand there is holding up, but the higher price points were off a tad. So overall housing demand is okay, but the individual markets do matter.","For us, we did see most of the softening in the lower price points with our first time buyers and I do think that is reflective of a combination of price and mortgage rates, I think both matter. So that particular segment has been strong as of late. Proportionate to the overall sales price, the increases in lumber packages have had a disproportionate impact on that particular price and so I think not just us but all builders have worked to pass that through to the consumer. And I think, it's safe to assume that it certainly has an impact on how they see value and what they can afford ultimately at the end of the day.","Truman Patterson - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks guys. And then I don't know if I heard this in your prepared remarks, did you guys actually give absorptions by buyer segment and then in June with that rebounding did you guys change up any incentives at all in the markets?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Well, absorptions by buyer group; first time down 19%, move-up down 5%, active adult up 5% which blends to the down 6% for the quarter.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Then incentives?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Incentives, we've not had any meaningful incentive programs. We've obviously seen in markets people have started talking about national sales. We're not there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Micenko from SIG.","John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Hi. Good morning guys. Another demand related question, shocker. Can you give us sales pace maybe by region, particularly maybe in the Southeast, what was happening in some of the regions you saw the sort of some of the lower order numbers?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Jack, what I'd tell you about the Southeast, as I mentioned in the prior question, we did see a little bit of softness in the higher price points in the Southeast. But the biggest driver there for us, we've closed out of several of our original John Wieland communities that were acquired as part of that purchase which was anticipated and projected and we simply have not replaced those on a one-for-one basis, so some of what you see in our Southeast numbers is reflective of that.","John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay. And then, the margin on the land sale, it's probably one of the better margins you've seen, I think, back into 2013 or 2014 at least, and it wasn't part of the \u2013 it didn't sound like it was part of the modernization effort from maybe a year ago. What was that and what product segment did you feel like you could sell into a better opportunity?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, so you've got a couple of different assets there, out West both of them. One was in a market that we're not actually building in today and so we had an asset that was buildable by us, but we didn't have a production team and so we elected to sell it, and so there was real value embedded in that. The second was from a community that we had purchased recently actually and really we were trying to balance our appetite for risk in that particular market, so we sold off one of the product series as part of that as a means to just de-risk the transaction somewhat. And again, in California you've seen price appreciation where you can generate some significant value.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Carl.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","I won't ask about demand, I'll ask about margins for a second. Given the guide for Q4 relative to Q3 sort of that anti-seasonal decline, you talked about lumber, Ryan, can you talk at all about other materials, specifically ones that might be impacted by tariffs beyond lumber tariffs or anything related to labor cost that might be impacting that number or that you might be controlling particularly well and any change there in availability or cost of labor that's meaningful?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Carl, you've got Bob here.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Hey, Bob.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Certainly, the cost environment is one we're paying a lot of attention to. Our purchasing teams do a really good job of trying to do two things; one, buy as efficiently as possible and then to try and protect our pricing. We highlighted that lumber will influence our sequential margins because the pricing increases that we saw and exceedingly high prices that we saw until recently will come into our Q4 production pipeline because of the way we buy lumber.","In terms of the labor market, no real changes there, again I think we do a nice job of making sure we've got multiple trades and multiple sources for most of our things so that we can at least work to try and minimize any pricing pressures there. With respect to tariffs, I guess what I would point to is in terms of what would impact us, steel obviously is something that is a contributor to our cost base, it's not obviously the biggest and that one we'll probably feel some but on the appliance side we've got long-term contracts that we think protect us from much of that pricing impact.","Cabinets is another one with Chinese production. What we're seeing is some of the producers are already starting to source that from other parts of the world. So we don't think that will have a meaningful impact on us over time. And it's interesting, if you think about what's happened in the lumber market, we had the 20% tariffs last year, that's already reflected in the pricing. And I guess, on a relative basis, the good news is we came into the year saying, hey, with think that lumber pricing will turn down on the normal seasonal pattern and it didn't, but it finally did. So we're starting to see some relief there. That won't influence our production until next year, but again on a relative basis, could provide us some tailwind in 2019.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Okay, thanks for that detail, Bob. And then I just want to ask about California and there's a lot of moving parts there. Can you give me a sense sort of, say, over the course of the next year or so, how will mix change geographically? It sounds like Sacramento, Fresno kind of come out but from a price point\/buyer segment plus location, inland versus coastal, I mean I'm just trying to get a sense of whether or not that mix of communities is going to change a lot over the course of the next year, if you could just help me a little bit with that, I would appreciate it. Thanks.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Carl, I think you'll see our mix in California as we move from current mix to next year that mix is going to stay relatively stable. I'll start with our Northern California business. We have moved that business predominantly coastal, near the jobs. I mentioned Fresno and Sacramento we've moved out of. We did have sales there last year, so going forward that business is predominantly going to be a coastal business. In Southern California where about a 30% coastal, 70% Inland Empire business, I'd expect that to remain relatively stable as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start out on a couple of additional demand questions asked a slightly different way. One thing I'm curious about, you cited the option premiums, lot premiums in the quarter on deliveries. As you're getting through the process with buyers who are under contract getting closer to close, is there anything you can give us as far as whether you're getting any forward looking sense on if this affordability issue is starting to create some deceleration and what buyers are choosing in terms of option packages and also on the mortgage side, are you seeing any discernible shift towards ARMs?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, I'll start with your first question. I'll let Bob handle the mortgage question. The only thing that I'd probably point to with buyers as they become pinched on price, they'll typically take a slightly smaller footprint. We have not seen them necessarily take fewer options in the home. I still think that they want the things that they want. They're working to find ways to afford those things. Potentially they take a lower lot premium. They don't take the water view. They may take something that's got a lower price tag from a lot premium standpoint. So as Bob detailed in his commentary, we actually saw increases in both things quarter-over-quarter, so we haven't seen a deceleration in the increases on those items. And I'll let Bob handle the arm comment or question.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Essentially, we have not seen a substantive change in that. And I think it's because we've got a perceived rising rate environment. People are not typically going to do that unless they just can't afford not to. They need to get the cheaper rate, but in the most recent quarter, 6% of our volume, the mortgages that we originated were ARMs for comparison that was 5.7% in the second quarter of last year. What we have seen though is people are locking a little bit earlier, so we've seen our rate locks at 60 and 75 days increase as a relative proportion of the number of mortgages we're doing, so people are paying attention to rate for sure.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And Ryan, I guess, I was referring to hopefully some color on just not the closings that occurred in the quarter, but what the backlog or how the backlog is shaping up as it relates to the option packages and premiums going forward, but the second question. Oh, sorry go on.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, I'll let you ask the second question, but we haven't seen a change in there. And as far as kind of our margin profile that's holding steady which I think is part of the reason that you saw us take our guide up for the back half of the year which would, I think, be the best indicator to say, no, we're not seeing a change.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","And go ahead with the second question.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Second question was really specifically around Texas because you've covered all of the country in terms of some of your commentary, but curious there was some deceleration in Texas. Could you walk us through the footprint a little bit more and kind of broken out by major markets, what you're seeing there if there is any real variation?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, the one that I would highlight is Houston, Mike. The other three markets that we operate in, I think, performed according to our expectations. Houston is the one that I think we've seen some change there. The only thing that I can really point to is that it's a city that went through one of the worst floods and hurricanes that the city and that country has seen in probably a hundred years. I think it's creating some prolonged entitlement and development timelines for new communities. I think the city is still kind of wrestling and working through some of the damaged homes and the impact that that has on overall supply. The economy there is healthy. It's a healthy economy. So beyond kind of the legacy impacts of the storm, I'm not sure that I can point to any reason why we would have seen softness there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi, Susan.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","The first thing I wanted to dig a little bit into is the comments around the traffic to your website. I guess, leading to May, was there anything that changed that would have sort of indicated that buyers were pulling back a bit. And then along with that you commented that it's been strong, but is there anything in terms of the amount of time they're spending on the site or the number of visits or what they're looking for? Any kind of nuances within that that you can share with us?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","No, Susan, nothing that we found to be meaningful to be a predictor, an indicator of current or future demand. Traffic has been strong. The year-over-year increases are up. So we're driving more traffic to the website today than we were a year ago, so overall positive. We're seeing that same trend continue with the conversion of traffic units to the website that's translating into increased traffic into the sales offices and those are some of the things that we pay particularly close attention to is to see what that conversion rate is from the time folks spend on the website and how that translates into foot traffic.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you. And then, you commented that your new active adult plans you're currently testing those and that's continuing to move along. But I guess is there anything there, as we think about the need to drive value just broadly and especially maybe with the first time or the entry level kind of buyer that you can eventually take from your active adult communities and maybe roll out to other parts of your business?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Well, not really. Those floor plans \u2013 at a broad level I'd say that those floor plans are specifically designed with that buyer in mind. We have similar types of efforts though under our commonly managed platform where we're doing the same consumer research for our entry level buyers, for our move-up buyers. It's just the significance of highlighting the new active adult floor plans. That was the first buyer group that we designed consumer inspired commonly managed plans for and we stated all the way back when we started the program that we would create obsolescence, if you will, and every four to five years come out with the next generation of plans and that's what you're seeing with our active adult plans right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel from B. Riley FBR.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you. I just wanted to confirm, your order activity for first time buyers was soft. Did this buyer group rebound in June like the rest of the business?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Alex, as I said, we saw overall improvement in the business. Isolated into one buyer group, we haven't given that commentary, but we did see June better than May, still not great and we've seen July improve again, but probably still a little short of where we would have normally expected it to be.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay. And you discussed Pulte holding pricing? Are you seeing any of your competition that is not holding pricing at this time?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Well, one of the questions that I answered earlier where we're seeing folks not hold pricing are the builders that have more inventory on the ground. It's expensive to hold inventory. You've got a lot of capital tied up into it. There's a lot of ancillary expenses associated with finished inventory, so that's where the discounts have traditionally gone and that's what we're seeing. We are seeing a few competitors start to do some national sales which I think is indicative of too much inventory and they need to move it. We're not in that position by design. It's not the way that we've chosen to run our business and so it's one of the things that allows us to hold our pricing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. A quick question on the land spend. I think you guys are targeting up 10% for the full year. Should we read that as some sort of \u2013 would that be a reasonable proxy for how you think about community count for 2019?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Buck, it's a little early to be talking about community count for 2019. We'll provide guidance on that and, broadly, I think the answer to that is no. You can't read into that because option versus raw, finished. There is a lot of things that factor into that and we'll give you some color on that in the fourth quarter.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And with the raised cash flow expectations for the full year, what's your first priority for where that incremental $200 million is going to this year?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question. I think, I'd point you back to the capital allocation that we laid out in 2014. First and foremost, if we feel good about the business, we're going to invest in the business. We want to pay our dividend. We would then use excess capital to buyback stock. The one thing I might add to that now is in a rising interest rate environment we might look at our debt if we thought that that was an attractive investment. And so the one thing I can promise is we'll be thoughtful about how we use that money.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I appreciate everybody's time this morning.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Savannah, and good morning. I'm pleased to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today.","PulteGroup's second quarter earnings were impacted by several significant items, which are noted in our earnings release. As part of the call, we will be discussing our reported results, as well as certain aspects of our business as adjusted to exclude the impact of these significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our Q2 results.","Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's second quarter operating and financial results. Building on the strength and momentum of Q1, the company's results show a continuation of strong demand and even a slight acceleration in the business.","Starting right at the top, our 12% growth in orders reflects both a strong demand environment and the increased investment we've made in the business. Given our emphasis on building to order, starting limited specs and our expanding share among higher price points, being able to accelerate from a year-over-year order increase of 8% in Q1 to 12% in Q2 surely reflects the strength of the underlying business.","We also reported 12% growth in second quarter revenues, which supported an even more significant 27% increase in adjusting earnings of $0.47 per share. The leverage in earnings per share came in the form of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, coupled with a 10% reduction in share count, resulting from our ongoing repurchase program. However, it can't just be about driving growth for growth sake. We are seeking to grow intelligently, which I believe we're demonstrating as evidenced by the 140 basis point increase in ROE to 12.8% that we realized for the trailing 12 months. And with the backlog at $4.5 billion, our highest in a decade I might add, we are extremely well positioned to continue delivering strong operating and financial performance going forward.","Our Q2 results clearly demonstrate the great progress we're making to grow our business, while delivering value to our shareholders. As pleased as I am with our growth and the strength of our quarterly results, I actually do want to address the earnings charge that we recorded in Q2 relating to our decision to address specific non-core or underperforming land assets. I note this charge because the decision to dispose of these assets is representative of positive changes taking place within PulteGroup.","Our long-term focus remains on intelligently growing our business, while delivering high returns over the housing cycle. In the process, we are taking actions that we believe can allow us to seize on market opportunities, to drive more efficient operations and to reduce risk within the business. Electing to dispose of these underperforming land assets is a great example of the comprehensive approach we are taking. After a thorough assessment of our entire land pipeline, we identified these 5,000 lots for disposal.","I would note that all, but 80 of these lots were put under control at least 10 years ago. And while no one likes having to take a charge, eliminating these positions allows us to recoup funds, to redeploy into high returning projects. At the same time, these decisions will directionally help to accelerate inventory turns and shorten our land pipeline, moving another step closer toward our goal of owning three years of land. Disposing of these lots is in alignment with our return focus, and it's an important step for us to take.","In a similar vein, we are working with our local operations to ensure they are considering market share opportunities among all buyer segments. In recent years, our return-based underwriting process has focused our investments towards serving move-up buyers. This is a market position that's worked well for the business and, in turn, our shareholders.","I believe, however, that building a business that is better balanced across the buyer groups can help to generate more growth, create a more diversified and lower risk business and yield greater local market share, each of which are points of emphasis for me. And while the current housing cycle is advancing to where all buyer groups are more actively involved, we are seeing opportunities to invest in high returning projects across all buyer categories. It'll be a multi-year process to realize a material shift in the mix of our business, but I want to make sure we're assessing all the opportunities to grow and diversify our operations as appropriate, of course, in each of the markets that we serve.","And as our 2017 year-to-date results clearly demonstrate, we are succeeding in our efforts to realize greater leverage of our overhead spend. Our current results reflect the benefits of actions taken to run a more efficient operation. We're pleased with the progress made, but I believe there are additional opportunities for us to further leverage our overheads through scale and incremental efficiency.","Finally, looking beyond our company-specific numbers, we continue to see positive buyer sentiment and generally improving demand trends across our markets. Driven in part by an expansion of the first-time buyer segment, housing demand is supported by a variety of positive factors, including an improving economy with low unemployment, high consumer confidence, low interest rates and supportive demographics. Given this backdrop, we remain constructive on the market and the potential for several more years of growth in overall housing demand.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a more thorough review of our second quarter results.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate the continued growth and overall strong financial performance of our business. As reported in this morning's release and mentioned by Jim, our reported Q2 results were impacted by several significant items that were recorded in the period. We spoke to these items in the release and provided a non-GAAP reconciliation table with the financials. But I think it'll be helpful for me to quickly walk through the items and highlight which income statement lines they impact.","First, our decision to dispose of certain non-core land assets resulted in a charge of approximately $121 million, which breaks down as follows; $31.5 million of land impairment that is reflected in home sale cost of revenues, $81 million of net realizable value adjustments that are reflected in landfill cost of revenues, and $8 million of impairments of land held in a joint venture that is reflected in other expense, net.","Second, we recorded a $12.1 million charge to home sale cost of revenues for warranty work associated with a construction claim at a closed community in Florida. As costs associated with this claim had previously been recorded in our construction defect reserves, we reversed $19.8 million of reserves that were directly attributable to this claim, including the development of incurred, but not reported claim activity. The benefit of this reversal is reflected as a reduction of SG&A.","And finally, we recorded a net benefit of $23.8 million in our income tax expense line, resulting primarily from tax law changes and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding this benefit, the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 37%. I'll note the impact of these items as appropriate over the remainder of my comments.","Let me now begin the review of our Q2 results. In the second quarter, our net new orders totaled 6,395 homes, which represents a 12% increase over the prior year. On an absolute basis, orders for the quarter showed gains across all buyer groups, as first-time orders were up 6% to 1,929 homes, move-up orders were up 21% to 2,931 homes, and active adult orders were up 6% to 1,535 homes. The growth in Q2 orders is consistent with our view that we continue to operate in a favorable demand environment.","Adjusting for community count, our absorptions were down 2% compared with the last year, but at 2.7 sales per community per month remain at very healthy paces. Reported absorptions, particularly among our first-time buyers, is being influenced by the 2016 closeout of some high-volume communities, along with the ongoing mix shift in our business towards higher price points.","Reflecting the strength of our business, we continue to generate significant growth as our second quarter home sale revenues gained 12% over last year to $2 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect an increase of 6% or $23,000 in average sale price to $390,000, combined with a 6% increase in closing volume to 5,044 homes. Total deliveries for the quarter were consistent with our prior guidance.","Looking at Q2 closings by buyer group, 29% were first-time, 47% were move-up, and 24% were active adults. This compares to 30% first-time, 43% move-up, and 27% active adult last year. At the end of the second quarter, the company had a total of 9,588 homes under construction, of which we expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,600 homes in the third quarter. This would represent closing volume growth of between 8% and 12% over the prior year.","As I indicated, our average sales price for the second quarter was up 6% from last year to $390,000. The higher closing ASP reflects the ongoing growth of our move-up business, along with higher prices being realized in each buyer group. For the quarter, average sales prices of first-time buyers increased 11% over the prior year to $291,000, move-up increased 2% to $457,000, and active adult was up 6% to $379,000.","Average sales price in backlog also continues to rise, as backlog ASP gained 8% to $418,000, keeping us on track to achieve our previous guidance of full year ASPs above $400,000. As I mentioned, the $31.5 million charge for land impairments and the $12.1 million warranty charge were recorded in Homebuilding cost of revenues. Inclusive of these charges, our reported gross margin for the second quarter was 21.1%. Excluding the impact of these charges, our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 23.4%, which is 10 basis points below our guidance range.","Margin performance continues to benefit from higher option revenues and lot premiums, which increased 12% or $8,100 over last year's $75,300 per home. However, sales discounts in the quarter increased 80 basis points over last year and 20 basis points over Q1 to 3.5% of gross sales price or $14,000 per home. The increase in discounts primarily reflects the actions being taken among the higher price points in select markets, where there's more inventory and consumers have more choices.","We believe it is important that we keep our prices competitive to ensure we are turning our assets efficiently. Within this pricing dynamic, we still expect to realize meaningful sequential margin improvement of 20 to 70 basis points and resulting gross margins in the range of 23.6% to 24.1% for both the third and fourth quarters. Full year gross margin is now expected to be approximately 23.7% for the year. This guidance excludes the impact of the significant items recognized during the second quarter. Consistent with our focus on delivering strong operating margins, we continue to make outstanding progress on controlling overhead expenses in the business.","For the quarter, our reported SG&A spend of $216 million, or 11% of home sale revenues, reflects the $19.8 million insurance reserve reversal. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was $236 million or 12% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A for the second quarter was $256 million or 14.6% of home sale revenues.","Based on the disciplined execution of our cost reduction efforts and our expectations for spending over the balance of the year, we are updating our SG&A guidance and now project that our full year 2017 SG&A will be in the range of 11.7% to 12% of revenues compared with our previous guidance of 12% to 12.5%. This guidance also excludes the impact of the significant items recognized in the first two quarters of this year.","Adjusting for the significant items in the quarter, our operating margin was 11.4%, which represents an 80 basis point increase compared to last year, as lower SG&A expense more than offset the decline in our margins. Given expectations for margin performance in the back half of the year and our projected sustained 2017 SG&A leverage, we now expect operating margin for the year to be in the range of 11.7% to 12%. To ensure we tie in all the adjustments in the quarter, we generated land sale revenues of $8 million and land sale cost of revenues of $87.6 million, which includes the $81 million charge relating to the land assets we are planning to sell.","Turning to our Financial Services businesses. Pre-tax income for the second quarter was $19 million, an increase of 11% over the second quarter of 2016. The increase in pre-tax was primarily the result of higher closing volumes in our Homebuilding operations and an increase in the average size of the loans we originated. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 79% compared with 81% last year.","Continuing down the income statement, we recorded other expense totaling $16 million, up from $13 million last year. The increase was due primarily to the $8 million impairment of land held in a joint venture. Other expense in Q2 2016 included $15 million of costs related to the termination of certain land transactions and final costs associated with our corporate relocation.","Reported pre-tax income for the second quarter was $123 million compared with $190 million last year. Adjusted pre-tax income for the quarter was $235 million, which represents an increase of 15% from the $204 million of adjusted pre-tax income last year. Our reported income tax expense for the quarter was $22 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 17.8%.","Our tax rate for the quarter included the $24 million of tax benefits I noted earlier. Excluding these items, the company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 37%, which is consistent with our current expectation for the full year. Reported net income for the second quarter was $101 million or $0.32 per share, compared with reported net income for the prior year's second quarter of $118 million or $0.34 per share.","On an adjusted basis, net income for the second quarter was $148 million or $0.47 per share, up 27% on a per share basis from adjusted net income of $127 million or $0.37 per share last year. Our Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was calculated using approximately 314 million shares, which is a decrease of 34 million shares or 10% from 2016, due primarily to share repurchase activities.","Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $240 million of cash, after having used $300 million to repurchase 12.8 million common shares during the quarter at an average price of $23.42 per share. For the year, the company has repurchased $400 million of common shares and has $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. As always, our decision to repurchase shares is subject to overall business and financial market conditions.","The reduction in equity following our share repurchases in the second quarter increased our debt-to-capital ratio to 41%, which is just outside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%. At present, we anticipate ending 2017 slightly above 40%, but expect that future earnings will move us back inside our range. As noted earlier, we ended the second quarter with 9,588 homes under construction, which is up approximately 900 homes or 10% over last year. The increase is driven primarily by higher sold backlog units. Consistent with our focus on controlling our spec production, we ended the quarter with fewer than 500 finished spec homes on the ground.","Community count for the quarter was 803, as the slow closeout of certain communities resulted in elevated community count relative to guidance. However, we still expect to end 2017 with year-over-year growth in community count in the range of 5% to 10%. In the second quarter, we invested approximately $236 million for the acquisition of new land positions. We approved deals representing approximately 7,000 lots in the quarter, of which 33% were optioned. Average deal size in the quarter was a little bit bigger at 130 \u2013 150 lots per community, including one new Del Webb position.","And finally, we ended Q2 with 89,700 lots owned and 42,500 lots held under option. This moves the mix of lots controlled via option up to 32%, while lowering our years of owned lots to less than 4.4 years.","Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. With the low interest rate environment helping first-time buyer demand, along with supportive economic and demographic trends, we're positive on housing demand over the near and mid-term. We fully appreciate, however, that the economic and housing recoveries are getting long by historic standards, so we remain disciplined in how and where we're investing our capital and how we run our operations day to day.","As sign-ups in the quarter and for the first half of 2017 demonstrate, we continue to operate within favorable demand conditions. At a high level, the market conditions we experienced during the quarter were as follows. Demand in our Northeast, Southeast and Florida markets was strong throughout the quarter, although as I mentioned, higher price points in some markets are increasingly competitive. Still, we've been very pleased with the traffic and conversion rates in these areas in the first half of the year.","We continue to see very good buyer demand in our Midwest and Texas markets. Texas, in particular, is doing well and this includes Houston, which continues to deliver consistent traffic in the face of volatile conditions for the oil industry. And out West, demand conditions are still very strong across essentially all of the geographies, with notable strength in Nevada, Northern California and Arizona. Nevada's results include the opening of Reverence, a community of almost 900 home sites in the Summerlin master plan, which experienced exceptional demand when it grand opened in early June.","Looking into the third quarter, demand in the first few weeks of July has demonstrated nominal seasonal patterns consistent with the positive environment we operated in the first and second quarters of 2017. We've had a great start to the year, and I want to thank our employees who've made that happen. They've done a superb job in delivering both an exceptional experience to our homebuyers and excellent financial results for our shareholders.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Ryan. We will now open the call for questions, so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Savannah, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks. So, yeah, first I just wanted to ask about the gross margins. They're pretty close to the range in the second quarter, but you mentioned that the trends in the back half might be a little bit lower than you'd previously expected. Just wondering if you could just break down the drivers for us, and specifically I was looking for where \u2013 which division has the compression or which brand has the compression come in? And you mentioned a little bit of the higher price points, some pricing pressures in the second quarter, and maybe if you can tie that and how much that's affecting the second half as well, please.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Nishu, this is Ryan. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how the business is performing. We like the current operating environment that we're in. As I think Bob noted, we're seeing nice margin improvement as we move throughout the year. We saw sequential improvement moving from Q1 to Q2, and we anticipate that to continue into the back half of the year. So, I think that's representative and indicative of the favorable market dynamics that we're currently operating in.","As it relates to some of the margin compression that we alluded to, we saw an incremental amount of discounting as we moved from Q1 to Q2, somewhere in the order of about 20 basis points. So, it was enough to move the needle a bit. But by no means what I overreact to it and it was \u2013 as far as the brands go, it was in the Pulte brands, which is typically where our higher price points, that's the brand that we house our higher price points in. It was a few specific communities in a couple of markets within the Southeast part of the United States. So, again, I just reiterate how positive we are on the market and the strength that we're seeing with the overall margin profile of the business.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Thank you. And on absorptions, if your community count had, I think, come in closer to what the expectations had been and some of those slower sell-out communities had sold out as scheduled, the absorptions would have looked a little bit better than expected, I believe. And so looking forward, as some of these committees begin to sell out, does that imply maybe the potential for some absorption bump on an overall basis? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Nishu, this is Ryan again. Certainly the numbers that you've got in the numerator and the denominator, when it comes to community absorptions, it can really move the numbers. We have had some slower closeouts of some communities that we thought would have been gone by now. And we're working to move through those. And as Bob indicated, our expectation is that they'll be gone by the end of the year, and our community count guide will be in that 5% to 10% range year-over-year that we'd previously provided.","Just to give you an idea of how sensitive it can be, when I went in and I looked at the detail of what was going on with our committee counts, we had, as an example, four communities that had a grand total of about eight sign-ups. If you took those four communities out of the numerator and the denominator, our per community absorptions would have essentially been flat. Again, I'd talk about the strength of the overall business, the 12% order growth that we saw in the second quarter was really strong. We're very pleased with that. And as Bob noted in his prepared remarks, at overall community absorptions of 2.7 per community, we like how the business is running.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Lovallo from Bank of America.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, I guess, would be on the SG&A performance in the quarter, which was much better than what we were expecting. Can you maybe help us think about some of the major kind of drivers in the quarter? Was there anything quirky in the adjusted SG&A number of $236 million? And then, I would have thought that maybe there could have been a little bit more upside in the outlook for SG&A. What's driving kind of the increase in the back half? Is it just community count? Or is there anything else going on?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, John, this is Ryan. I'll give you just a couple of pieces and then I'll let Bob give you some incremental color on some of the details. But as far as what was in the adjusted numbers, no, the adjusted numbers, there's nothing quirky or unusual. It's reflective of the changes that we made really starting in the back half of last year, and that's continued to be a focus for our entire organization to run an efficient shop.","As we move through the back half of the year, the increase will be completely aligned with the new opening of some of our new stores. We talked about before, we open about 250 new home \u2013 new communities a year, and the incremental spend will really be associated with the grand opening type activities that have slightly elevated SG&A, one-time expenses that are mashed up with those new communities.","But other than that, we continue to be on the same trend line and the same level of efficiency that we've been on for the previous three quarters, and that's reflective of the full year guidance that we've provided. We had been operating in a 12% to 12.5% target. We're quite confident in the progress that we're making, and so we've improved and updated what that overall guide is for the full year, to that 11.7% to 12% range.","So, I'll ask \u2013 maybe Bob can give you maybe just a tad bit more color on some of the details on the SG&A number.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","No, I wouldn't add anything. The only thing, obviously, since we've got commissions there, you've got more seasonal influence on the SG&A, so we'll have more \u2013 as we close more in the back half of the year, you'll have more commission expense and that's reflected on top of, as Ryan pointed out, the community activity.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, Ryan, in terms of your comments, making sure the business is addressing kind of all segments, I would assume that it's been perhaps moving a little bit more into entry level. Is that correct? And if so, does that mean kind of investing more in Centex? Or is there another strategy that you guys are thinking about?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. John, certainly, Centex is a big component of our first-time buyer business, but we've talked for the last several years about really looking at the first-time buyer could include our millennials, which in some cases we market to under our Pulte brand. So, some combination of Centex and Pulte targeted toward the first-time buyer and the entry-level segment.","We are maintaining and sticking true to our underwriting criteria of investing, making investment decisions based on where we can drive the best return on invested capital for our shareholder, while balancing the overall risk profile that we're looking for. As we entered into the recovery two or three years ago, as I commented in my prepared remarks, that strategy really led us to more investment in the move-up buyer and, look, I think today's results are reflective of how beneficial that's been to our overall business profile, but as we move forward and today as the market continues to recovery, we're seeing opportunities to serve all buyer groups. And not only is buyer behavior reflective of that, the returns that we can underwrite to are supportive of that as well.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hi.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, going back to the SG&A for a moment, continued progress there, and I think second time you've lowered the range expected for the year. And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's on a \u2013 your revenue expectations, broadly speaking, have remained pretty consistent. So, I was hoping to get a little help on just what's driving that incremental efficiency. Are there just better-than-expected cost takeouts? Or on a community level, are things a little more efficient? And where would you see over the next two or three years that number arriving at?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Mike, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. So, it's really in three main categories. We made some changes to the level of personnel that we are running the operation with in the back half of last year. We've been able to then change some of our processes that have allowed us to run a very efficient business with that level of personnel. So, not a surprise, the majority of our spend is in our people. So, a lot of the savings has come from that. We've also been able to maintain some nice efficiency at the subdivision level with the amount of money that we spend to run our individual subdivisions. We had a lot of cost-saving measures and process changes directed at that.","And finally, I would tell you, and really give kudos to our marketing team. Our marketing team has done some really nice things with our digital marketing efforts to drive efficiency of spend there and improve our conversion rate when folks actually cross the threshold of our stores. We're seeing some nice improvements in overall conversion rates, which has given us great efficiency in the marketing dollars. So, those are the three probably big categories that I'd highlight.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Mike, the only thing I'd add is in terms of the improvement versus where we had set expectations, we had put these plans in place, but we candidly weren't sure exactly how quickly they would take hold. And to Ryan's point, we've made outstanding progress. And so we've been able to tighten the range. In terms of going forward, we'll give some color on that when we provide guidance for next year.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, Bob. And I guess just then going back to the gross margin for a moment, I did find it encouraging that you kind of said it was more limited to a few communities and a couple of markets in the Southeast at higher price points. So, from a geographic standpoint, are we to just interpret that? And I'd be curious if you're able to give us color on which markets those were in the Southeast. But as a result, you're saying the broad swath of your remaining geography incentives and pricing patterns were essentially more stable, is that fair to say?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Mike. I think that's an appropriate characterization. The Northeast is an area that remains competitive, where our business is performing essentially in line with our expectations, but it is competitive. And I would characterize the balance of the country as strong. I highlighted the Texas markets. I highlighted the Midwest. I highlighted the West. Those are all some places where we're seeing nice strength.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just lastly, real quick, sales pace by customer segment, I think it's something you've given out in the past, just the change for the quarter. Thank you.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. So, we were \u2013 absorptions were 3.4 per month at the first-time level, 2.1 for the move-up and 3.5, so on a comparative basis, down 6% on the first time, up 1% and up 1% on the move-up and active adult, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Dahl from Barclays.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. As I know that specs aren't as much of a part of your strategy as for some others, but I was hoping you could give us some color on just how the spec margins looked in this quarter versus dirt? And how does that compare to the first quarter and maybe late 2016?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. We typically haven't given that level of detail. We can try and get you some stuff offline.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. I guess what I'm trying to get at is another way of attacking the pricing angle, and maybe back to the prior comment on the balance of the markets being strong. Would you characterize it as kind of price-cost relationship, ex these couple of markets that you've talked about as being more challenged? Has that relationship improved relative to what you were seeing in the first quarter? Or is it about the same as far as what you're seeing?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","I think \u2013 I apologize, Mike, I might be answering the wrong question here. But our view forward with sequential margin improvement would tell you, I think, that the price-to-cost profile is pretty favorable right now. And obviously, the closings that we have in Q3 and Q4 are going to be the sales that we reported in Q1 and Q2.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. You're crushing in on the SG&A, it's really nice to see.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Bob. How are you this morning?","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Pretty good, sir. Nice to talk with you.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Likewise.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just wanted to ask you, it sounds like a lot of operational progress, good visibility, Bob's tightening up the range, which is great to see. Nobody's talking about your land program of getting down to kind of, like, six years of supply split between options and owned lots. I was hoping you'd just spend a minute and go big picture a little bit and talk about the land strategy at this point in the cycle. And how you're adapting the strategy to drive return on invested capital? And I was also hoping you could give a little bit of view on how your land purchasing is evolving versus some of the long-dated assets you have on the balance sheet. How should we be thinking about this?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Bob, did I get three questions in one there?","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I was trying to beat Mike Rehaut, no.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Got it. All right. Well, let me see if I can address all of those. So, we are very focused on improving the efficiency of our land portfolio, and it's something that I outlined in some of my very first commentary once I came into the role in September of last year. We have put the three years owned and three years optioned target out there, it's something that I think we're continuing to make progress against as indicated by the current land inventory that we have right now.","One of the big things that we did is, we took the comprehensive look at our entire land portfolio, and that is part of what drove the actions that we took in the second quarter with the book of assets that we intend to move through. So, that certainly was a big step in the right direction to get our land portfolio moving the right way.","The second piece is, what are we underwriting at today? And, Bob, I would suggest and share with you that over the last three or four years under our underwriting criteria, the average lot size of communities that we've been buying has been in the 120 lot per transaction range. When we're running at about 35 or so absorptions per community per year, that's right about that three-year average. And you mix in the options and some of those kind of things, and we're very much moving in the path where we want to go.","Now the difference is essentially the long-dated or the bigger Del Webb communities that we have that are performing very well, but as we've talked about quite a bit in the past, there's a little bit more land there. It's going to take some time. But we like where we're going, we're at 4.4 today versus eight years, not too long ago. So, pretty dramatic improvement in a pretty short period of time, and I like the trajectory of where we're going.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And just for my second question, Bob, could you maybe talk about \u2013 in concert with the land program in place, you're finishing out your capital spending program on share repurchase, for $1.5 billion, this $300 million in buyback is pretty solid this quarter. How should we be thinking, in not just this year but for 2018, about capital allocation with any free cash flow? Thanks, and good luck.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Yeah. No change on the capital allocation front, candidly. We've highlighted that we're targeting $1 billion. We've got $600 million left to get there. We've got that authorization in place. We always think about market conditions when we look at that, but obviously we bought a pretty big slug of stock in this second quarter, reflective of the cash position and the strength of the balance sheet coming into it. So, really no change.","In terms of forward capital allocation, I think the process that we laid out back in, gosh, December of 2014, remains today the way we look at it. So, as long as we're constructive on the market, I know you've heard me say this before, we're going to invest in the business first and foremost. We're then going to pay our dividend, then we would look to buy back stock with any excess capital, all subject to that 30% to 40% debt to cap. We're a little bit outside that range today. Again, our expectation is that earnings will pull us back inside of that 40% target.","So, in that mindset, we'll look at 2018 and beyond. We plan for multiple years, and we'll look at what the business generates, what we see in terms of opportunities, and you heard Ryan talk about the opportunities we're seeing across demographic and geographic markets. So, we're building our plans now. And in terms of capital, it means we're refreshing that which we already created. And we'll give more color on what we think we'll do in 2018 as we give our guidance with our fourth quarter earnings release.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much guys. Really a strong quarter on the SG&A, let me just add my congratulations there. I didn't hear you all mention land spend number, maybe I missed it, but I was wondering could you give us the acquisition and development spend in the quarter.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Stephen. So, for the quarter, acquisition was $236 million, development was $373 million, so $609 million in total. That brings the total for the year to just under $500 million for acq and just under $700 million for development.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Okay. That's a kind of a tight number which will be consistent with your view. So, okay, thanks for that. I guess, I had a few questions, but let me just go head and just boil it down to one. Recently, there's been some action by one of your larger competitors on the land front in terms of getting in front of an approaching constraint in land development as they see it, maybe some partners on the land development side and the land financing side. And was curious as to your thoughts regarding both the impetus for driving interest in something like that as well as maybe something about that particular kind of structure as you've looked at that from afar.","And then secondly, another one of your competitors has been pretty active in terms of making investments on the technology front. And so, I was wondering if you could sort of address those two areas of strategic thinking and positioning as you look ahead over the next couple of years. If you can maybe address just your \u2013 how you size up the landscape and what your response to that is?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Stephen, good morning. This is Ryan. Let me take maybe the first question for \u2013 the first question you asked about a couple of the things on the land front that one of our competitors is doing. I certainly don't have the inside information or baseball. I've read a lot of the things that are out there about the transaction. I certainly think it's interesting. Probably tough for me to comment on exactly what their strategy is and what they're trying to accomplish on it.","Land is certainly a challenge that all builders face, and that is essentially the number one raw material that we need to continue to run our business. And so we are, like all of our competitors, looking to gain a competitive edge in how we acquire, entitle and develop raw land. So, time will tell, I think, on how that works out.","We do put a lot of emphasis on acquisition talent and specifically entitlement talent. And those are things where we can really add value to the overall land pipeline that we're acquiring. So, I think we've got a really talented land team, and I think we're doing as good a job as any of our competitors when it comes to that front.","As far as technology goes, Stephen, we're making significant investments in technology. There is a number of things that we're doing with how we run our business, whether it's on the way we market and run our website and the way that we're reaching out to our customers, there are certainly investments in technology that we're making there. We recently launched a updated new website in the last six or so months, and we're happy with how that's performing.","We're doing a number of things in the way that we're building our homes, purchasing systems or things that we're looking to enhance our technology on, all the way down to what are the parts, pieces and components of things that we're putting into our home, making them smarter, making them more digital, allowing homeowners to have kind of control of their home, the same way they have control of many other parts of their digital lifestyle. So, it's a big beast to tackle for certain, but it's something that our entire team is focused on, and we're looking to make as many gains as we possibly can.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I appreciate all the detail on the margin and discussing what's going on in the pricing side. Two questions related to that. First on the tick-up in incentives, I'm curious if that was \u2013 if you kind of think about the handful of communities, it sounds like those occurred in, was that more in response to actions taken by competitors that you kind of had to match in order to maintain a sales pace? Or is that some actions maybe you're taking proactively to jump-start some activity in maybe some of those underperforming communities?","And then the second follow-up to that, just on the cost side, there wasn't a whole lot of conversation about what you're seeing on costs. Curious how that's trending both materials and labor. And then just broadly in your conversations with the trades, how do you feel the labor environment is situated as we head into the back half of the year? We had a good selling season, obviously. Do you think the labor \u2013 the trades are really in a good position to get those homes built and delivered before year-end? Thank you.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Alan, thanks for the questions. Let me take the incentive question first. Not \u2013 I would tell you it's not an overreaction to anything. We're constantly evaluating the competitive environment that we're in and the inventory that we have in our pipeline, and we felt like there was an opportunity to be a bit more competitive. As an aside, you probably noted in some of Bob's comments, our finished inventory came down from prior quarter. And so certainly, I think some of those incremental incentives helped to move through some finished inventory that we had. Nothing that we did \u2013 we're looking at \u2013 we're always looking at the competitive environment, including our other competitors and you've got to be responsive to that, but not any kind of a significant trend that I would point to.","And then on the cost front, we've previously provided guidance that our cost estimates were in the 1.5% to 2% range. We're still operating within that range. Labor is the piece that is getting tighter and \u2013 or is running a little hotter, which would arguably push us to the higher end of that 1.5 to 2 points, especially as we move into the back half of the year. As you mentioned, it's been a strong selling season, there's a lot of volume in the system. While we've seen some nice gains in labor, labor is still the piece that remains tight.","On the commodity side, concrete and lumber are the two pieces that I would point to. Concrete is not something that we can buy at a national level, it's typically something that we're acquiring at a regional level, at best. And then, on the lumber side, we had the Canadian lumber tariff in the first quarter. And then in current time, there're a number of forest fires in the Canadian province that are creating some logistical challenges with the mills. Our expectation is that'll continue to put some pressure on the back half as well, which will push us to the higher end of that 1.5 to 2 points we've been operating in.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","I appreciate that, Ryan. So, just to be clear then, it sounds like at least part of the revised view on the margins is probably somewhat cost driven as well.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Correct.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Stephen East from Wells Fargo.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning guys. Ryan, you've been in your job roughly a year give or take now and as you look at the company versus maybe your vision, where do you think you stand with? And then as you look out over the next few years, what are your key objectives of where you want to drive the company? I mean, you've talked some about the returns and all that, but I was thinking maybe a notch below it, and what are some of the key drivers you think you need to put in place to move the company to where you want it to go.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Stephen. Thanks for the question, and what I would tell you is, it's been a great year. I think we've made tremendous progress. We've got an unbelievable company with a rich history. We've got wonderful employees that, I think, are doing just a marvelous job executing the strategy that we've laid out. Some of the tweaks that I articulated, that I wanted to see us modify and change, I wanted to see us own less land and get to a three and three mix, and I think we're clearly taking some steps in that direction.","We made a giant step with the announcement of the changes that we intended to make to our overall land portfolio in moving through some long-dated assets that frankly just didn't fit within our portfolio and weren't aligned with our current strategy. So, harvesting that cash and redeploying it into high returning projects, I think, is going to be a great step for the organization as well.","I'd like to see us be a little more balanced in the consumers that we're serving. We're making nice progress in that. I like the traction that we're getting. We've seen a slight uptick in the number of first-time and entry-level projects that we're able to invest in, which are being supported by the returns. So, everything is coming together on that front. I also really like to focus that our team has put on running a more predictable and efficient operation.","I think as evidenced by two really solid quarters of home deliveries, I like the way that our construction operation is building and getting homes closed. We've had a tremendous focus on quality and taking care of our customer. And I think that is paying us nice dividends today. It'll pay us huge dividends into the future, as our reputation continues to be enhanced and improved by really taking care of the customer, creating a great customer experience and building a superior quality home, all things that our teams are focused on.","So, Stephen, we've had great success. I'm really energized and excited about the trajectory of the company. I like the land deals that we're buying. There's a lot of real positivity happening out there in our field right now, and it's going to be an exciting ride.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. That's great. That's very helpful for me. And you look at \u2013 you've talked about demand quite a bit and, I guess, as you look at the cycle, it sounds like you all see it lasting several more years. As you look at your split between active adult, entry-level, move-up, you want to get it more balanced. How long do you think it takes you to get to where you're balanced in that?","And, I guess, involved with that has a lot to do with entry-level and how quickly you can drive it. Are you seeing most \u2013 the biggest chunk of your deals coming at entry-level today? And is mortgage availability \u2013 I guess the question is, how do you get entry-level to be a more balanced piece of your business, both the mortgage availability, the deals you're doing, the product that you're putting on the ground and the competition that's out there?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Stephen, it's going to be a multi-year journey. We're not going to swing the pendulum to the other side overnight, and nor would we want to. The intent is that we're running a balanced approach every single day and by doing that, it's going to take time to evolve the entire portfolio.","So, I think patience here is truly going to be a virtue. More so than trying to hit specific metrics and what percentage of a certain buyer group that we have, we're looking to run the best possible business that we can, drive the best return for our shareholders. And that's the playbook that, I think, we're executing quite effectively.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Stephen, the only thing I'd add to that is, to your question, are we doing more deals, yeah, we are, actually. And I think if you think of the way we've positioned the way we buy land, we seek return. The increasing velocity that we're seeing out of that buyer group makes some stuff pencil for us that didn't pencil in the past. So, we are certainly seeing some of that activity, and to Ryan's point, it will take a while. Just like it took a while for all that move-up business that we bought back in time to work its way through and it's a big shift to influence the total for the company will take some time. But, yeah, we're seeing activity with that buyer group, because they're more active.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, got you. Is mortgage availability improving there?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","I don't know that it's improving. I think you've got plenty of programs out there with low money down type activity. The QRM rules are what they are. I would argue that it was never that great a hindrance to that buyer group. There have been people who have said \u2013 a lot of them just didn't know they could qualify if they went and asked, they'd find out they could. So, I don't know that it's a big mover one way or the other. Because I think there is credit available for them when they're shopping. But price becomes an issue as it always has been for that first-time buyer.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Hi guys. How are you?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Good morning, Carl.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","I just have one question. Morning. And you've talked a lot about a mix shift move over time. When we talk about markets, obviously, you've flushed some backlog of lots that have been sitting for a while; you've exited St. Louis recently or will be. Are you thinking, Ryan, in terms of looking at your geographic market locations and beginning to thin some out and reinvest? And I think that's just tied to the comment you made earlier about leveraging local efficiencies and scale better. Would there be a chance that you would shrink your market mix and reinvest more heavily in certain markets to grow share?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Carl, what I would tell you, scale matters. And we've talked about that for a long time. And market share matters. And I think you heard a little bit of it in my prepared remarks that we're working with our local operators to shore up and make sure that our market share and our scale foundations are solid in every single market that we operate in.","If we find a market where we think we have weakness, we don't have the scale, we don't have the market share that we want, we're putting plans in place to change that. And in the event that we don't see a path forward, we will make the decision to leave the market. And I think you \u2013 that was one of the things that we saw in St. Louis. We felt that there was more opportunity to take that capital and reinvest it in other locations, but my preference would be to see us operate in as many markets as we possibly can as long as we can have scale and the appropriate market share to drive the efficiencies that we need to make our platform work.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Susan.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'm wondering if \u2013 you noted that your recent land purchases have risen to about 150 lots per community, and that's a little bit higher than the 120 that you've been targeting over the last few years or so. Can you talk to how you think about that rise relative to your focus on driving returns, focusing on the margin side of things? And perhaps what does that imply for the sales pace as we think about this looking out over time?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Susan, I think in a small subset, the numbers can be a little bit, not misleading, but can lead you to odd conclusions. We noted that there was a Del Webb in there, which was a large lot count relative to the normal deals that we do. So, we put 7,000 lots under control. A pretty big percentage of that actually came from one deal that influences it.","Similarly, you have heard us say that we have been doing a little bit more in that first-time space. With higher velocities, typically, again in a three-year deal, you're going to have a little bit larger lot count there. So, I don't think it's anything in terms of \u2013 we haven't changed our underwriting, our return criteria is still the same. It's not a margin equation for us, it's actually return. And so it's just a mix of assets that we happen to buy in this quarter.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then just thinking about the 11% increase in the price that you saw in your first-time buyer segments there, can you talk to how much of that was mix shift? And maybe how much pricing power you're actually seeing among that buyer side?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","It's hard for us to break that down in real time. I would tell you that there is pricing power there, but there is mix in that, for sure.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Zeumer, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","James P.

Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Sarah, and I'll be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our host. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer","Okay. Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to the PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our fourth quarter financial results for the 3 months ended December 31, 2013.","On the call today to discuss our results are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that copies of this morning's earnings release, along with the presentation slides that accompanies today's call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today's call will also be available on the site later today.","I also want to alert participants that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including references to gross margins after certain adjustments, are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of this morning's earnings release.","And finally, today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested on our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me call -- turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I want to start this call by saying thank you to our employees for their incredible accomplishments over the past 3 years. It is only through their efforts that we get to speak with you today about the significant gains in PulteGroup's fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance. Their willingness to embrace our Value Creation strategy and implement needed changes have been critical to improving our fundamental business performance. The realization of their hard work is again showcased in the outstanding quarterly earnings we released this morning.","We have been consistent over the past 36 months in explaining our Value Creation strategy and initiatives to improve gross margins, overhead leverage, inventory turns and ultimately return on invested capital over the housing cycle. As I will highlight and Bob will detail, we have been successful in delivering gains in each of these key metrics and more broadly, across the business. Our financial results clearly show the progress we continue to make.","For the quarter, we were able to drive a 610 basis point improvement in gross margin to 23.2%. Our adjusted margin of 27.7% represents the 12th consecutive quarter of margin expansion and is a full 190 basis points above our previous high recorded in the first quarter of 2005.","We are very proud of this accomplishment that has taken our margins from the bottom quartile in the industry just 3 years ago to among the industry leaders today. The significant gains in fourth quarter results helped to lift full year 2013 margins to 20.5%, up from 15.8% just 1 year ago. 2013 margins are also more than double our gross margins for full year 2010, which is when we started laying the groundwork for what ultimately became our Value Creation strategy, a strategy that is clearly working.","Consistent with our overall focus on operating efficiency, we were also able to improve our overhead leverage. For the full year, overhead leverage gained 80 basis points to 10.5% of revenues. On a dollar basis, SG&A for 2013 was up $54 million from last year, but this is against a year-over-year increase in homebuilding revenue exceeding $870 million. We are simply running a more efficient business and certainly, a more profitable one as we reported pretax income of $528 million for 2013, almost triple our prior year pretax income of $184 million.","In prior periods, we had discussed the potential offered by our Value Creation strategy, and I think now it's clearly evident the positive impact our actions are having on PulteGroup's operating and financial performance. What should also be increasingly clear are the opportunities we now have to capitalize on PulteGroup's improved business platform going forward. With a more efficient operating model than we had in the past, with a more supportive capital structure and with more disciplined investment processes, we can be more effective putting additional capital to work.","To that end, as part of our 2014 budgeting process, we authorized $2 billion for land-related investment. This is up from $1.3 billion invested in acquisition and development in 2013. Our decision to increase investment into the business is consistent with our view that U.S. housing continues to advance to a sustained multiyear recovery. While there are many estimates on what and when the peak of this current cycle will be reached, consensus numbers point toward the industry having several years of increasing demand ahead, a view that we share.","The fundamental market dynamics that launched and have supported the recovery in housing remain in place. Interest rates are near historic lows, although we certainly appreciate the rise in mortgage rates experienced in 2013 had an impact in the back half of the year. The inventory of homes available for sale, particularly as it relates to new homes, remains low. And home prices continue to appreciate in most markets, which helps to create a sense of urgency and confidence among buyers.","With all that being said, we still believe that the ultimate shape of the housing demand curve going forward will be impacted by broader economic conditions. More jobs and ideally better-paying jobs will be critical in driving housing demand to peak levels. Home buyer demand would also benefit from better mortgage availability, particularly for first-time buyers who have been underrepresented in the recovery so far. With major changes rolling through the system, including the recent implementation of QM rules and new leadership at the Fed and FHFA, it is difficult to assess how mortgage availability will develop in the next few quarters.","We do believe, however, that our government officials appreciate just how important housing is to a sustained economic recovery in this country.","Now with our fourth quarter earnings reported, we close out an exceptional 2013 on a very high note and enter 2014 in a strong market position and with tremendous financial flexibility.","Now let me turn the call over to Bob for more details on PulteGroup's fourth quarter results.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. Our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results build on prior gains and continue a trend of operating and financial improvements that began more than 2 years ago. We've benefited from an industry tailwind, but I think our relative performance demonstrates the incremental gains we're generating from our Value Creation initiatives.","Let me provide some details on our financial results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 9% over the prior year to $1.6 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 13% increase in average selling price to $325,000, partially offset by a 4% decrease in closings to 4,964 homes. The higher average selling price in the quarter was driven by price increases and the continuing shift in our business towards move-up and active adult homes.","For the fourth quarter, our closings break down as follows: 46% from Pulte, 32% from Del Webb and 22% from Centex. This compares to our prior year closing mix of 47% Pulte, 26% Del Webb and 27% Centex.","Looking out over the next 12 to 24 months, we would expect that our mix of closings will continue to be weighted toward move-up and active adult product as the majority of our land investment has gone into Pulte brand communities while we remain fully invested in Del Webb.","As I mentioned, our average selling price on closings was $325,000, which represents an increase of $38,000 over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher pricing across all 3 of our brands, with Pulte up 13%, Del Webb up 11% and Centex up 6%. As previously discussed, the shift in mix also contributed to the increase in our overall average selling price.","Land sales in the fourth quarter generated revenues of $12 million and pretax income of less than $1 million. In the prior year, land sale revenues were $37 million with pretax income of $4 million. As we've stated in the past, we remain opportunistic with regards to selling noncore land assets.","Our gross margin in the quarter was 23.2%, which is 610 basis points better than the prior year and 230 basis points better than Q3 of this year. Due in large part to the significant interest savings we are realizing from the deleveraging we have accomplished over the last 2 years, I'm happy to say that we feel that addressing adjusted gross margin is no longer necessary, so we'll limit our commentary to our actual gross margins in the future. Just being able to make that statement affirms how much progress we've made.","As has been the trend for a number of quarters, our margin for the period included increased contribution from lot premiums and option revenues per closing. In fact, on a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter lot premiums and option margin per closing increased 57% to 13,000 and 15% to 44,000, respectively. On a sequential basis, lot premiums gained 14% while option dollars were up 5%.","Our margin also benefited from our continued focus on minimizing incentives. During the fourth quarter, our incentives were 1.7%, which is down 240 basis points from Q4 of last year and down slightly from the third quarter of 2013. Similar to our spec home numbers, we've likely reached the lower limit for incentives, and we expect they will bounce around this range for the foreseeable future unless market conditions change significantly.","Looking ahead, we expect higher land and construction costs to be an increasing headwind in 2014. However, we believe that our Value Creation work and common plan rollout, along with a reduction of approximately $50 million in capitalized interest expense from prior deleveraging activities, should benefit us in 2014. There will be quarter-to-quarter variations, but overall, we see opportunity for continued margin expansion in 2014.","We continue making progress on the implementation of common plans to help drive greater construction efficiency across the organization. During the fourth quarter, commonly managed plans accounted for 21% of our closings, which is up from 16% in the third quarter. We expect the use of common plans to grow towards 40% of deliveries in 2014 and remain on track toward being 70% or more of our production in the future.","Expanding the use of common plans, which have demonstrated higher acceptance rates with consumers and which typically carry higher margins, grows increasingly important given cost pressures to continue to build in the system. The entire lot cost is recycled through land positions or higher labor material pricing. Our ability to squeeze dollars out of the vertical construction would help support margins.","Turning to our overhead. Total SG&A spend for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $150 million or 9.3% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, overhead costs were $142 million or 9.6% of revenues. The increase in spending for the quarter reflects investments we've made in people and processes to support our common plan implementation, as well as higher incentive compensation resulting from the company's improved financial results.","Looking at Financial Services, our operations reported pretax income of $7 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Financial Services generated pretax loss of $24 million, which included a $49 million charge associated with potential future loan repurchase obligations. Financial Services income for the period was impacted by lower spread and lower origination volumes, each of which we attribute to an increasingly competitive mortgage-operating environment.","We did not adjust our mortgage repurchase reserves in the fourth quarter. Consistent with every quarterly close, we assess the ongoing volume, severity and potential future flow of claims related to historical originations. We also considered conditions in the broader operating environment, including policy changes at the GSEs and in turn, large financial institutions. While no reserve adjustment was taken in the quarter, we cannot rule out the possibility of an adjustment up or down based on facts or circumstances in the future.","Turning to taxes. We reported $12.4 million of tax expense in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate this quarter was impacted by the estimation process included when we reversed our deferred tax valuation allowances in the third quarter. Beginning in 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39%. Due to our significant loss carryforward position, cash-paid taxes are expected to be insignificant.","Looking at the bottom line. PulteGroup reported net income of $220 million or $0.57 per share, which is well above last year's results. Echoing some of Richard's earlier comments, our Value Creation work is clearly enabling PulteGroup to more effectively capitalize on the broader housing recovery than we might otherwise have in the past. Further, the company's performance versus the industry also points to the relative improvement we're generating as measured by gross margin, overhead leverage, inventory turns and return on invested capital. The gains we are realizing on the income statement continue to translate into ongoing improvements in our balance sheet and cash flows.","Looking at our investment in house and land, we had 4,874 homes under construction at the end of Q4, of which 24% were spec. Our strategy remains to minimize spec and focus on building to order given the enhanced margins we can typically realize. During the fourth quarter, we put 5,000 lots under control while investing a total of $361 million in land acquisition and development. Our land transactions continue to get slightly bigger with the size of our average transaction increasing to approximately 150 lots. Consistent with recent quarters, the significant majority of our recent transactions were raw and require development. As a result, they will not drive closings until 2015 and beyond.","We continue to see a heavy emphasis on projects that serve move-up buyers through our Pulte Homes brand. As the move-up buyer remains the most active segment of the market, these projects are providing the best returns on invested capital. That being said, our division continues to search for suitable projects to serve the first-time buyer, and I'm confident we can ramp up quickly if we see that consumer returning to the market.","We ended the quarter with 123,000 lots under control, of which 23% are under option, which is essentially unchanged from Q3. On a year-over-year basis, our lots under control and percentage under option have increased, which is consistent with our strategy. About 23% of our lots are finished, with another 19% currently under development.","Closing out the discussion on land. We invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development during the year. This was slightly below our authorized spend of $1.4 billion. We remain disciplined in our investment process and are confident that we can invest intelligently over time. We believe this discipline, combined with our improved home-building operations, will reduce the risk of overpaying for land.","As Richard mentioned, we've authorized $2 billion for land acquisition and development in 2014. It's important to note that this includes the carryover of unspent authorization from 2013. We want our land acquisition teams to invest but not to feel pressured to invest on a predetermined time line. As we've mentioned, we only want to invest on the risk-adjusted returns of a deal meet our criteria. We aren't chasing the market and remain confident in the ability of our teams to invest our capital effectively.","Looking at our cash flows for the quarter, we generated $326 million of cash flows from operations, spent $35 million to repurchase 2 million shares of our stock and paid $19 million in dividends. As of the end of the year, we reported $1.7 billion of cash, representing a sequential increase of $234 million from the third quarter.","On the topic of cash flows and capital allocation, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our 2013 accomplishments. Our operating cash flows for the year increased 16% to $881 million. We increased our investment in the business by $300 million or 30% to $1.3 billion. We reinstated our dividend at an annual rate that's 25% higher than our historical dividend. We continued our efforts to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, and we reinvigorated our share repurchase program. In total, we retired $461 million principal value of our debt and returned more than $156 million directly to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Even with all this activity, we were able to increase our cash position by $176 million over last year. Continuing the trend of the past 2 years, our leverage ratio improved during the quarter. We ended the year with a debt-to-cap ratio of 31%, which is down from 53% last year. We remain committed to our balanced approach to capital management, including the almost 50% increase in authorized 2014 land acquisition and development spend compared with 2013. We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our leverage and repurchase our stock.","During 2013, we repurchased a total of 7.2 million shares, representing approximately 2% of our outstanding common stock, for $118 million. At the end of the year, we had $234 million of capacity remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet and cash credit metrics are among the best in the industry and provide a strong financial foundation that will allow us to remain flexible as we evaluate debt and stock repurchases.","Just a few final stats on the quarter. Net new orders totaled 3,215 homes, which is a decrease of 18% from last year. The decrease in sign-ups was, in large part, attributable to our lower community count in combination with our focus on maximizing profitability per unit. Given strong price appreciation, the dollar value of sign-ups declined only 7% to $1.1 billion. In the quarter, sign-ups decreased 18% at Pulte, 30% at Centex and 7% at Del Webb, while absorption paces were down 12% at Pulte and roughly flat at Centex and Del Webb.","We ended the quarter with a community count of 577, which is down 14% from the end of last year and consistent with our guidance. As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expect to operate from an approximate range of 560 to 580 communities during all 4 quarters in 2014.","Our 2014 plan calls for us to open approximately 190 new communities, with roughly 40% of those communities coming online in the first half of the year. It will be a busy year for our operations, but it will also provide some exciting new floor plans and neighborhoods for our consumers. With so many new communities in the pipeline, the pace at which existing communities close out or delays in openings can impact quarterly reported community count. We ended the fourth quarter with a backlog valued at $1.9 billion, essentially unchanged from 2012.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. Let me provide a few high-level comments on market conditions during the quarter. Recognizing that the fourth quarter is historically the seasonal low point in demand, so trends can be hard to discern. That said, volumes were relatively stable across the quarter, and in fact, we sold virtually the same number of homes in December as November, which is a slightly better pattern than we normally experience. While I would say that the East Coast is in generally good shape, the Northeast down through Washington saw buyers pull back, we believe, largely due to lingering effects of the government shutdown. As you go further south into the Carolinas, Georgia and South Florida, consumers were certainly more active.","With the volume of rhetoric around budget deals and government shutdowns much lower now, we are optimistic about the spring selling season in the D.C. area and very confident about markets in the Southeast and Florida.","Moving into the middle of the country, pace has held up reasonably well in the Midwest, with considerable strength in Michigan and an ongoing rebound in Chicago and St. Louis. On a year-over-year basis, Texas was a little slower. As we talked about last quarter, Texas has a greater percentage of Centex buyers, so higher interest rates and the closeout of some communities impacted our numbers. And finally, out West, demand conditions really didn't change much from what we saw in the third quarter. We had pushed prices aggressively in the first half of 2013, so the spike in rates generally caused buyers to be more cautious.","On a relative basis, Arizona and the Pacific Northwest held up a little better than California and New Mexico. Looking beyond market conditions in Q4, an area that we are watching carefully as any impact that January's extreme weather in the Midwest and East Coast may have on housing production in the first half of 2014.","With regard to recent sales trends, let me add that we are very pleased with the traffic and sales activity we have seen thus far in the -- in January. Our sales results for 2014 will be impacted by lower year-over-year community count. But buyers are showing up in our communities, and seasonal momentum is beginning to build nicely. Based on the trends we have seen since December and extending into January, we are optimistic about the spring selling season ahead.","Before opening the call to questions, I will finish by saying that we are extremely gratified by the results we delivered in the fourth quarter and for all of 2013. It was a year of tremendous progress for our company and further confirmation of the gains our Value Creation strategy is helping to drive. In just a couple of years, we have gone from the middle or even bottom of the industry to among the top performers in the critical areas of margin, pretax profit growth, returns and strength of balance sheet.","We now enter the important spring selling season with very positive expectations, especially given our expanding library of innovative life-tested home designs, and a number of new communities to serve consumers. I'll complete my comments as they began by thanking our employees for their hard work on behalf of the company and our home buyers.","Thanks for your time this morning, and I'll now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Sarah, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is about the incremental land spend. And understanding the commentary about how the changes in your model and your operating strategy are enabling you to be able to buy more land and buy land more effectively or efficiently. I'm wondering if you can talk about how much of this is push and how much of this is pull? In other words, are you finding more opportunities in the market now maybe because of some of the slowdown in the back half of '13 that you're saying, \"Hey, we really want to go out there and pursue those opportunities?\" Or is this just the model has gotten efficient enough now that you can go out there and compete more aggressively with some of your peers for new land acquisitions?","Richard J. Dugas","David, it's Richard. I'd say it's some of both. Primarily as our model continues to get more efficient, we have a lot of confidence that we can drive excellent returns as we have with our land investment. And frankly, we've been increasing our appetite for land acquisition steadily over the past 18 to 24 months. So it's a little bit of both. Some additional opportunities, but primarily, I would say the confidence we have in our ability to find excellent transactions. And I'll just point out that we are absolutely not wavering from our disciplined criteria that we've had now for 3 years to generate the best returns on the land spend that we put out there.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. And then just as a follow-up, the price increases at Centex -- and Richard, in the commentary about how higher rates are impacting the business in Texas and the Centex business in Texas. Were you surprised by the higher prices at Centex? And is this more of a mix shift in terms of product? And I know you guys have kind of worked to get out there and be able to compete with the existing home market at Centex, and maybe that brought prices down. But it's just a little bit surprising on our end to hear Centex prices up. Can you talk about that a little bit, what's going on and what's driving that phenomenon?","Richard J. Dugas","No, listen, we've been reasonably pleased with what's happening in the entry level. And frankly, we're pleased with our sales results and our pricing across the board. With regard to Centex specifically, I think that brand, along with our others, are benefiting from the combination of pushing options, pushing lot premiums. All the components, obviously, that buyer doesn't have as much money as the move-up or Del Webb buyer to drive price. But overall, yes, we saw some impact from the rate change that we saw during the year. But I'll highlight, David, that things seemed to really begin to shift in December. I referenced in my remarks that December was equivalent to November, and we like what we're seeing so far in January. So we're optimistic about Centex and the rest of our portfolio heading into '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eli Hackel of Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just have a question on margins. Clearly, very impressive in the quarter. Just wondering if you could help us dissect that a little bit. How much was mix price, maybe move to the more commonly managed plans. And then you said -- looks like you may be able to improve margin -- gross margins further in 2014. Is that on a full year-over-year basis or starting from the end of the year?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","All right. So margins in 2014, we believe year-over-year, we have room to improve obviously from the margin that we had for full year of '13. As we look at our backlog, we've got visibility into -- essentially the first 2 quarters and think we've got room there. We benefit from not only improved efficiency and construction but also from a reduction in our capitalized interest because of the deleveraging we've done. In terms of breaking down the margin specifically between mix, it is a challenge for us to do that because there's a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, the change in our business towards our higher-margin -- sorry, Pulte and Del Webb is the benefit. The good news is that consistent with recent quarters, the margin improvement we've seen has been across all 3 brands. So it really is underlying improvement in the operations, not just mix shift, that's increasing our margin.","Richard J. Dugas","Eli, Richard here. One additional add-on, as Bob indicated, it's a lot of things. And one thing I'd reference, in his prepared remarks, Bob indicated that lot premiums and option margins were up, both sequentially and year-over-year. So we continue to be able to eke out gains in several different areas, the Common Plan Management, the pricing strategies, all of it is benefiting an exceptional margin performance in Q4.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Just wondered if you could maybe help me understand a little bit more about what optimistic means for spring selling. Does that mean absorptions could get to the point where they're flat year-over-year? Or maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful.","Richard J. Dugas","Listen, I can't give you predictions in terms of details. I'll tell you this. It feels like in December, buyers started to get more comfortable with the increased rate environment. And we were very pleased that December was flat with November, which historically doesn't happen in this business. And January has gotten off to a good start. I'll leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Congratulations on a great quarter and a phenomenal year. The question is can you surpass it? You got a high bar now. But it sounds like you have confidence that you can. One question related to the gross margins. When you're underwriting the new land that you're acquiring, are you assuming the gross margins are going to be at the same run rate? And is there expectations for any pricing in your underwriting? Or are you assuming prices currently at the level it is today? First question.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. So as to underwriting standards, we do not assume price appreciation in our underwriting. So we do use current pricing but don't project forward. And I forgot the first question.","Richard J. Dugas","Gross margin or something. [indiscernible] more kind of question.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. Sorry...","Richard J. Dugas","I can help with that. Ivy, this is Richard. With regard to margins, something that you might be interested in is margins on transactions that we have underwritten over the past couple of years continue to exceed margins on our legacy land bank. And we continue to be pleased with that. We believe this is a result of a lot of the efficiency that we're driving in the business through Common Plan Management and our pricing strategies that is causing that. In terms of where margin sort of go from here, as Bob indicated, we believe we have room to go in 2014. We'll have to see how it all plays out. But given the visibility we have for the first couple of quarters, we're optimistic.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So it sounds like it's not contingent on price, which is, when I finish the next question, you can confirm. But that's good news. The active adult market, we have heard, has gotten better, really starting in December and seen some traction there. Given you guys are the largest builder that services that market, can you go into a little bit more detail what you're seeing there? And certainly, that consumer is much more affected about what happens in Washington and the confidence in the country and the economy. I'd love to hear your thoughts around that, please.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ivy, on the active adult side, we have noted some strength in active adult particularly in January in the markets that we have quite a bit of active adult activity. It's been an area of strength, maybe notable strength for the company thus far. I believe that, that buyer group continues to slowly but surely improve, which is typically what we'd see in a housing recovery. They tend to be a lagger. But starting last year and certainly into the first few weeks of this year, we've definitely seen some strength in Del Webb.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the sort of different products there in terms of Pulte, Centex and Del Webb. You talked about Centex being 22% from 27%. Wondering if you can sort of talk about absorption across the brands and how that was over the course of the fourth quarter, and sort of what are you expecting here?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Sure. So what we saw during the quarter in terms of absorptions was off 12% for Pulte and, like we said, roughly flat for Centex and Del Webb. So I'm not sure if there's more you wanted.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in -- you talked about the -- sort of the best returns in terms of the -- best returns on capital in terms of the move-up, and so some of the investment is going there. Presumably, with some of those projects taking -- being more time-intensive in terms of the holding period for that land, then it would also -- in terms of getting that return, you would need a higher margin. So a mix shift towards Pulte and Del Webb would presumably also be positive from a margin standpoint, correct?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, I think it depends. Interestingly for -- even the entry-level land that we see today, a lot of it is raw. So the hold period isn't distinctly different. The Del Webb is a little bit different because typically, they are longer-lived communities, whether it's 1,000 or 2,000 lots, so it takes longer. So typically, we'll have more development profit in that, and so yes, you would expect to see higher gross margins. And historically, that has certainly been the case. The Del Webb brand does represent our highest margin in the mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen East, ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Richard, if you look at your big land spend for next year, you're not really moving your community count. So even though you're opening a lot, you've got a lot that are closing out, too. When you look at that, is there a mix impact? Because I assume most of these would have the common floor plan approach to it. Should all else being equal, do we have a mix shift up on your gross margins just from that? And if you looked at the CFP, just holding everything else static, I know there's a lot of moving parts, but holding everything else static, what type of margin differential do you have in that versus your older product?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. So, Stephen, a couple -- to clarify a couple of things. The $2 billion in authorized land spend is going to impact 2015 and 2016, not '14, in terms of deliveries. We expect that our common plans will represent about 40% of closings this year, building toward our long-term goal of 70-plus percent, as Bob indicated. Having said all that, we are going to have a continued mix shift during the year toward Pulte away from Centex. And Bob had indicated that's as a result of the underwriting and investment that we made over the past 12 to 18 months. So yes, there'll be a continued mix shift this year into Pulte, but the incremental land spend will benefit volumes and community count and all that in later periods beyond '14.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","And one point of clarity on that. In terms of the land spend, if you remember last year, we've told you that roughly 2\/3 of our spend was development and a 1\/3 third was land acquisition. What we saw in the fourth quarter, on the $360-ish million, there's roughly 40% land, 60% development. Out into '14, we think that, that actually moves even closer, so it's about 45% on land and 55% on development. So you've got a little bit -- you need to understand what's happening in the cash spend. It's not all on dirt. It is also the development dollars that we'll spend on the things that we have acquired over the last 12 to 18 months.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then if we look at -- you had been metering sales and some, and I realize the demand has slowed down a lot. But do you have any areas where you have to meter sales as you make these transitions? And then just differently, on your SG&A, your expectations for operational leverage in 2014.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. So, Stephen, I'll handle the first one, and Bob can answer your SG&A question. We have been metering sales in several communities in several areas of the country, very consistent with the strategy that we've had for a while. And yes, I would expect that to continue this year, depending on our lot supply in a given community when the replacement parcel is coming online. And it's all about returns. Our operators are very well disciplined on looking at pace versus price. And if we have a large land bank, like we may have in a Del Webb community with lots and lots in front of us, we'll let it run and drive pace. But in some of the Pulte communities where we may only have 50 lots left or 25 lots left, we're going to be driving price as hard as we can. So that's on the sales metering. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. And on leverage, we had approximately $570 million in SG&A this year, what is that 10.3% of revenue. We've talked in the past about a lot of that spend being relatively fixed -- our commissions are in SG&A. So going forward, we highlighted for you in the fourth quarter that some of our spend was related to people and processes we're putting in for the Common Plan Management. We'll see that in '14 as well. So I think you would expect us to probably put a little bit of cost in to try and continue that effort. Then leverage would be depending on what you think volume is going to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Congrats on the quarter and the gross margins. And maybe just hitting on that topic for the first question. You've seen, obviously, a great acceleration in the pre-interest gross margin and, as you said, I believe beating the record back in '05. So as you think about that, I mean, certainly, I guess on a full year basis for '14, you're looking at to be above '13. If I understand that correct, Bob, you were saying that you expect that to be both pre- and post-interest. Correct me if I'm wrong. But how would you view...","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","No, Mike, just to clarify, that was post-interest that we were saying that.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So in that -- that really speaks for the question. Given the results in the back half of the year, particularly in 4Q '13. I mean, how do you view the sustainability of that? And if there might have been some amount of, let's say, excess price appreciation, among other things, that maybe it's not the right number to model sustainably going forward.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, I think, obviously, as we look at fiscal '14, we see an absolute ability to see margin improvement because of the scaling up that we saw during the year. Our margins grew quarter-by-quarter in '13, and our backlog is relatively consistent with the business environment that we saw during the back half of '13. Obviously, there was a little bit of relative weakness in the fourth quarter given all the noise around interest rates, et cetera. But again, looking at it, we think that we can continue to drive margins on a core basis, consistent with what we saw in the back half of this year, especially as we roll out the commonly managed plan. And then obviously, we get the benefit of lower interest amortization. For perspective, roughly $50 million, if you look at fiscal '13 volumes, that's about a point of margin.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I guess maybe excluding the benefit from the interest expense and if you just look at the pre-interest gross margin, you did about 25%, I think, a little over 25% for full year '13. Given the positive momentum that you saw in the back half of this year, would you expect '14 to be above back half of '13?","Richard J. Dugas","Mike, I think Bob indicated that we thought that it could be consistent with in that range based on the backlog that we see. He also mentioned quarter-to-quarter variation. Margins are not certainly going to move in a straight line all the time, but we like our overall position. And frankly, the deleveraging that we've done, all the work we've done on common plans, all the work we've done on pricing, we expect to continue to benefit us collectively. And that's the way we're looking at it, is what's the actual margin we deliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Obviously, your margins are progressing, so I'd like to focus on orders, which are more difficult to control and predict. Our view is seasonal, not cyclical growth right now. And, Richard, your comments around 1Q trend -- historically, 1Q absorptions increased about 38% from 4Q. That's back to 1999, and 4Q this quarter decelerated 11% from the third quarter, which is actually right what history would suggest. So could you comment on your optimism around spring being above the historical absorption change, which another builder has commented on that? Or are you just realizing the normal seasonal absorption improvements? Just trying to see if seasonality is a good benchmark for your comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Ken, I'll just point out that we're 4 weeks into the year. What I will tell you, though, is that there was a noticeable shift in the market in December. Normally, you wouldn't see seasonal momentum begin building until late January, and we saw it building a little bit earlier this year. And I believe it's because buyers became a little bit more comfortable with the rate environment that kind of shocked them in the third and early parts of the fourth quarter and realized that the housing market is still very attractive. So it's hard to predict exactly what the spring selling season is going to bring. But at this point, we believe it's going to be a good one.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then looking at Del Webb, given that you are servicing a select age group. We had done a piece showing that, the older people are working, contributing to the labor force more than they had in the past. Can you comment on the buyers? I mean, do they tend to -- are you seeing more working buyers in your Del Webb communities?","Richard J. Dugas","Ken, you're exactly right. The buyer profile is changing. We're seeing more and more working buyers in Del Webb, and we're pleased with the activity that we're seeing in Del Webb. And part of our strategy as a result of the trends we're seeing is to decrease the size of our future investment in Del Webb communities. We'd love the demographic, and we actually are in the middle of a significant study right now on how to really capitalize even further on that changing demographic. We'll have more to say about that as our plans evolve over time. But yes, the Del Webb buyer is changing, and we're keeping up with them. And we like what we see because we believe a combination of smaller Del Webb communities going forward that, frankly, don't provide as much land risk over time is a good thing. And they can be very return-friendly communities from what we've seen. So we like the position we have, and we're optimistic about that category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The 190 communities that are going to be new openings, of the 570 that you're going to have total for 2014. Just wanted to get a sense of what that ratio looked like for 2013. And also, I think -- I'm not sure you -- I don't think you talked about this. But of the 190, how many of those are newly acquired and how many would be from your lot inventories?","Richard J. Dugas","Go ahead, Bob.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","I was going to say not a dramatically different number of openings. We had probably more closings in fiscal '13. And we do not have a significant number of previously unopened communities opening. So no -- not a big mothballed community count.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, the vast majority of that, Nishu, would be new dirt.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Correct.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, acquired since the recovery. Okay, great. And second question. Now obviously, the benefits -- the dividends of your Value Creation strategy and the margins are pretty apparent, very, very strong trend there, as many have noted. A part of your Value Creation strategy has been to shift away from focusing on volumes. So the sorts of analysis that investors and other builders do where they're saying, we did x number of closings in 2005. We're in some new markets so we can do that many again. I know that you have very much shifted away from that. But I wanted to ask you to just think about, in the housing recovery, given your Value Creation strategy, can you grow as fast as the market? So if housing starts -- single-family housing starts after double from here, can, under the Value Creation strategy, Pulte keep up with that growth? Can Pulte double as well in that kind of setup?","Richard J. Dugas","Nishu, there's absolutely no restriction on our ability to grow. It's going to be a function of the investment that we put into the business. What I will tell you is that the $1.3 billion we invested this year was a 30% improvement over prior year, and the $2 billion that we are targeting to invest this year is almost a 50% improvement on that $1.3 billion. Any way you slice it, that's a lot of growth that we're anticipating going forward. Having said that, our focus is on return. And every single community, we're going to do the best we can to maximize return, whether that's driving pace or price. And frankly, all the return on invested capital metrics that I look at, we are now right around second place in the industry, behind NVR who obviously has a lot lower overall capital base in terms of land than anybody else. So we're extremely pleased, and we believe investors over the long run are going to benefit from that strategy over the cycle. So we are interested in growing. We want to grow based on the market opportunity that we see. We just don't want to be exclusively focused on growth like we were in the past and make the mistakes that we made in the past. And we're not going to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In light of the kind of metering and the discipline you talked about and the community count trajectory, when you look at the full year 2014, is your expectation for positive order growth?","Richard J. Dugas","Adam, we're not going to get into commentary on that. I will say that volume will ultimately follow the investment to some degree, and then the rest of it, of course, is up to the macro environment and then our individual strategy by community. So we'll let you model what your model will produce, but we're not going to comment on specifics there.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question goes to capital allocation. You mentioned in your prepared remarks you had tremendous financial flexibility. You have big cash balance, and the buyback has been, I would say, somewhat minor relative to the cash balance. Can you provide any kind of range in the order of magnitude of stock you think you might like to repurchase? And then can you also discuss if acquiring any small private builders is on your radar screen or not?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Adam, we haven't given any color or commentary around our buying patterns and will not be on our stock. As it relates to smaller builders, we've certainly see everything that's out in the market. We've got contacts, and people recognize we have the balance sheet to do it. We haven't seen any to this point that were attractive to us for a variety of reasons. But certainly, nothing stopping us from doing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify what I thought you said. First, so I guess with your gross margins, you had mentioned, I thought, Bob, about a $50 million reduction in capitalized interest would equal 100 basis points. So I want to make sure, did you imply that -- from that comment that your capitalized interest that you're going to expense in 2014 would be $50 million less than it was in 2013? And if that isn't what you meant, if you could be a little bit more precise about what you think it will be and how it will flow over the year, that would be really helpful.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, Steven, that is exactly what I said. Our capitalized interest expense will be in the neighborhood of $50 million lower in 2014 than it was in 2013. The point I was making about the 100 basis points is if you applied that $50 million reduction to our '13 business, it was about 100 basis points. Obviously, what it would mean in '14 would be dependent on what you think our volume will be.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then if I could ask you a question about your inventory. Could you give us a sense for what your inventory breakout figures were? I'm looking for the homes under construction, and then also, if you have like a sticks-and-bricks type figure, that would be great.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Okay. Total homes under construction were 4,874 at the end of the quarter. 1,151 of those were spec, so 24%. And total sticks and bricks were $525 million at the end of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask your average order price. In the last quarter, it was $336,000, up 13% year-over-year, and good sequential growth as well. Would you be happy if for the full year 2014, it was up mid-single digits? And what do you view as the outlook for continued price increases this year?","Richard J. Dugas","Listen, we'd be happy with pricing growth, of course. Some of that's going to be mix shift-driven, and we haven't sort of commented on specifically exactly what we expect there. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question, Bob?","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was just looking for a general range. Like would mid-single-digit ASP growth for new orders be something that you would say, \"Hey, that's realistic and achievable, and we'll be happy with that\"? I'm not looking for a specific number.","Richard J. Dugas","I'll answer it this way. The total price lift that we had in the market in 2013, I think, was unique and special. Yes, I would say the range that you mentioned would be a realistic macro forecast. But listen, who knows exactly what's going to unfold here. We'll have to see.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And you're doing a lot to control costs and SG&A, too. And I was just thinking, how should we think about the trajectory of SG&A dollar spending levels as volume increases? Obviously, you got a lot of new communities opening up. You had a great year in terms of cost control. I just wanted to get your view on how achievable it is to stay at the current level. Is it sustainable? Or should we look for dollar spend to rise pretty substantially with new community openings?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. As we talked about, obviously, our spend is relatively fixed because we don't have the commission and SG&A. We did highlight that we will likely continue to spend a little bit of money to do the Common Plan Management. And consistent with what we've said in the past, the growth of SG&A spend will be dependent on how we grow the business. And so if we do it through a huge increase in community count, you have costs associated with opening new communities versus if you get pace increases inside the business. So if the Del Webb brand were to expand dramatically, we don't need to spend much of any overhead to make that happen because it's really just hiring 1 or 2 more people to manage the process. So again, we're pretty comfortable with the spend. We're investing a little bit in the improvement processes. If we were to rapidly expand our footprint, you might see us spend some more money.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Roxland of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When I -- just following up on SG&A. When I look at SG&A, it came with -- on a percentage basis, it came with -- came in somewhat higher than we were expecting. Were there any surprises in the quarter from your vantage point?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","No.","Richard J. Dugas","No, there weren't. No, we were happy with our spend levels, and our closing volumes came in where we expected.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just because when I look at SG&A -- if we look back historically, typically, on a percentage of sales basis, you typically see a decline. And I think it was a little bit higher, if I'm not mistaken, versus 3Q. Is that just more like the comp spending that you're over the -- the SG&A higher this quarter relative to historical patterns?","Richard J. Dugas","Mike, there was some of that clearly in the gross number. But I think more of it, frankly, is we don't have a spec model anymore, and our ability to convert a lot of spec units to drop to the bottom line is a lot less than it was in the past, and the consistency with which we're running the business year-over-year is a whole lot different. So I'd suspect it might have been as much the revenue conversion as the absolute SG&A levels. But in terms of actual spend, your compensation expense was up a little bit based on a good year. And Bob had indicated we did some investment for our Common Plan Management work, some IT investment, things like that. But my guess is most of it was the change in conversion based on the fact that we're a presale builder today.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just quickly following up on your comments regarding how constructive you are in sales in January, would it be fair to say that January has been better than December? Certainly, your tone has indicated that. And have you seen improvement in January accelerate on a weekly basis? And is there any one area that you would cite as showing more notable improvement than others?","Richard J. Dugas","Listen, with regard to January trends, we're not going to comment on the detail there. The seasonal build is sort of what we referenced, and we'll kind of leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First question on the mortgage put-back issue. Was that just a function of declining put-back requests? Or is it more related to the guidance that the FHFA gave out late in 2012 -- or 2013, sorry?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, certainly we take everything into consideration. If you look at what we prepared in the webcast slides, the volume came down during the fourth quarter, but it was still at a relatively high level consistent with earlier in the year. We look at payments that we have made. You can see or you will be able to see in our filings that our reserve balance went down by virtue of making some payments. Those payments were consistent with what we had accrued. We certainly pay attention to what the FHFA is saying about when they think they'll be done with their review of files. So on balance, when we look at it, and we do every quarter, we didn't see anything that would tell us that the accrual we have is incorrect.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just want to shift gears to Del Webb. Just want to find out if you're having to dial up incentives to drive that buyer in or if they're coming in willing to pay full boat. Just a little more commentary about what you're seeing in the field from those active adult buyers.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, we're not dialing up incentives for active adult. That buyer is, frankly, not very price-sensitive. We like that category, and as I indicated, we like the trends we see building so far this year there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Randow of Citi.","William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of bookkeeping items. In regards to the on balance sheet DTA, can you remind me of the pace of the cash realization and any limitations on such?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","No limitations that we're aware of, so that -- which is the reason we reversed essentially all of the reserve. The cash utilization of that will be predicated on earnings.","William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And in regards to -- I can't remember if you mentioned it, but what's the number of developed lots ready the go? And if you could provide a qualitative split between Pulte, Del Webb and Centex.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","The developed lots ready to go that we own are 23,245. And then we also have developed lots optioned, 5,124.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Locker of FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you about your SG&A. You guys touched on -- with the $570 million run rate in '13. Do you expect to be flattish from there? Or do you expect that, with the back end being up 5%, 6%, kind of the same year-over-year increase in '14 as you -- over '13?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, as we've talked about, not a significant change in spend other than the fact we will continue to invest. We obviously have cost pressures on wages. We have normal merit increases. So you're probably there plus some.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","And I guess just your tax valuation allowance, what's remaining off balance sheet?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","$157 million.","Operator","And your next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Quick housekeeping item. Can you quantify what the commissions' numbers was as a percentage of revenue that was in the cost of goods sold?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, I don't have an exact number on that, but it typically runs at about the 4.5% range.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Typically 4.5% total? Okay, correct. One other strategic question, would you guys consider looking at private builder acquisitions to accelerate your community count growth? How do you guys evaluate buying another builder out there as opposed to just open-market land acquisitions?","Richard J. Dugas","Buck, we definitely would consider that and continue to look at the opportunities that get presented to us. As Bob indicated, with the firepower that we have, we get to look at everything. And we would underwrite it very similarly to a raw land transaction. We'd look at the IRR characteristics, the risk involved and the number of lots undertaken, et cetera. And we'll continue to look at those very opportunistically just like we would raw land.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alex Barr\u00f3n of Housing Research.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I was wondering if you guys have done any kind of analysis on the qualified mortgage and what impact that would have had on -- and how many buyers maybe wouldn't have made it last year?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, I think we've commented on this in -- when it got asked in the past, and it's a very small percentage, certainly under 5%, maybe 3% or 2%. So I would tell you that to this point, that has proven to be true.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Got it. And as far as the DTA, I think you guys had a small balance left over last quarter of, like, $231 million. Do you have that -- an update on that? Or did you guys reverse any more this quarter of that?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, I think that question just got asked but a little differently. So essentially, we did have a reserve last quarter. The way the accounting works is we were -- the GAAP tells you that when we book the adjustment in the third quarter, we projected what we would utilize in the fourth quarter. So we used about $73 million during the fourth quarter for fourth quarter earnings, and we have about $157 million left on the books at the end of the year.","Operator","And I have no further questions queued up at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenter for closing remarks.","James P. Zeumer","Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome you all to the PulteGroup Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jim Zeumer. You may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our second quarter financial results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2013. On the call to discuss Pulte's results are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that copies of this morning's earnings release and the related release on our dividend and expanded share repurchase program, along with the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. Further, an audio replay of today's call will also be available on the site later today. I also want to alert participants that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including references to gross margins reflecting certain adjustments, are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the press release and as an appendix to the call's presentation slide deck. Finally, today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested on our -- by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call as we discuss the strong second quarter operating and financial performance that PulteGroup reported earlier this morning. As you are aware, we also issued a press release yesterday afternoon announcing the declaration of a quarterly dividend and the expansion of our share repurchase plan. Bob will provide more information on these announcements later in the call.","Taken in combination, our solid second quarter financial results; the allocation of capital to fund the dividend, our first in more than 4 years; and the expansion of our share repurchase plan reflect continued progress in our efforts to drive higher shareholder returns through greater operational and capital efficiency. We are very pleased with the strides our organization continues to make. While it is minimally 90 days since our last earnings call, questions and comments about the industry suggest that many believe the operating environment has been significantly impacted by the recent uptick in mortgage rates. Obviously, rates are important, but our internal data suggest that not much has changed so far in the macro housing market.","We have been consistent in saying that the recovery in housing has been more about lack of supply than a dramatic increase in fundamental buyer demand. The significant drawdown of foreclosed and other distress inventory, combined with the extremely tight supply of existing and new homes, has done 2 things. First, it provided an environment where selling prices could stabilize and then ultimately begin to recover. Second, these supply and pricing dynamics helped to create a sustained sense of urgency among prospective buyers who are now more anxious to purchase a home. We have also said that measured rate increases, in concert with healthy macroeconomic performance, would be another factor that could increase that sense of urgency among buyers. Recent analyst reports also suggest that demand conditions have not changed materially and that house inventory remains extremely tight in most markets.","At the risk of stating the obvious, I would remind everyone that while home prices and rates are higher, they started from such a low base that consumers can still find value in buying a new home today. This is especially true given that apartment rental rates continue to march higher in many markets. Just as market conditions remain on track, so do our business strategies and the tactics as we continue to implement the plan we articulated over 24 months ago. While there are many components to our work, the goals remain to deliver higher returns on investment capital over the housing cycle by focusing on expanding gross margins, driving greater overhead leverage, improving inventory turns and buy more efficiently and effectively using capital. Successful execution of these key initiatives is enabling PulteGroup to drive meaningful and, we believe, sustainable earnings growth, which is critical to the company delivering higher returns on invested capital. We believe that over time our focus on running a better homebuilding operation will allow us to grow the quantity, as well as the quality of our earnings that we generate, while supporting better long-term returns.","The improvements in our second quarter earnings results show that these continue to be the right areas of focus as we reported earnings of $0.09 per share, including $0.17 per share of charges, which Bob will discuss. Adjusting for the charges, earnings would be more than double last year's second quarter earnings of $0.11 a share. Among the key drivers of our improved earnings performance is our focus on driving price and margin, rather than simply pushing unit volume, an approach we would have likely employed in the past. Consistent with this focus, our average selling price was up $25,000 to $294,000. Benefiting from the increased selling prices, along with our efforts to lower house construction costs, our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter expanded by 360 basis points over the prior year to 23.9%. This marks the 10th quarter in a row of improvement in our adjusted gross margin. We don't provide formal guidance, but given the strong pricing environment, coupled with trends in material costs and our initiatives to drive construction efficiency, we see opportunities for margins to continue expanding in the future.","Certainly, an ongoing shift in product mix to move-up homes is helping reported prices in margins, where we have realized higher selling prices across each of our brands. Further, in the past 90 days, I will tell you that our markets have raised prices in at least 50% of open communities, while many of our divisions are reporting that they actually raised prices in all of their communities during the quarter. The price increases during the quarter, which will benefit future closings, were generally in the range of 1% to 5%. Consistent with this focus on price over pace, we have continued to be very measured in our selling efforts. As we have talked about on prior calls, we continue to purposely meter sales across a number of communities in key markets throughout the country. Based on feedback from our operations, in about 2\/3 of our markets, we have purposely constrained sales to some degree in 10% or more of the available communities. In fact, in some of the hotter markets out west, including Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, we have controlled sales in more than 50% of the open communities.","In a nutshell, we are effectively maximizing the value of our land assets by selling houses for more money and better margins, while using the resulting strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay down debt and as demonstrated by our action on dividends and share repurchases, returning funds to shareholders. Some of you have heard us say that along with being a more efficient operator, we want to be more balanced with regard to the capital allocation decisions we make in our business. I think the decisions implemented in the second quarter demonstrate that we are committed to this model.","Before handling -- handing the call over to Bob, I want to provide a few comments related to the impact of higher interest rates on housing demand. As I said earlier, we view the initial recovery in U.S. housing as being more about changes in supply than demand. Further, we have said that in light of today's tight mortgage lending environment, it is generally the more qualified move-up buyer who is the most active in the market today. Given this combination, over the near term, we continue to believe that the recent rise in rates is likely to have only a limited impact on demand, especially if the higher rates reflect the strengthening economy.","Specific to PulteGroup, we can tell you that traffic to our communities remain consistent over the quarter, while cancellation rates were a little changed in the period. We did a quick check on our operations, and about 85% of our divisions believe that the rise in rates has had little impact so far, or may have actually worked to increase buyer activity. As I mentioned, with rates rising from such low levels and uptick can spur more buyers that it eliminates over the short term, although we have to see how this plays out going forward. We are in the camp that if higher rates reflect improving economic conditions, we would expect the housing recovery to remain on track. As an industry, we can sell more houses if more people have jobs even with modestly higher rates.","Let me now turn the call over to Bob for more details on our quarterly results. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard, and good morning. Building on Richard's comments, I would agree to the gains realized in our Q2 financial results and the capital positions we announced yesterday reflect the successful execution of our value creation program launched in 2011. It's rewarding to see that the hard work by our employees is beginning to payoff.","Now let me review some of the numbers. For the second quarter, home sale revenues increased 19% over the prior year to $1.2 billion. The increase in revenue reflects a 9% increase in closing to 4,152 homes, in combination with the $25,000 or 9% increase in average selling price to $294,000.","The higher selling price was driven by price increases, as well as the ongoing shift in our closings towards move-up and active adult homes. Specifically, we realized higher selling prices within each of our brands, including increases of 8% in Pulte, 1% in Centex and 10% in Del Webb. And our closing mix included 46% from Pulte, 27% from Del Webb and 27% from Centex, which is consistent with the first quarter of this year.","You may recall in the second quarter of last year, our closing mix was 42% from Pulte, 25% from Del Webb and 33% from Centex. Consistent with recent quarters, the contribution of closings from Centex communities has seen a significant decrease. Land sale revenues in the quarter were $20 million. We will continue to opportunistically divest noncore land assets, although timing of any resulting transactions can vary greatly from period-to-period.","In the second quarter, we reported an adjusted gross margin of 23.9%, which is 360 basis points higher than Q2 of last year and 100 basis points higher than Q1 of this year. Consistent with prior quarters, our adjusted gross margin continued to benefit from company-specific and industry-wide factors, including better pricing, an increase in the volume of home closings from our Pulte and Del Webb branded communities and our ongoing efforts to lower home construction costs.","Gross margins are also benefiting from our strategic pricing initiatives, pursuant to which we are fine tuning pricing and more accurately identifying those items that consumers truly value. Consistent with recent quarters, margin contributions from lot premiums and option revenues increased, and sales discounts dropped 290 basis points to 2.6%.","During our last earnings call, we introduced the metric of closings from commonly managed floor plan. As we've discussed, these are homes that have been constructed under the more efficient design, cost and build processes that we are implementing throughout the country. You may recall that in Q1, the percentage of closings from such commonly managed plans was 12%. On a unit basis, the number of closings from commonly managed plans increased from Q1 of this year by roughly 25% to almost 600 homes. As a percent of total Q2 closings, commonly managed plans now account for 13%. We expect this percentage will grow in future quarters as we roll out our processes across the country.","Our total overhead spend for the second quarter this year was $151 million or 12.3% of home sale revenues. This includes $13 million or 110 basis points of costs associated with our relocation to Atlanta. This compares to SG&A of $124 million or 12.1% of revenues in Q2 of last year. The current year relocation charges include estimates for severance, retention award and relocation costs. Other than the office relocation charges, the year-over-year increase in SG&A was due primarily to higher variable comp, resulting from the company's improved financial results, as well as volume-sensitive costs. We're pleased to see that after adjusting for the office relocation charges, the company continued to realize leverage on its overhead spend as costs increased by only $13 million against the top line revenue increase of $195 million.","Our financial services operations generated pretax income of $16 million in the quarter, which was consistent with the prior year. Total mortgage origination volumes for the quarter increased 8% to 2,812 due to the increase in closing volumes from our homebuilding operations, partially offset by a 200 basis point decrease in our capture rate to 80%.","Moving down the income statement. The company reported other expenses net of $57 million for the quarter. This was driven primarily by 2 items. In the quarter, we retired $434 million of senior notes. This includes $399 million in connection with the previously announced redemption of all of our 2014 notes, as well as $35 million acquired note for the market transaction. We recorded an aggregate $23 million loss in connection with these transactions, including the write-off of unamortized discounts, premiums and transaction fees.","We also recorded a $30 million charge resulting from a contractual dispute at a previously completed luxury community in a market the company had since exited. This dispute has progressed through various stages of arbitration, but is not yet fully resolved. The charge reflects our best estimate of cost resulting from arbitration ruling and ongoing settlement discussions, but the ultimate resolution of these may -- these claims may be different and could result in additional costs of as much as $40 million. We currently anticipate the majority of these claims will be received -- resolved in 2013.","In summary, PulteGroup reported second quarter net income of $36 million or $0.09 per share, which included $67 million or $0.17 per share in charges. For the second quarter of 2012, the company recorded net income of $42 million or $0.11 per share. Overall, our homebuilding operations continued to demonstrate meaningful improvement across all the key metrics we have been focusing on, including price, margins and overhead leverage.","Let me now highlight some of the significant strides we've made in our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash despite paying down the $434 million of debt during the period, as we continued to generate cash flow from operations during a period when we would typically experience a cash outflow to fund our business. The strong cash flow reflects our higher closing volumes, improved profitability and to a smaller degree, further reductions in our spec inventory.","At quarter end, we had only 271 finished specs on the ground, which represents a decrease of 55% compared to the second quarter of last year. In total, we ended the quarter with fewer than 900 specs in production or less than 1.5 specs per community. This is down 45% from last year. And at the end of the second quarter, we had 6,539 homes under construction, which means that spec building has dropped to 13% of production. This is roughly half of what it was a year ago and only 25% of what it was at the end of 2011.","As we've discussed on prior calls, we typically see better pricing and higher margins on dirt sales than we do on spec units. I would also point out that in addition to supporting better margins and freeing up working capital, reducing our spec production has the added benefit of aiding our house inventory turn, which continued to improve in the period.","Looking at land activity. We've put approximately 10,100 lots under control during the quarter and invested a total of $332 million in land acquisition and development. This is up from $206 million in the first quarter of this year and is consistent with our previously announced plans to raise our land investment authorization by roughly 40% this year.","As we've discussed, our improving operational capability has given us significant great -- significantly greater financial flexibility. In recent years, we've used this as an opportunity to reduce our leverage, including the debt that we retired this quarter. As a result, our debt-to-cap ratio has declined to 47% from 61% at this time last year. Net of cash on hand, our debt-to-cap has dropped to 26%.","I'm pleased to say that our improving flexibility allows us to extend our capital allocation options to include the dividend, as well as potential share repurchases. As we have discussed, we would like to be more balanced with our capital and believe the return of capital to shareholders should be part of our capital decision model.","To that end, I'm pleased to report that our board has declared a quarterly cash dividend, our first since the end of 2008. The $0.05 per share dividend will be payable August 12 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 5. The board also approved the share repurchase authorization for an additional $250 million, raising the company's total repurchase authorization to $352 million. As noted in the release announcing these actions, we believe they illustrate our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company and are consistent with our focus on increasing shareholder value and returning capital to our shareholders. Considering the dividend and repurchase authorizations, our current capital decisions reflect the broader and more balanced approach we have been talking about over the last year.","Before handing the call back to Richard, let me cover a few more data points. In the second quarter, net new orders totaled 4,885 homes, which is a decrease of 12% from last year. Given the price increases we've realized, the dollar value of sign-ups is $1.5 billion, which is down only 5% from the prior year. Sign-ups for the period were impacted by a 16% decrease in community count, as well as by the company's decision to purposely close sales in a number of communities, particularly in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California where we've sold too fast at the start of the recovery in 2012. We sold 400 fewer units in these 3 markets in the second quarter this year, which was a major contributor to the year over decline -- year-over-year decline in total sign-ups. Breaking down the sign-up numbers a little further, on a year-over-year basis, sign-ups decreased 20% at Pulte and 18% at Centex, while increasing 8% at Del Webb.","Absorption paces per community were up 14% at Centex and 15% at Del Webb and slowed 8% at Pulte, which was impacted by our efforts to maximize the profit opportunity of each house. And finally, we ended the quarter with 8,558 homes in backlog valued at $2.7 billion. Backlog units and dollars are up 13% and 25%, respectively, over the prior year.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. Before we open the call for questions, I will spend just a couple of minutes offering comments on market conditions we experienced during the second quarter. As you would anticipate, based on our comments on this call, we view overall market conditions to be very favorable. By geography, I would offer the following views. Buyer demand on the East Coast was generally strong from the Northeast down to Florida with notable strength in the Greater Boston area, as well as Raleigh and Atlanta. The strength in Atlanta is a positive development and that it was one of the last markets to participate in the recovery. Given the volume and profit potential this city can generate, we're excited to see this turnaround turn into a meaningful and sustained upcycle. Further south, demand in Florida remained strong in the quarter, as inventory levels are contained and pricing continues to move higher.","Demand conditions in our Midwest markets continued to be robust. We are even seeing an upturn in demand in Chicago, which like Atlanta was one of the last markets to participate in the housing recovery. Chicago was another city that can generate substantial pretax income, so we're encouraged to see a revival in this key Midwest market. Continuing the trend from the start of the year, demand on the ground in Texas is strong, although we are opting to focus on price and margin, rather than just driving units. And finally, as you read in just about every report, consumer demand out west remains one of the strongest in the entire country. From Seattle to California and the Southwest, demand far outpaces supply. As I mentioned earlier, in hindsight, we likely let sales get out too far in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California in 2012, so this year's strategy is to have a more measured and consistent sales pace in general, but particularly in these 3 markets.","I want to thank everyone for your time on this morning's call. Also, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup organization for their hard work and commitment, which is really at the heart of our improved financial results. The U.S. housing market continues to recover, and history would suggest that there's a long way to go before the industry gets back to normal volumes. We will continue to monitor what the impending impact of recent uptick in mortgage rates has in demand. Although as I said earlier, the industry can handle higher rates, assuming they are accompanied by more jobs, better consumer confidence and generally stronger economic conditions.","Again, thanks for your time. I'll now turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, to explain the process, let's get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Really appreciate all the color and commentary around your efforts on pace versus price and your comments -- really nice granular comments in terms of feedback from the field, in terms of the recent impact of rates. I guess, the only other thing I'd be interested in is, during the quarter, did you see a change in sales pace? Certainly, the description by brand was also very helpful in some of the more intentional efforts in Pulte, and so it might be hard to parse out seasonality out of these effects. But you said that traffic was consistent during the quarter. Can rates changed little? But any inter- quarter trends by region or by brand, I think, might also be helpful in understanding the recent movement in rates.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, this is Richard, thanks for the question. Generally, we saw consistent results throughout the quarter and I'll offer that we're pleased with the way July is unfolding as well. So no real change in traffic levels, sign-up patterns in general. You will note from our comments, we're pleased that our Del Webb performance is up. That's an area that we want to see continue to move forward, but pretty consistent throughout the quarter and so far, in July.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And I guess, kind of bigger picture, with regards to your comments and announcement on the share repurchase. Is this something that you expect to implement over the next couple of quarters on a shorter-term basis? And longer term, in the past cycle, there were only a couple of builders really that bought back shares on a consistent basis, really part of their cash flow strategy or free cash flow strategy. And those 2 companies that did that actually had very strong performance. Is that something that you expect to really inculcate into your cash flow approach on a real consistent basis? Or do you kind of see it more opportunistic at different points when -- just more of a -- again, an opportunistic approach?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, Richard again. I'll start and then throw it to Bob. We're really pleased that we're able to reintroduce the dividend and talk about a share repurchase plan. This is extremely consistent with what we signaled for the last 24 months. We intend to be more balanced with our overall approach to capital. And frankly, part of that includes our overall position on land acquisition. We're pleased that we're able to increase our spend this quarter in land acquisitions, substantially from Q1, that's in keeping with what we told everyone. But the watch word here is balance. I wouldn't want to get into any specifics with regard to share repurchase plans. We wouldn't want to signal any trading patterns or anything like that. But we do intend to be more balanced with our overall capital approach and part of that is returning shares -- or capital to shareholders. So with that, Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","The only thing I would add to that is, Mike, we think of it sort of 4 elements, right? We've got investment in the land -- in the business; we've got dividend payments; we've got share repurchases; and we've got leverage that we need to manage against all of those things. So I think -- if you -- against that balance comments that Richard just made, obviously, the dividend that we've just announced is roughly $20 million a quarter, so it would be $80 million a year. We have authorized up to 40% more spend. That would be the first 2 things that we would look at in terms of how we allocate available cash and cash generation. And then, you would look at the others. So I don't know that I would say it's opportunistic or not. It would be how much cash do we have available and what are the other uses that we've used for it and what's the underlying intrinsic value of the equity. So it's a -- something that we'll be looking at continually, honestly.","Operator","Your question comes from Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If we could just follow on that a little bit. When you look at your allocation into land, et cetera, do you expect to see community count growth? When will that start to turn positive? What do you think it will be like in 2014?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Steve, we had indicated nothing new on that front. We expect it to be down this year before bottoming some point into '14. We haven't given any further guidance. We intend to on our fourth quarter call as we start to ramp up projections for '14. We're certainly pleased that we're able to increase our land spend from $206 million in Q1 to $332 million in Q2 and you saw the lot count that we put under control in Q2 was a little over 10,000 lots. So a step up in activity. We'll have to see what that does to community count in the future, but no further guidance now.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as you look at -- right now, when you look at sort of the best use of cash and you go through -- in this early in the cycle, I would assume reinvestment is, is the highest use of cash and yet you all are already taking a pretty balanced approach. I guess I'm wondering what type of growth in the underlying business should we expect. Or is this going to be a fairly run flat type of business for the next year or so?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Steve, it's Bob. Following on Richard, we're not providing forward guidance, but we have been, I think, clear over time that we think today is the best investment dollar option for us in the business. Again, 40% increase for fiscal '13. And what we do is we actually invest in markets where we think we've got opportunities to enhance our relative market share or maintain it. So I think, no change from us in that regard. The only thing I would add to Richard's commentary a moment ago was, while we are increasing our investment, we are finding that we are buying more raw land than finished lots. And so there's a little bit further delay, obviously, in terms of when communities come online because of that.","Richard J. Dugas","And Stephen, Richard. One other thing I'd like to add, our real focus is on growing earnings and growing returns. And we think we've demonstrated nicely that we can grow earnings without relying strictly on unit growth, if you will. And we've done a nice job with that with margins. And as I indicated, we think there's more in that tank, to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Why don't you talk about the absorption pace at Del Webb, specifically, and it's great to see pricing up. Get a little bit of an idea of kind of how much of that was -- if there was any shift, either on product that's being purchased or even geography for Del Webb? And also, kind of how you think about the pace versus price at Del Webb given the kind of higher capital costs in the communities and the longer lives?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, David, this is Richard. Our pace is -- we're up about 15% in Del Webb overall, and we're really happy with that. It is, of the 3 brands, the 1 brand where we are not limiting sales pace, if you will, because we have such an investment. So again, under the mantra of ROIC, our goal is to drive more pace there. At the same time, our margins expanded nicely in that sector as did pricing come up as well. So we are seeing what we expected, that as the longer this recovery unfolds, the more and more Del Webb buyers come back into the overall sector. Our average selling price is up 10% in Webb with sales pace, absorption paces being up 15%, so a nice combination. In terms of geography, we're seeing strength in a lot of markets, and I'm pleased to say that some of the Midwest markets for Del Webb also saw some strength in the quarter, with a notable outside strength in northern California.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. And then just my second question was on cycle times and if you're seeing any extension in cycle times, or if you're able to kind of curb [ph] any potential extensions just through all the efforts you guys have been through on efficiency and trying to drive some process efficiencies?","Richard J. Dugas","And David, you\u2019re asking about house construction cycle times or...","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Exactly, exactly.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. So we are experiencing some minor delays in cycle times as trade availability is difficult. Having said that, we have a huge effort internally on overall efficiency, and we're real pleased with regards to that. Some of the extension with regard to our cycle times is a result of our option focus on substantial margin that we're driving from options, which is a change in the last 24 months for us as we've talked about. And Bob indicated in his prepared remarks, our option revenue is up. So we'll take that tradeoff. We think from an overall return blend, the incremental margin we're generating even if it's a couple of extra days and cycle times, more than pays off.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Richard, I guess, on the overall kind of balance between growth and units or top line and margin expansion, you guys have obviously done a great job driving the margin improvement and net-net sort of winning on the ROIC side there. But at what point do you see an inflection point where you can do both, sort of a balanced top line growth that may be matches the market or is closer to the market? And also, seeing the benefits of the cost improvements that are in place to drive the margin side? And what do you sort of look for as the key metric that can drive that inflection point? Because, I think, as you've talked about in the past, community count is a driver, but not necessarily the best driver as you guys think about it?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Dennis, that's a great question. And frankly, we feel like we needed to get our balance sheet in line and we needed to improve our overall capability in the homebuilding side before we got much more comfortable adding a lot more volume. We're at that point, and as you've seen, the 40% increase in authorization, Bob indicated is beginning to get into the business, the $332 million versus $206 million in total land and development spend in Q2 will have an impact in future quarters. There's no question about that. So I would tell you if you think about the business sort of separately, how much do you invest in land to kind of take advantage of the market versus how much do you focus on sort of your core homebuilding operation. We felt for a long time that we have a lot more efficiencies to gain out of our homebuilding operation, and we really, really work hard on that and feel really good about that now. So we certainly are not afraid to incrementally invest in the business, and we've made that decision several quarters ago, and we're beginning to kind of put that to work. Having said that, we are committed to a balanced approach. Don't look for us to go back to the days where Pulte was grow, grow, grow at all cost. We want to be balanced. We think our indication of a dividend and share repurchase authorization is good indications of that. We paid down more debt in the quarter. We really like our position. We're very financially flexible, and we're running a better business. So Bob, do want to add anything to that?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Nothing, no.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So as you think about the absolute pace, and this is a -- maybe you can add more color by markets. Do you feel like your absolute pace is in a sweet spot that you prefer between pace and price? Or would you be surprised to see pace slow even further and price accelerate further?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","That's a tough question to answer because you got to go by community. I would say this. I feel extremely good about how we ran the business in Q2. I think we did a really nice job squeezing everything we could out of the Pulte brand, which have seen a lot of strength. And we let the Centex and the Webb brand run a little bit more, especially the Webb brand. So it's hard to exactly say. I guess we'll have to look at supply conditions by community, overall. If we continue to see incredibly tight supplies in northern California, Seattle, some of these other markets, I suspect price is going to continue to go up. I mean, you heard us say that we took price from 1% to 5%, pretty much across the board, and that's going to benefit the future quarters, so really pleased with the blend. I felt like last year, as Bob indicated in his remarks, we'd let it get away from us a little bit in the early part of the year in some markets. We don't feel that way this year. I think we're doing a nice job, by asset, of maximizing our opportunity?","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The land acquisition that you all talked about, could you give us a sense for what kind of buyer mix is assumed as you're going out into the market? And the background for the question is essentially that you and most of the other builders talk about a mix shift that they've been seeing, whether because of tight credit partially -- and also just where the demand is. They're able to sell to a more of a move-up buyer than they historically done. And I'm curious as to whether your land purchases assume that, that mix continues into the next few years? Or if it assumes a reversion back to a more typical type of buyer in a more open credit situation?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Stephen, it's Bob. It's interesting. We don't actually ask our -- we're agnostic as to buyer group. So what we ask our land acquisition teams to do is focus on return. So which land parcels are they looking at, that can generate the best return? And what we have seen for 24 months now is that the opportunities that we are seeing are largely in the move-up space because that's where credit is more available. So that -- we've talked about that in the first time space, you can't get enough volume through to make the returns work. So most of our investments has been on the Pulte or move-up states. We also actually find that we're in certain markets looking at Webb transactions. We opened a new Webb in Raleigh, which has done very well since it opened. So I think it's really return focus for us rather than demographics when we're looking at land. I don't know if that answers your question.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, it does. But if I could push back on that a little bit more. I mean, that would seem to imply that -- an assumption that the move that we've seen, the mix shift that we've seen is not a cyclical phenomenon or is not a phenomenon that will reverse at some point when credit availability improves. But my suspicion would be that most folks, including yourselves, would assume -- would believe that credit availability will, at some point, improve, which would almost de facto mean that you would have more entry-level buyers entering the market. And therefore, all of those return metrics that you use for land investment would then change and make the entry-level look more appealing than it does today. So I just was curious as to why you don't feel it's prudent to maybe introduce an element of that kind of adjustment to the analysis. And then one last question, if I could, is the lumber. I know lumber prices have declined earlier this year. Have you seen the benefit of that yet or is that going to be more of a 3Q event?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","On the lumber, it will be -- actually probably later than Q3. It's actually out beyond that because as pricing comes down now it will be closing to see probably first quarter of next year. And then on first time -- to your commentary, I think we believe that, yes, that in an environment where we're getting back to more normal volumes, the first-time buyer will have to be a more important part than they have been over the last 2 years. And so I think, as we see return capability coming, we would invest in that land portfolio. And it might come as, if prices continue to escalate closer to the job core, you might see people moving out just for affordability and that's more of your first-time buyer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Without giving forward guidance and, I guess, this is addressed to Richard. How much upside do you see in gross margin going forward? Is it marginal, or is it meaningful?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Bob, we'll stick with the similar commentary we have each quarter. We see upside from here, and I'm pretty pleased with the upside that we see in our backlog, and that kind of gives us visibility for roughly 6 months or a couple of quarters. So we continue to execute against our common plan management strategy. We continue to drive a bigger percentage of our closings. Bob indicated only about 30% of our closings in Q2 had benefited from that process. I expect that to ramp up on a consistent basis quarter-after-quarter. So I would suggest that the margin opportunity we have in front of us is not insignificant.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. You're increasing your land spend sequentially, which is terrific. Community count continues to go down. New order growth turned negative. Do you expect kind of given the reinvestment in the land and your efforts, which I applied to manage price versus pace, do you see that turning back to the positive territory?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. We wouldn't want to comment on exactly kind of what comps will do over time. I will tell you this. We're extremely focused on earnings growth and return growth, and unit metrics got us in trouble in the last cycle by paying too much attention to that and trying to chase volume. We weren't making as good a land decision. So I feel very good about our ability to grow earnings and grow returns from here. But don't have a lot to say about what sign-up trends may do. It's going to obviously be reflective of what the broader market does and how quickly we can get communities online, which we don't have any update on at this point. But it's about driving earnings and return on invested capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Gentlemen, obviously, Bernanke in the last month or so, builders not necessarily reporting surging candidates or slowing of orders. But if investors are focused on the volume side and the builders, the industry is focusing on price and pace comments, at least for most builders, what's happening is the out-year volumes are getting pushed farther out. Why wouldn't this imply lower overall cyclical volume or kind of a mid cycle slowdown, despite the fact we're below 1 million starts right now? Especially given that the builders have taken share in serve markets, it seems as though the pace and price comments can go so far. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of price. But I mean, why doesn't it just imply lower volume? I mean, is it the labor side, is it -- this isn't what builders historically have done, slow the pace.","Richard J. Dugas","I think it's a great change, Ken. Frankly, I think the industry, we've talked about before, has some systemic issues, right, not much land has been entitled over 4 or 5 years of downturn. I think we all gobbled up the opportunistic finished A locations a couple of years ago. Bob just indicated that most of our spend now is going into raw, which extends time frames out a little bit. I don't think anybody here is suggesting that the industry volumes don't come back to normal. The question is, what's the capacity of the industry to actually get us there? And I would suggest land is more of a constraint than anything. I think the labor will continue to come back into the space. It might be a quarter or 2 hiccup here and there for builders. But I think it's an extremely healthy change. I think builders have learned their lesson by focusing too much on volume, volume, volume, and certainly, this company has.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about July. So the trend was very good, but wondering if there's any color you can give by segment, or just, overall, where -- especially in the Centex segment in terms of the first time where looking at some of the backlogs that was closing in July or is going to close for August. Any issues encountered on the mortgage side of the buyers who hadn't locked in? Just how you're viewing the environments overall there?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Dan, we're not providing any granular guidance. We're just saying that we've seen a continuation of good trends in traffic and sign-ups through the first 3 weeks of July, so don't have any more detail on that.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, secondly, in terms of the capital allocation, you talked about having a much more balanced approach to it at this time. But then, certainly at this point, the best option is continued investment in the business. Assuming [indiscernible] wanting to have the flexibility there, I think in prior cycle we've seen companies where there's more a structure around it, where it ends up being disciplined. The question is this, as you look at the opportunities, as the cycle progresses, how do you sort of shift and say, \"Okay, we had thought that this was the best option for reinvestments, but now we should focus more in terms of the share repurchase or dividends here.\" How is it that you're going to think about that shift? Certainly, it's a good thing to have this flexibility, but how do you look differently about -- at the allocation?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, hopefully, we won't look differently at it over time. It is, again, first and foremost, we think the best return we can generate on our cash are in the business. We've got a criteria that we're using to approve land acquisition. And so I think you can expect to see us continue to invest in the business doing that. And obviously, we've introduced the dividend. And so I think on balance, over time, if we have available cash beyond that, we would consider whether it made sense to put more in the business, pay down debt or repurchase shares or increase the dividend over time. So we have lots of -- Richard said earlier, we have flexibility, so I don't think there's anything concrete that we're going to say, \"If this, then that.\" It will be more of an evaluation as time goes by.","Richard J. Dugas","And Dan, just to add to that, to give you an example, just within the land acquisition space, if you're going to appreciate this. If we're looking at 5 transactions in a given market, we are being disciplined to only purchase 2 or 3 of those. And we really like what that's doing to our overall portfolio. We continue to approve high returning transactions, with less risk, with more upside to the company. And we're just having a conversation internally over the last couple of weeks about how the land that we have put under contract in the past 12 to 18 months it's really going to benefit the company, we believe, in the future. Whereas if we had not had the discipline that we have had, maybe we would have bought all 5 things we were looking at. So it extends beyond just the choices of what to do with our capital, but even within each segment, particularly on the land side being smart about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. You mentioned some of the order trends by product line, and I think the pricing that was up 10% for Del Webb. I wanted to see if you could comment on absorption levels and what's that's been trending kind of on by product line, and also the pricing for the other 2 product lines?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Sure, ASPs, quarter-over-quarter, up 9% to $294 million. That's what we talked about in the call. That was up 8% in Pulte to $350,000. It was up 2% to $197 million for Centex. It was up 10% to just under $300,000 for the Del Webb segment. Sign-up -- gross sign-ups were down 20%, as we've talked about for Pulte, 18% -- down 18% for Centex, up 8% for Del Webb. On pace, it was down 8% at Pulte, and again, that's reflective, I think, largely of what happened out with Southwest. Paces were up 14% for Centex as we've talked about up 15%, this absorption basis for Del Webb, so an aggregate 4%.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the metering of sales comments, you mentioned, I think, 2\/3 of your markets, you're metering sales in 10% of those communities. So if you were to look at that kind of on an overall basis as a percentage of your communities, what percentage are you metering sales? And then, what's the kind of average differential in margin on those communities where you're metering versus not metering?","Richard J. Dugas","Rob, we haven't gotten into that much detail. I will remind you that we said that in several markets we're metering sales in 50% or more, so we don't have an exact number for you there. And then average margin differential is going to be very asset specific. So even in a market where we're metering sales in greater than 50% of the communities, we could have one asset there that was not well positioned that had low margin. So it's very difficult to answer that. But it's fair to say that we like the way that this is playing out for us. We think we're maximizing return.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Roxland of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As we've had hiring, and given all the various markets who participated, are there any particular markets that you think can best cope with rising rates? And are there any markets that you would consider pulling back from as you perceive there that they're more susceptible to a rising rate environment.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, I would first go to which segment can most deal with the rising rates and that's the Del Webb buyer. Approximately, 1\/3 of our investment and our assets positioned in that business. There tend to be 40% or greater of those buyers who pay cash and those that do take a mortgage, take a very conservative mortgage. So rather than isolate a given geography, I would first lead you to that segment. Then I think, certainly, the Pulte category, the move-up category can probably weather the rate increases next best, if you will. And then, I think the category that would get hurt the most would be the entry-level category overall. In terms of geography, you just have to -- look, excuse me, at where our assets were positioned. So we have a pretty good balance with the vast majority being in Pulte and in Del Webb. So I wouldn't single out any one particular market that I think would be impacted the most.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Then if I recall, a couple of quarters ago, maybe 1.5 or 2 years ago, you were talking about something like independent series product. Given the rising rate environment, is that a product that you're still pushing? Or are you still more heavily targeting 2 potentially, let's say, first-time home buyers?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, it is. We continue to invest in the Centex brand and the entry-level category in total with our goal being to ensure that the product is very affordable. Having said that, as Bob indicated, we're not finding a lot of land transactions at this point that return exceptionally well in that category. So our future investment has not been geared as much. But it doesn't mean we're not trying to monetize the existing assets that we have and maximize our profitability in those and part of that is a more efficient home construction process due to the independent series.","Operator","And your last question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you elaborate a little bit on what the charge from the contractual dispute is? I mean, that seems like a pretty big charge if you consider the potential for the additional $40 million?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. So this is a luxury community that was built, again, in a market where we're not doing business anymore. And it's a contractual dispute with homeowners that essentially, it relates to the amenity package that was built, their access to that amenity package. Again, we've had arbitrations, ongoing discussions for settlements. So the $30 million that we've provided is what we actually think this is going to cost. The reason we highlighted the incremental $40 million is it will be in our 10-Q. We are required to say is it possible that there will be some bigger number and what's the range of that. Obviously, the range is 0, meaning the $30 million estimate is correct. But depending on how the negotiations go, in theory there could be more. That $40 million would be a, in our view, an absolute worst-case scenario.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, can you -- what is it surrounding in terms of the amenity package. I don't quite understand what the dispute would be.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","It is an amenity package that is owned by a third-party and the access rights of the owners of the units within the community was in question and essentially, contractually, they thought they had more access than ultimately they were provided, and so have challenged us on the basis of how the units were sold to them.","Operator","I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Richard J. Dugas","Great. Thank you, operator. I just want to thank everybody for their time this morning. I know it's a busy day for a lot of you.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","Jim Zeumer","Thank you, operator, and good morning. This is Jim Zeumer, Head of Investor Relations for PulteGroup. I want to welcome you to our conference call to discuss the company's fourth quarter financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2014. Participating in today's call to discuss our results are Richard Dugas, Chairman and President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President and Financing Controller. Let me remind everyone that copies of this morning's earnings release along with presentation slide that accompanies today's call are posted to our corporate website at www.pultegroupinc.com.","We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. This risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. ","That's it. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard Dugas ","Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Early in December, we hosted our first Analysts and Investor Day in almost a decade. Our goal in hosting the meeting was to provide a comprehensive review of our value creation strategy and the underlying initiatives which have driven its success over the past four years. The topics of our Investor Day included a review of the significant operating and financial gains we've realized as we work to deliver higher returns on invested capital. And assessment of the opportunities that remain to realize additional gains in revenues, gross margin, overhead leverage and overall construction and asset efficiency. And finally a comprehensive analysis of our focus on capital efficiency and our related approach to capital allocation. For those of who you are unable to attend, I'd certainly encourage to review the presentation which is posted on our website. ","I am extremely pleased to say that the strong financial performance we delivered in the fourth quarter and the full year demonstrates the ongoing success of our efforts. In a couple of minutes Bob will provide a detailed analysis of our fourth quarter results and gains we've realized. So let me spend my time looking at our full year 2014 progress against our value creation strategy. On slightly lower unit volumes we generated a 4% increase in home sale revenues to $5.7 billion. The much more telling number however is our ability to leverage the 4% revenue growth into a 33% increase in reported pretax income of $635 million for homebuilding operations. Inclusive of our financial services operation, we realized pretax income growth of 31% to $690 million. The significant increase we generated in 2014 pretax income was supported by our strategic pricing and common plan initiatives along with interest savings from our dramatic debt reductions over the past few years. In combination, these factors help to expand our reported 2014 gross margin by 280 basis points to 23.3% and pretax margin by 250 basis points to 11.8%.","As we've done over the past several years, we capitalized on our strong operating performance and associated cash flows by implementing a disciplined allocation of capital, which included investing $1.8 billion into our business in 2014, an increase of roughly 40% over 2013. We are also in position to comfortably expand our plan 2015 investment by another 30% to $2.4 billion, but only if we can identify high returning projects. ","We retired $246 million of debt in 2014, helping to reduce our yearend debt to capital to 27% among the lowest in the industry. We returned $321 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and after all these we still ended the year with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet which is available for planned investments and to fund dividends in any future share repurchases. ","We are extremely pleased with these results and I am personally very proud of the entire organization for all the hard work they have invested to make them happen. Given the significant gains we've realized over the past several years since launching our value creation strategy in 2011, we remain committed to this program and the ongoing benefits we believe we can deliver. As such we will continue to focus on margins, overhead leverage, inventory returns, return on invested capital and disciplined capital allocation.","Back in 2010, we analyzed 20 years of financial and operating data on our company and our peers. The findings clearly show that company is generating the highest return on invested capital drove the greatest total shareholder returns over the housing cycle. An ROIC focus should have value in all market conditions, but we believe it can be particularly effective during the sustained but historically slower paced housing recovery, we expect will continue for the next few years. By focusing on returns, we've controlled our investment and land assets and lowered our house inventory by reducing specs and accelerating cycle time. Having raised our return on invested capital above our cost of capital, our land investment spends is moving beyond maintenance, and is now supporting future growth. Consistent with our operating strategy this would be higher return growth not just investing to churn out higher unit volumes.","And as we demonstrated in 2013 and 2014, if the appropriate land transactions are not available, we won't force investments into the system but we'll continue to use our capital to fund ongoing dividend payments and repurchase shares. At the same time, we continue to advance our common plan management work and related initiatives to squeeze additional efficiencies out of our construction operations. Many of you got to hear from Ryan Marshall, Harmon Smith and Mike Wyatt at the Investor Day. So you can better appreciate how much we've accomplished and yet how much opportunity remains to be realized. ","Overall, I view 2014 as another year of great progress relative to our value creation work. Equally important I think we enter 2015 in a strong overall position with opportunities to drive additional operating and financial gains. ","Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bob for discussion of our fourth quarter results. Bob?","Bob O'Shaughnessy ","Thanks, Richard. And good morning. I'd like to echo Richard's comments for 2014 marked another significant step in our progress and highlight that the fourth quarter represented strong finish to the year. Beginning with the review of our income statements, home sales revenues in the fourth quarter increased 10% over the prior year at $1.8 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 7% increase in closing volumes to 5,316 combined with the 3% or $9,000 increase in our average selling price to $334,000. The increase in our average selling price reflects higher sales prices at all three of our brands. In the fourth quarter Centex is up 1% to $212,000, Pulte was up 5% to $406,000 and Del Webb was up 4% to $327,000. The mix of closings by brand changed only slightly from last year's fourth quarter with 45% of closings coming from Pulte communities, 30% from Del Webb and 25% from Centex. ","Our fourth quarter gross margin was 23.1% which is down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year, but up 20 basis points on a sequential basis. Our stable Q4 margins reflect a number of factors including the company's efficiency and pricing initiatives, interest savings from our significant debt pay down, the mix home closed as well as change in labor material and land prices. In addition, although the land market is competitive, we believe our focus over the last few years of investing in well positioned, higher returning land assets has helped support our margins.","Fourth quarter option revenue per closing increased 11% or $4,800 over the prior year while lot premiums in the period decreased 5% or $680. Sales discount for the quarter remain below at just over $7,000 or 2.1% for home compared with approximately $5,500 or 1.7% for home last year. We've said for a number of quarters that discounts are likely approaching their lower limit so the Q4 change should be viewed as typical and quarterly variant and not a shift in our pricing strategy.","As we've said the company's future margin performance, there is clearly a number of macro and local market forces at work. In this volatile operating environment, we continue to focus on our value creation strategy and we'll respond to local market challenges on a community by community basis. Based on our view of the market and considering the company's specific opportunities we see in strategic pricing and construction efficiency initiative, weighed against the challenging competitive dynamics in the market, we are targeting full year gross margins in 2015 to be consistent with our current level of 23% with the proviso that we expect they will be moving up or down as we move from quarter-to-quarter including previously discussed Q1 headwinds from acquisition accounting adjustments associated with our Dominion transaction.","SG&A costs for the fourth quarter totaled $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues compared with a $150 million or 9.3% last year. Our SG&A expenses for the period was benefited by approximately $15 million or $0.03 per share from reversals of construction related insurance reserve. The reduction to our insurance reserves is not directly tied to the insurance charge we took in the second quarter of this year reflect typical adjustments based on actuarial assessments of our construction related exposures which trended modestly better than projected in the second half of the year. ","Looking at our projected overhead spend in 2015, we expect our SG&A will be in the range of $160 million to $165 million per quarter, which is consistent with our underlying spend in Q4 of this year. The increase over 2014 relates primarily to investments we are making in support of our value creation initiatives and in connection with the increased number of community tool we will be opening and operating this year. ","As noted in our press release this morning, we recorded a charge of $8.7 million, or $0.01 per share for lease exit cost in connection with the relocation of our corporate offices to Atlanta. The charges recorded another expense net and were anticipated in the original cost estimate we provided when our relocation was announced.","Our financial services operations reported pretax income of $13 million in the fourth quarter, which is up from $7 million last year. In the quarter, financial services benefited from higher volumes and decreasing interest rate which drove higher gains on mortgage sales. Capture rate for the period improved to 81% from 79% last year. In aggregate, our pretax income for the fourth quarter was $267 million, which is up $35 million or 15% over the prior year. ","Closing out our review of the income statement, we reported $50 million of income tax expense which represented effective tax rate of 19%. It should be noted that our fourth quarter tax is reflect benefit of approximately $50 million, or $0.13 per share associated with the regulation of a certain federal and state tax matters as well as adjustments to our state deferred tax asset valuation allowance. ","The company's normalized effective tax rate in the quarter was 38%, which is lower than our original guidance of 39% for the full year. At this time, we expect our 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 38%. On the bottom line, reported net income for the fourth quarter of $217 million, or $0.58 per share. Included in this result for the tax and insurance benefits of $0.16 per share partially offset by the lease exit charge of $0.01 per share. ","Moving out to homebuilding operations. At the end of the quarter we had a total of 5,059 homes under construction of which 26% were spec. As a percentage of construction activity, this is comparable with the prior year. At year end, our finished back inventory amounted to only 483 homes, keeping us below an average of one per community. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 8,800 lots for purchase which brings our total for the year just over 22,000 lots. One interesting note about our Q4 land transactions almost 60% of the lots were for Del Webb communities including four new positions and an extension of our highly successful Georgetown community outside Boston, Texas. Given the timeline for developing these positions, we expect these projects will impact our operations in 2016 and beyond.","We spent $539 million on land acquisitions and development in the quarter, bringing our total land spent for 2014 to approximately $1.8 billion. Consistent with recent quarters, our spent was split equally between development and acquisition. As we noted at our Investor Day, our spent this year was less than our authorization of $2 billion. As a result, the authorization of $2.4 billion for 2015 includes the $200 million remaining authorization from 2014 as we seek to allow our local homebuilding teams to manage their capital investment programs over time with any eye towards driving investment in high quality high returning transactions.","We finished the year with 131,000 lots under control of which of 35,000 or 26% were controlled via option. Of our controlled lot approximately 25% are finished with another 18% currently under development. Looking at our 96,000 owned lots as measured against our 2014 deliveries of 17,196 homes, our own lots supply is approximately 5.6 years which is two years lower than we maintained in 2011. We are pleased with our progress on this metric given its significance to our overall return on invested capital. ","As we have demonstrated throughout the year, we are actively allocating capital beyond our land investment activities. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our stock for $98 million, or $18.87 per share. This level of activity is roughly twice the level we executed during each of the first three quarters of 2014, and is consistent with our announcement at last quarter that we had increased our repurchase authorization by $750 million. We put the extended authorization in place with the intension of using it and clearly we are. ","Based on our strong operating performance, we ended the year with $1.3 billion of cash despite the significant investments we made during the year in land and our return to shareholders of $321 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We expect to use this capital over time in the fashion we laid out at our Investor Day. Our debt to capital at the end of the quarter was 27% which is down from 31% last year. ","Few final data points. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 sign ups to increase 1% to 3,232 homes which on a dollar basis increased 2% to $1.1 billion. Unit signs up increased 4% at Pulte while slipping 3% at both Centex and Del Webb. Fourth quarter absorption paces were down 5% at Centex and 7% at Pulte while Del Webb closed out a very strong year as absorption paces gain 10% in the quarter. The lower absorption paces for Centex and Pulte were impacted in part by a decision to slowdown and in some cases stop sales at several Columbus and Louisville communities as backlog levels have gone too far extended. Excluding the impact of the Columbus and Louisville operations, our absorptions paces were essentially flat versus the prior year. ","We finished the year with 598 communities which are up 4% from the end of 2013. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect to operate out of approximately 600 to 620 communities in each quarter of the year, up from the 560 to 580 range for 2014. Plans calls for opening over 200 new communities in 2015, so it will be another busy year for our operations. ","Finally, we ended 2014 with a unit backlog of 5,850 homes valued at $1.9 billion compared with 5,772 homes valued at $1.9 billion last year. ","Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments. ","Richard Dugas","Thanks Bob. As we typically do, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions we experienced in the quarter. At a regional level, on the East Coast, we continue to see the same general pattern that existed throughout the year with demand getting stronger as you move from the North East down to the South East and into Florida. The Carolina, Georgia and Florida in particular were among our strongest markets. Demand in the middle third of the country experienced the similar pattern with conditions improving as you move from North to South. We have purposefully slowed sales in the roughly 30 communities we acquired from Dominion in Columbus and Louisville as delivery dates on the acquired backlog and new signs up were out too far. We are working hard as we speak to get builds cost down and strategic pricing tools established in both of these markets. ","As was the case throughout the first nine months of 2014, Texas was strong in the fourth quarter with demand improving as we move through the period. We are certainly monitoring conditions to see what impact lower oil prices ultimately have on housing demand but thus far in January demand in Texas continue to be strong. We have read the articles on Texas' economy being more diversified than in the past and how the benefits of lower gas prices nation wide provides a big tailwind for the overall economy. We appreciate the potential for lower oil prices to impact the Texas' economy. Like everyone else we have to see how this plays out in 2015. We are fortunate in that our investments are diversified by brand in each market and geographically diversified across the markets of Texas and across the country.","Fourth quarter results were generally stable out west although conditions were volatile over the period. California principally the coastal and bay areas, Arizona and New Mexico held up well during the quarter. Our newest Del Webb community called Mirehaven is just opening for sales in Albuquerque, so we are looking forward to seeing how these performed in the year.","Relative to our expectations, we are pleased with the fourth quarter demand trends which suggested positive momentum was building as we move through the period. On a year-over-year basis, we generally experienced higher traffic levels and signs up volumes and held up except for our actions to slow pace in Columbus and Louisville as we move through the period. We've seen a continuation of these positive traffic and sign up trends in the first few weeks of January which we consider a good sign heading into the important spring selling season. These recent demand trends are consistent with our optimistic view as we head into 2015 with expectations that housing demand continues on a slow and steady recovery path that we have been discussing for the past several years. We are mindful however that there are lots of cross currents which will impact individual markets differently and make demand challenging to predict. Overall, we believe that the positives and the improving economy with declining energy cost, rising employment, lower mortgage rates and related fees beneficial long-term demographic trends in a generally healthy supply of inventory should be able to offset any headwinds the industry may face. ","The reality is that we can't control the U.S. economy or the housing markets. What we can do is concentrate on running the best business we can. For us, this means continuing to improve the returns on invested capital we generate over time by capturing efficiencies in our operations. It also means implementing a supportive capital allocation program that in this order seeks to first invest in projects to maintain or grow relative market share while achieving required return thresholds. Second, fund an increasing dividend. Third, selectively engage in return accretive M&A and fourth, distribute any residual capital through systematic share repurchases. ","Let me close by thanking the employees PulteGroup for their hard work to successfully implement our strategies and for delivering the tremendous gains we realized in 2014. I believe you are the best team in the industry. Also, I want to thank you and our suppliers and trade partners for your enthusiastic support of PulteGroup's built on a program. I am proud and humbled by your efforts.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","Jim Zeumer ","Thank you, Richard. We will now open the call for questions. So that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Shawn, if you explain the process, we will get started. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Ivy Lynne Zelman. Your line is open. ","Ivy Lynne Zelman","Good morning. Great job on the presentation guys and solid quarter. Richard, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the mortgage environment given some of these policies changes as well as maybe challenges on why people can't get approved, what the main reason, please?","Richard Dugas","Sure. Ivy, good morning. From the mortgage environment the changes that the President announced few weeks ago, I honestly think it is too early to see how they play out. Having said that, I am very optimistic and certainly I think my peers are optimistic that they are meaningful changes. As you know, the mortgage environment has been tight overall and the FHA fee change announcement allows several hundred thousand new potential buyers to qualify for FHA mortgages. So we are optimistic and as we noted in our commentary we believe that there was a demand shift that began sometime around Thanksgiving that began playing out in December. And we certainly saw positive trends through the first weeks of January.","Ivy Lynne Zelman","And can you comment on why people do get denied when applying for mortgages maybe as Centex operations and some of the impairment that you guys see that are lingering or challenging? Because it seems this FHA have pretty lean underwritings to get those people with credit scores low and low down payment. So what are the reasons when people can't get approved? ","Richard Dugas","Yes, Ivy, I think it is couple of things. I guess primarily down payment difficulty. I think underwriting standards with regard to FICO scores and debt to income ratios and things like that have been stringent for some time. And I think the big impairment is down payment scores and then of course lenders wanting to lend in this environment so that the changes in FHA I believe are significant. That 3.5% down payment threshold with proper supportive appropriate underwriting guideline is a very effective program. I think the folks at FHA would tell you that the quality of the book that they have been writing last several years is outstanding. So I think down payments are an issue overall. And that to me is one of the big impairments, one of the reasons why FHA is so important. So we are very optimistic that the changes that we've seen with these recent announcements will have an effect. I think it is little too early for us to say whether that's driving the improved activities we are seeing yet or just people being more optimistic in general about housing. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko","Hi, good morning. Richard in Analyst Day you talked about a net debt cap number 30% to 40% longer-term target. Obviously you are below that now, with the pull back in the long end of the curve just thinking about where your head is at around maybe layering a little more balance sheet leverage and how we can think about that line going forward?","Bob O'Shaughnessy ","Yes, Jack, it is Bob. I think the answer to that is it will depend on our investment levels, it will depend on our capital outlets for other things, and share repurchases being the driver that largely-- certainly as we look at our leverage we've got maturities in fiscal 2015 that are relatively modest. Then we've got bigger maturity in fiscal 2016. And so as we think about we will look at the long end of the curve, we'll also think about we've got -- we've already got paper out there. It might make more sense to start building the latter in the sort of 5 to 10 years window. And I think it's really going to just depend on what the capital market is like when we actually are in a position where we need to issue some debt.","Jack Micenko","Okay, great. Let's just say 2015 is maybe the year of return of the first time buyer, how quickly can you ramp Centex? I mean we always think about third, a third in your business mix and the other two have been fairly successful where demands has been at, but can that number rise above 30%, can you pivot fairly quick to meet that demand? ","Richard Dugas","Jack, this is Richard. I guess first and foremost I remind everyone we still have a big Centex position and just like we've seen with other segments the first place you will see in same store sales growth. So I am very confident that we can capture our fair share of that activity. In terms of new investment, it is likely an 18 to 24 months cycle so we could put dollars to work now if we saw that activity improving, that could benefit say the end of 2016. It is not an immediate turnaround. In some cases it can be quicker than that. As an example in Texas, the market is little bit easier to access land and you might -- it might have a little bigger impact for 2016. I think it is fair to say that 2015 is baked, but I remind everyone that the first place improved demand shows up is in same store sales growth and as we commented on Del Webb and Pulte before, it is quite a bit of leverage we can get from relatively deep land position we have there as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Just talking little bit more about the capital allocation et cetera and maybe Bob this first question is for you. If you look at it $2.4 billion in land spend, you spent about $300 million for next year and you spent about $300 million in dividends and repurchase, ignoring any type of M&A, are you comfortable with that number being -- those combined being around $3 billion or so and with that where would you like -- where would you feel comfortable with your cash balance dropping down to?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes we certainly look at liquidity and it's not just cash, its availability under our revolver and it can be substantially below where it is here. I don't want to say $250 million or $500 million because it is really going to depend on the timing of cash flows and obviously the way the business works, a lot of our closing volumes in the back half of the year. And so if we spent a lot of money early in the year on land and development, we might go a little bit lower on cash and then expect to recoup which is closing to the back half of the year. So it is not a hard and fast rule but certainly we could live comfortably between $250 million and $500 million and actual cash","Stephen East","Okay. So having a $3 billion type number out there is not a big stretch and I guess when you look at it? ","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes. I don' want to -- I don't want to say what we are going to spend on share repurchases because that will happen over time, but I think order of magnitude, you are absolutely right.","Stephen East","Okay, fair enough. And then if you look at -- Richard, that was helpful on Centex, how long it would take to ramp up, if you just look at your land spend in 2014 and then perspectively in 2015, could you talk about where you put money regionally? Where you are going in 2015 and is there any switch among the other buckets other than Centex? ","Richard Dugas","Yes. Stephen from a geographic standpoint given the stringent standards we have, it is fair to say we allocated an appropriate amount of money across the country. I don't think there is any one geography that stood out. We are certainly being cautious in some of the places that we have a long land balance as we work hard improve returns. And as an example we have a very large land balance in the DC area, we have a large land balance in Phoenix. So we would want to be appropriately focused and not get too far ahead there and continue to drive our turns. As relates to segment, we have in 2014 continued to put most of our money in Pulte, Bob indicated though we did see a ramp up in Del Webb's spend in the fourth quarter in terms of approved transactions. That's going to ebb in flow up and down, those don't come in evenly. So I'd expect in 2015, we are going to get predominantly Pulte branded approvals with some Del Webb and Centex I think is a TBD. We didn't do a whole lot of it last year. We got to see that activity continue to ramp up before we really push the accelerator there. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg.","David Goldberg","Thanks, good morning, everybody. I was -- last quarter I was wonder if you could talk a little about competitive environment at Webb. And now you kind of mention for the business for homebuilding generally certainly competitive and some of the competition maybe doing a little more incentive and discount little bit more. So could talk about the Webb business? I know prices up 4% this quarter you mentioned but what's the environment, how is traffic been and are you finding that buyers are looking for more incentives or more discount as they come in the door?","Richard Dugas","David the Webb environment is probably the least competitive of all the segments that we deal in because the uniqueness of the offering that we have. We certainly have good competitors there. Shea Homes is a very good competitor obviously some of our larger peers like Lennar Hovnanian others have competitive offerings. But Webb is we believe unique. What we find there and this is consistent with what we've seen two past cycles, those buyers not nearly as price sensitive as some of the other categories. What they want is confidence in the economy and confidence in their ability to sell their existing home which is clearly improved through 2014 versus what it was say in 2012 and 2013 which is why we've seen absorption paces lead in Q4 there. And I'd expect good things out of Webb this year. We typically see them being a latter cycle play in housing market and that continues to play out, so I don't want to give anyone the impression there is no competition there but it is certainly an area that we have the ability to push margin and price more than some of the other areas because of the lack competitors but also frankly because that buyer category is less price sensitive in general. ","David Goldberg","That's fantastic. And then Richard I want to ask a bit of a follow- up question. You mentioned in your comments about kind of maintaining market share or growing market share as you look forward and you look at the growth in within your closing and kind of flattish year-over-year up a little bit year-over-year from where we are now, what I am trying to get an idea is with community count that you have big then and the guidance you gave, do you think that would position or you would kind of maintain market share versus the overall market, do you think you grow faster than the market or do you think it is too hard to determine I mean like that just based on the community count growth. ","Richard Dugas","Yes. David it is tough to know what exactly our competitors are going to do but I'll just remind everyone a couple of things. We were much disciplined about not pushing investments until we got above our cost to capital. That happen for us sometime in 2013 and that's when you begin to see us accelerating our investment to more than I think it has script indicated maintenance mode and more in a growth mode. How that relates to our ability to take shares is going to be really depended obviously on what happens to the market and what our competitors spend. I'd expect that over a period of time not necessarily today or tomorrow but over a period of time that we are going to be able to grow our share but one of the factors that we are focused on internally is the concept of relative market share and meaning our size in the market vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. And we believe that if we can have relative market share somewhere around 0.5 or greater that captures the majority of the efficiencies that we can get in a market. So our goal has been to push our relative market share to at least that level in every market and in many were much greater than that. And for those markets where we have not been able to achieve that either figure out a way to get there or get out of the market. And we've been much disciplined with that. So how does that relate to overall market share growth, it is really hard to say? Clearly, we are focused on generating high returns and as you can see with our community count guidance, growing our business in general but I wish I could give you a more definitive answer on market share but it is a little too complicated to answer that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless. Your line is open. ","Jay McCanless","Good morning, everyone. First question I had was going back to Centex. Do you see the opportunity either through acquisition or through loosening of the mortgage standards to maybe increase that neighborhood counts. I know you've all been asked to this a couple of different ways but just after the commentary we heard on the third-quarter call I was surprised not to hear more about Centex and where you're going with that.","Richard Dugas","Well, Jay, I'll remind everyone that part of what we acquired with Dominion was Centex. I don't remember the exact percentage but the sizable piece of that business was that first time category. So there is a good example of our desire to get into that space where we feel like the terms and price points and financial transactions matter. So we are paying attention to this category but we said consistently before we need pace to continue to come back to ensure that returns get there. Now again I'll just remind everyone that we like overseeing these last few weeks and couple of months with the market. So that could be the beginning of an opportunity for us to begin and invest more in Centex. So we are going to not force investment in the segments that don't generate the highest returns for us and we are certainly hopeful that Centex becomes a bigger part of that equation. But we are going to watch the market to make sure. ","Jay McCanless","Okay. And then just a follow-up question I had is on a Del Webb. Are you seeing an increasing amount of cash wires there? Are you seeing people come with more --either of higher down payments et cetera? Just wondering if you are seeing more well-heeled buyers starting to get into that market and helping to accelerate the sales pace there?","Richard Dugas","Yes. It has been fairly consistent, Jay. We've been sort of in the 40% to 45% range for cash buyers, cash as a percentage of the total Del Webb category overall. Not a big change in the financial profile. Again this buyer category is quite different from either Centex or Pulte, in that they have a large asset base built up; they are less concerned about income. It is more about cash flow and their overall position. Their financial position and what we tend to see with this category is that if they feel good about the economy and their own financial position, they tend to increasingly want to buy. For the Del Webb buyers, it is really not a question of whether they want a new lifestyle, they clearly do, it is a question when they are comfortable pulling the trigger. And as we've seen slow and steady improvement in that category which should continued to bear out in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener. Your line is open. ","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen. I appreciate your gross margin outlook. Given that it's fairly steady, could you comment on what gives you the confidence in giving that guidance given the overall pressure we're seeing from gross margins from some of the larger builders. Some are highlighting lower margins to go after high returns. Others are just saying we're at a high-level, let's smell the coffee. Can you express where your confidence comes from? Is it that your common plans are giving you that lift or is it that because you didn't buy high-priced land that would be helpful. Thank you so much.","Richard Dugas","Sure, Ken. This is Richard. A number of things, we highlighted few of these things in our script but number one common plan management and efficiency of production, we believe continues to make a difference for us. So that's part of it. ","Ken Zener","Would you quantify that? Or you just ranking them?","Richard Dugas","It is very hard -- no, I am not ranking them but you asked about the different factors. So let me just kind of give you them. Number one is the common plan management and that's clearly important to us. Two would be our strategic pricing focus. We do have a very disciplined focus on lot premiums, option pricing, ensuring that we have a systematic base price increases when we can. So we are being disciplined there. We also are very proud of land that we have been buying. We believe that our focus on land has been very disciplined and focused on high return, that's all. I'll also point that our limited spec inventories helping us. We are not discounting a bunch of finished bag and frankly that continues to weigh on our margins very positively. We've also got lower interest costs that are coming through as a result of all the debt we pay down and we are very proud of that. So when you add this all up it equals what we call value creation. It is a road to higher returns over time to generate the best possible total shareholder return and we believe we are on that road and well on that road. We are doing well with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hello, thanks for taking my question. Richard, I guess the follow on Ken's question on or to a certain extent of the margin side. It seems like strategic pricing still obviously a focus. You've got backlog that looks kind of flattish. Pricings flattened out. Community count growth is going to improve a little. It seems like the way your setting up for the business is for a fairly low revenue growth at least for this year, for maybe some investments kick in. Is that fair?","Richard Dugas","Mike, we are not commenting on our revenue targets or unit targets overall. I would just remind everyone that we are executing our playbook. We increased investment into the business starting 2013, we clearly ramped up in 2014, we are guiding to our more investment in 2015. It does take time for that investment to flow through. We are staying disciplined on it overall. So we are very happy with our overall trajectory and sometimes we wish we could push a button and community would pop open. We are facing entitlement delays and development delays just like other people are. But in the scheme of it we like to slow and steady progress that we are on. We feel like that benefits investors. We are really being smart about the land that we buy not getting out ahead of ourselves. And if you were to walk around our communities and talked to our leaders around the company, they would tell you they are focused on returns. And a portion of that is of course pretax income growth. But a portion of it is also inventory returns and SG&A leverage and all the other pieces. So I am just trying to run balance business, Mike.","Michael Dahl","Got it. And, I guess, as a follow-up, and Bob I think you've commented that you expect SG&A to be in a dollar range of $160 million to $165 million per quarter. So I guess did I hear that correctly? And, if so, that seems to imply that you potentially de-lever by maybe 100 basis points or so. So just how to think about that and what the opportunity or timeframe of re-levering the SG&A would be?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes, obviously, you are right. We are projecting an increase in our spend and it is for all the things that we are working though. And sometimes you have to spend in advance obviously we are opening a lot of communities. This year opened a lot of communities last year, so there are costs associated with that. I think if you take a step back what we are proud of is -- you look at our operating margin for 2014 and it is -- excluding the construction defect accounting in the second quarter 13%. So we are paying attention to our spend and choosing where to invest. So I think we are delivering on the bottom line and trying to be disciplined about that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim. Your line open.","Stephen Kim","Can you guys hear me? Okay, sorry about that. Yes, very interesting call and obviously good result. I guess a couple of questions related to your guidance on margins. You just has put a lot of emphasis on return on invested capital. But not -- but than giving guidance on the gross margin but not really giving guidance on the revenues, what strikes me about that, that's interesting is that most of the others builders that are talking about somewhat lower gross margin with a little bit more volume are also talking about return on capital and talking about the fact that they are able to sort of tolerate a somewhat lower gross margin because of the fact that they are just simply focusing on return on capital and now sometimes require more volume, expense to margins and that's okay. I think counter return on capital guidance figure from you and I was curious if you could give one because just giving a gross margin kind of guidance number without a revenue number doesn't really seemed to be consistent with the focus on return on capital. So I was wondering if you can give some more guidance on the return on capital. ","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes, Steve, this is Bob. We have not historically nor did we today give guidance on what our goals are. What we've said consistently over time is that we seek to improve it. You heard Richard say we got our cost to capital, our returns exceeds our weighted average cost to capital sometime in 2013. We are moving that forward. We've got a lot of cash. We wanted to manage through that. We have large deferred tax asset. So our investment profile, our invested capital profile is a little bit different than we might like. So rather than set a target that gets measured against your goal is improvement. And we think we've been doing that and expect to continue to do that. ","Richard Dugas","And Steve, this is Richard. I'll just add a little bit of color, to add emphasis to what Bob said. We want to improve returns over time. The way capital flows into this business is lumpy at times quarter-to-quarter. There can be volatility but clearly over time we want to improve returns. We've got one builder in this space that has outstanding returns. And we are in second place the way we measure it. And we want to close that gap over a period of time. So just because we didn't give an ROIC target for a lot of reasons, don't think for a minute we are not focused on improving it. ","Stephen Kim","No. That comes through loud and clear. Great, thanks very much for that. So with this focus on returning I want to then shift a little bit to the gross margin because what's interesting is that you're talking the flat gross margin outlook for 2015, but you have three sort of distinct businesses, you have the Centex, Del Webb, Pulte, and I was curious if we should be thinking that in general your gross margins will be flat next year in each of those three sub-categories or if you are envisioning that one may start to drive negative year-over-year margins, but that others would be up and so the aggregate would be flat. If you could just help me understand how widespread is going to be?","Richard Dugas","Yes, Steve, we're not breaking it down in that much detail. What I can tell you is that Webb continues to and Pulte continues to deliver higher margins than Centex does. Again our operators are incented. Their pay systems, our pay systems for the senior leadership team are all focused around return. We continue to focus a lot on margins though because we believe it's a big driver of return and we've seen what has done for us. I'll just point everyone to the comment Bob made around operating margins. When we got operating margins excluding the charge we had to take in Q2 last year around 30%, we're pretty proud of that. So we're continuing to focus on that. So I would just leave you that Webb and Pulte higher than Centex overall in margins, but the volatility within each of the guidance within each we are not providing that level of detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland","Mike Roxland","Thanks very much. And congratulation on a good quarter and a good year. Now there a bit lot of questions on Centex on this call thus far so really I don't want to be dead horse here, but just one quick follow up. Obviously you've seen some of your competitors begin to focus more on the first time buyer; you yourself have seen some improvement in Centex, ignoring what some of weakness in 4Q. At what point do you start to become more constructive on that cohort and begin investing in it, and is there any particular metric that you look at that we get you over the hurdle. And if let's say if that metric is return their type of return hold that must be clear before you start actively investing. Can you just help us frame how you would get comfortable putting deploy more money into the Centex? ","Richard Dugas","Mike, I'll take stab and then Bob can give you some additional color. We have 13 point risk weighted scale for the way we invest in all of our land. And all the different factors that go into that include things like the link of land transaction, whether or not we are building the same product. And the market's performance et cetera, number of factors and the return threshold range from around 20% up into the low 30% category. So our focus for when to invest in Centex is when we can generate returns in that band between 20% and 30% effectively. And the fact that we talked about repeated that we believe drive Centex over that 20% threshold is pace. Because that buyer unlike the Pulte or Del Webb buyer has a limited amount income to spend, there is only so much you can do on pricing side with the Centex buyer before you price them out of their home. So as an example if you are selling four homes a month in a Pulte community and you are selling four homes a month at a Centex community, if Pulte is generating 25% margin and Centex is generating 19% margin, it is going to take more pace than four per month in order to get those returns where we need them. So you might need six or seven homes a month in a Centex community and make that work. So that's what we are looking for. And perhaps we are beginning to see -- the beginning of that with the improvement. But it is generally pace so Bob anything you add there. ","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Exactly, I can say only thing and to emphasize is it is not as if we've told people don't invest in Centex today. We are agonistic to brand. So the local investment and operating team are actually evaluating transactions against each other with the capital they have to spend over time. And so what Richard has laid out plays out such that today the move up in Del Webb transactions look better to us from a return perspective, that's why we are investing.","Mike Roxland","Got it. Appreciate all the color there. Can you just drill down little further though say if you look at the return threshold 20% to 30%, can you give us an idea where returns currently stand on your Centex product? And what the current paces on an absolute basis versus your targeted pace to achieve the 20% to 30% threshold?","Richard Dugas","Mike, it is little complicated because a lot of land that we are sitting on for Centex, we might have acquired five years ago, some we may have acquired two years ago. So they kind of current returns -- obviously a project when it gets to the end of its life generate higher returns than in the beginning when you are putting a lot of capital in overall. I would yes we are driving each of our current communities to the highest possible return. And that's like balancing the knobs in an airliner try to adjust all the different pieces. So for Centex it might be pushing pace a little bit more than price kind of given the dynamics that have indicated. I think the commentary we are trying to provide is around new investment or future investment we need to get over that 20% return hurdle which is a way we look at it before we invest a lot of additional dollars there. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut. Your line is open. ","Mike Rehaut ","Thanks, good morning, everyone. First question I was hoping just delve in a little more granularly in terms of the gross margin component that being interest expense amortization, you had a great improvement in 2014, you listed it as one of the drivers, I think about 130 BPS.","I would presume that is expected to continue to come down in 2015, I was hoping perhaps you could give us a range or an outlook for that as percent of sales.","Richard Dugas","We wouldn't do it necessarily, Mike, as a percent of sales, haven't given sales guidance but what I can tell you is what we expensed in fiscal 2014 was about $195 million. And you can expect that number to come down probably to around $140 million next year. Reflective of the fact that we are -- have much less leverage, our cash spend on interest is in the neighborhood $130 million or $140 million a year. So we will get to the point where we are expensing what we are capitalizing. ","Mike Rehaut ","And so before my second question, Richard, that $130 million, $140 million, with that kind of be where it is stabilizes unless you take a lot more debt off the balance sheets?","Richard Dugas","Yes, obviously depending on what we do. So we paid down some debt this year. So what we capitalize in 2014 which will get amortized over time is less than what was capitalized the year before. So it is kind of like FIFO if you think about all the counting analogy.","Mike Rehaut ","Right. And then just lastly, Richard, I think you referred a couple of times to December and January trends being a little bit better. If I'm characterizing that right. A little bit momentum perhaps. I was hoping you could review the trends let say throughout the quarter? Other builders have pointed to perhaps competitive activity intensifying a little bit. And I just was curious if you had seen that yourselves because certainly the December\/January commentary suggests otherwise possibly?","Richard Dugas","Yes. Thanks Mike. So let me just kind of take everybody back a little bit to 2014. The year started off from a sales pace perspective I think for everybody really strong. And definitely we noticed a pause sometime in a summer that continues through most of the fall. What's notable is that around Thanksgiving things started changing. And so to answer your question, we sold virtually the same number of homes in October, November and December which candidly very rarely happens. Normally you sell lot more homes in October than you did in December and you see the quarter trail off, so that was notable in our minds. And then January has continued to be quite positive. So from a competitive activity standpoint, it is hard to say. Candidly we are not trying to play the spec inventory drive a bunch of volume, push incentives in order to drive a bunch of volume gain, so perhaps we are not focused as much on sort of what's happening from a discounting perspective as maybe others are. I can just tell you that overall buyer activity I think was weak in the beginning of Q4 and improved through Q4 based on that trend and is continued into January.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","And before we move, Mike, I just want to clarify something, in terms of the interest expense side, I had indicated $140 million, you said $130 million to $140, and I would say it is probably $140 million to $150 million rather than $130 million to $140 million just for everybody's benefit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thanks. I wanted to ask about the share repurchases. The increase in the share repurchases in the fourth quarter relative to the earlier quarters of the year. Was that driven mainly by just the seasonal cash flow is obviously stronger cash flows at the end of the year or lesser need for land purchases. What was the kind of driver? Was it opportunistic?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Well, I think we talked about this at the Investor Day. And we announced the very significant increase in the authorization. It really comes down so we have the capital to do it. As we look at the cash balance that we have -- if really interested either or conversation around land investment, so we elected to increase our spend on repurchasing shares knowing that we were increasing our spend on land as well.","Richard Dugas","And Nishu as we indicated on our Investor Day, it is not our goal to try to be opportunistic. If something happens and we have that opportunity then we always have that option, but our goal is to more systematically and routinely return funds to shareholders but I'll just remind everyone, invest in the business first, dividend improvement second, accretive high return M&A third, and then repurchase is fourth. And we have a good discipline about the way we are going about that today.","Nishu Sood","Got it. And the second question everyone tends to think just about Texas and oil prices. You have one of the broader footprints of the public builders. Are there any other markets you are keeping tabs on or would be potentially concerned about as it relates to lower oil prices or is it pretty much just focus on Texas?","Richard Dugas","I would turn that around to tell you I am pretty optimistic about the rest of the country because of a huge tax rate that everybody just got with a lot lower gas cost annually. So clearly there are other markets that have more energy dependence if you will Nishu than others. But I don't think anyone to the same degree as Texas. And potentially California and market or two but I am personally I am optimistic that the cash flow implications for people's monthly cycle based on gas price are a positive factor from oil prices being depressed. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall.","Bob Wetenhall","Good morning, and thanks for all the color. Obviously, really good quarter. Just wanted to get your view on land costs what you are seeing. Obviously, your spend flow down last year and you came in lower than your original targets. What are you seeing from land prices today and do you think that there is a possibility you might come up short and have to redeploy the excess cash elsewhere this year?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes. Bob, it is Bob. I don't think we slowed down our spend. We didn't spend everything we authorize and that's again consistent with the year but still a 30% increase in our spend. We are projecting another 40% if we can find an investment that makes sense. Is it possible we won't spend that much money? Yes. Just like we did in last year and I'd say the same thing we said a year ago. We are okay with that because we want people to do it, because things we are trying to give our team's visibility to is a multiyear capital allocation so that they can plan accordingly. And if we've just said okay we authorize to this year and then take it away, they will be induced to spend it because they don't want to lose it. So we think it drives better behavior to say, look, one thing we haven't shared with this group broadly is we've actually given the field three years of capital allocation. So they know today what they have for 2015, 2016 and 2017. And we will give them a view of 2018 at some point. That the idea being manage your capital over time. And so I know we all focused on this call around the current fiscal year what we are going to spend. As a company, we are actually looking longer term than that because the market is still competitive. I don't know that we would say, okay, if we spend $2 billion next year instead of what we've targeted would we then turn around and write a big dividend check or buyback a lot of stock. Not necessarily, it would be depended on what we thought we are going to do over time.","Bob Wetenhall","What do you think with the land prices? ","Richard Dugas","Bob, it is Richard. Land prices are competitive. No question about them. Unfortunately we've got a very broad footprint. We are not -- as Bob indicated forcing investment into any particular geography. We allocate capital to geography and if we can't find right deals, we don't spend it. So land is competitive. I don't personally think that's news. And I expected to stay competitive. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger.","Adam Rudiger","Hi, thanks. Two questions on the Dominion acquisition. The first one was the purchase accounting impact this quarter and what is the expected impact is for next quarter? ","Bob O'Shaughnessy ","Yes. So it is about a 70 basis point headwinds, so detrimental margin impact in the fourth quarter and our expectation is between 30 and 50 basis points in the first quarter next year.","Adam Rudiger","Thank you. And the second question relates to your comments about slowing or stopping sales that Columbus and Louisville communities. How much is that -- at first glance I'll make that, we will make it sound like those were ultra strong market. So my question is, is that the case or how much of that is a philosophical or structural difference in the way you want to run the business versus how they ran the business? ","Richard Dugas","It is 100% the latter. Although we are happy with the markets and we think the market dynamics are good and appropriately strong. But frankly we have way too much backlog out there in front of us. So, Adam, we are very comfortable with few months of backlog. But we don't want to get seven, eight, nine months of backlog because we think we lose pricing power. It also gave us the opportunity to intensely focus on common plan management, getting our frankly more efficient plans in place and what they have been building in Dominion and then also implement some of our strategic pricing focus with lot premiums and our option focus. The teams are fantastic. They are really working hard and doing a lot of work to kind of prepare for reopening a number of communities both existing communities that we stop as well as new community. So very pleased with what's happening there. But it was just philosophical difference and frankly driving return versus growth. ","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Will Randow.","Will Randow","Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a follow up on the land color. I was curious if the markets like Texas in particular you are seeing competitors back off or it get less competitive in regards to land? ","Bob O'Shaughnessy","It is interesting. I can't say what's happen in the last 30 days but certainly have approved a number of transactions there including one of the Del Webb. And I would tell you for well positioned assets people are still interested. So it is not like the demand goes away from the builders immediately.","Will Randow","Got it. And then in the South East, are you seeing competition stepped up? I would assume so based on number of acquisition among competitors.","Richard Dugas","Will, it is Richard. I think the South East has been historically pretty competitive. I haven't noticed a big change in that dynamic. We happen to have some pretty dominant positions. Our two operations in North Carolina and South Carolina are fantastically run. We do very, very well there. So I'd say it is continued to be competitive but we are doing very well. ","Bob O'Shaughnessy","And for the extent that they bought somebody, it is just different name but they are still the same builder there with the same lot position initially. So it doesn't change the competitive landscape immediately.","Operator","There are no further questions. Presenters, I turn the call back to you. ","Jim Zeumer","Great, thank you, Shawn. I know there is a lot of conference call lined up today. Sorry we ran a little bit long in this call. We wanted to get in as many people as we could. We are certainly be available for the remainder of the day if you got any follow up questions. Thank you for your time. And we look forward to speaking with you in next quarter.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir.","James Zeumer","Great. Thank you, April, and good morning. I want to welcome all participants to PulteGroup's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call a little later today.","I want to highlight that as part of today's call we will be discussing our reported results as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impacts of certain significant items. A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning's release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results.","Also I want to alert all participants that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today at our PulteGroup's strong third quarter operating and financial results. We continue to realize top and bottom line growth driven by the business strategies and capital allocation priorities we've executed over the past several years.","As reported in this morning's release, even with the severe weather conditions in Q3 our 11% increase in sign-ups, 100 basis point increase in operating margins, and 40% increase in adjusted earnings per share attest to the strong financial performance we were able to deliver. Before we discuss our results in detail, I want to provide a few comments about hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the impacts they had and are having on our business.","First and foremost, I'm thankful that we can say that all of our employees are safe and we're actually working to support members of our team whose lives were disrupted by the storms. In less than 48 hours PulteGroup employees contributed well over $100,000 which the company in turn matched to aid any employees impacted by the hurricanes. While I was not at all surprised by the outpouring of support it was still gratifying to see.","We we're also fortunate in the damage to our communities in Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas was minimal. More specifically, none of our homes under construction, our models, or our sales centers were flooded or suffered significant wind damage. Depending on the specific market once the storm surpassed our communities were fully operational within a few days to a couple of weeks.","That being said, the process of closing down and then reopening approximately 175 communities at various times resulted in the loss of numerous selling and construction days across multiple major markets. These disruptions were compounded by the resulting impact on the consumer in the days leading up to and after the storms. Rather than estimating the number of potential sign-ups that were lost we can tell you that the sign-ups in July and August were up roughly 15% over last year, but that increase fell to just 3% companywide for the month of September resulting from the disruptions in Houston, Florida and coastal Carolinas.","Two takeaways from these numbers, overall buyer demand was robust in the quarter and the slowdowns caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma were significant. Customer traffic has improved in the weeks following the storm, but as I'm sure you can appreciate, the process of recovery has varied by market.","One final point that I would like to make relating to the storms is that while trade labor availability has held up a little bit better than we expected, we are certainly incurring higher prices for that labor and the associated materials. In addition, municipal resources needed for permitting and\/or utility crews to bring power to communities and homes have been strained. Fortunately, municipalities are beginning to wind down hurricane response activities which is allowing them to shift more of their resources toward builder related permitting. At the same time the utility crews are being freed up to work on connecting power to new homes.","In summary, the damage from hurricanes Harvey and Irma could have been much, much worse, but we did and will continue to feel the impact on our business for several quarters. Despite the hurricanes, there are so many positives to be taken from our third quarter results. As Bob will detail, we continue to realize meaningful growth in our business with an 11% increase in sign-ups and a 9% increase in homebuilder revenues compared with the prior year. We were then able to compound this topline growth into 40% growth in adjusted earnings per share.","I would emphasize the point that we are not just growing for growth sake, rather we are operating in alignment with our strategic focus on delivering higher returns. For the trailing 12 months ended September 2017 our return on equity increased by more than 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period and is now about 14%. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter and our year-to-date performance and with our third quarter backlog at a 10-year high we are well-positioned to deliver strong full-year results.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a more thorough review of our quarterly results.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. As Ryan discussed, our third quarter results were impacted by the severe weather that disrupted our businesses in a number of important markets. Where possible, I'll highlight some of the areas of impact as I review our third quarter financial performance.","Starting with sign-ups our net new orders in the quarter increased 11% over the prior year 5300 homes. It is worth reiterating that as a result of the hurricanes we experienced a meaningful drop in the year-over-year growth in sign-ups in September as compared with our business in July and August. Our reported Q3 sign-ups were also impacted by cancellations related to a fire you may have read about at one of our 50-unit low rise buildings in the Boston area.","The building which was effectively sold out will need to be raised and rebuilt. As a result, 33 customers elected to cancel their contracts rather than wait 12 months for the new building to be completed. We are trying to find other housing options for these buyers, but these 33 cancellations reduced our reported year-over-year growth in sign-ups by about one percentage point. The fire will also impact future closings which I'll address shortly.","Looking at 11% increase in Q3 sign-ups a little more closely, we experienced higher sales of our first-time [indiscernible] buyers partially offset by a decrease in sign-ups among active adults. For the quarter sign-ups among first-time buyers increased 24% over the prior year to 1611 homes and sign-ups among move-up buyers gained 16% [ph] 2443 homes, while sign-ups among active adult buyers decreased 9% to 1246 homes. The decline in active adult sign-ups was largely due to [indiscernible] in Houston, Florida and our costal Carolina markets related to the hurricanes.","Adjusting for community count our third quarter absorption pace was up 1% over Q3 of 2016 and reflects a 15% increase among first-time buyers and a 2% increase among move-up buyers partially offset by our lower active adult sales.","Turning to the income statement, home sale revenues increased 9% over the prior year $2.1 billion as we continue to benefit from the increased investments we have made in our business in recent years. These higher revenues were driven by a 7% or $25,000 increase in average sales price to $399,000 in combination with a 2% increase in closing volumes of 5151 homes. At 5151 homes closings for the period were below the low end of our prior guidance range. The lower closing volume for the quarter was primarily the result of hurricane related delays, with delays in permitting and other municipal approvals particularly in the West also negatively impact Q3 closing results.","Breaking down our Q3 closings by buyer group, 28% were first-time, 47% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the third quarter of 2016 closings by buyer grew by 29% first-time, 44% move up and 27% active adult. At quarter end we had 10,439 homes under construction. Based on our assessment of the current production environment, we currently expect to deliver between 6400 and 6700 homes in the fourth quarter.","This estimate reflects the impact of lost construction days, trade availability and municipal processing capabilities in storm affected markets. Our Q4 estimate also reflects the loss of all closings from the building in Boston that burned and which had been scheduled to deliver in the quarter.","As noted previously, our average sales price for the quarter was $399,000. The higher average sales price was driven by the modest mix shift toward more move-up homes combined with higher selling prices realized across all buyer groups. For the quarter, our average sales price of first-time home buyers increased 5% to $293,000, move-up increased 5% to $467,000, and active adult increased 9% to $390,000.","Looking at our backlog ASPs also continue to rise increasing 10% to $431,000. I would note that geographic mix is impacting this quarter from quoted backlog as higher sign-ups from California, particularly Northern California, resulted in higher average sales prices.","Looking at our margins our reported gross margin was 23.9% which is up 50 basis points sequentially from the adjusted gross margin we realized in Q2 of this year and in line with our previous guidance range of 23.6% to 24.1%. Our gross margins continue to be supported by our ongoing focus on capturing more option revenues and lot premium dollars wherever possible. For the quarter option revenues and lot premiums increased 8% or approximately $5600 over last year's $76,200 per home.","In the quarter incentives as a percentage of gross sales improved 40 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of this year but were up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Looking at the fourth quarter we expect gross margins will come in towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of 23.6& to 24.1%. This estimate considers the impact of the storms which will result in the delay of certain high margin closing in parts of Florida, the loss of the building in Boston as well as higher labor and material costs being incurred in certain markets.","Looking at our overheads, reported SG&A for the third quarter was $237 million or 11.6% of home sale revenues which includes a $5 million charge related to the resolution of certain insurance matters. Prior year SG&A of $251 million or 13.3% of home sale revenues included $12 million of charges for restructuring costs resulting from actions to reduce our workforce as well as costs associated with shareholder activities.","Based on our strong operating performance and the increased leverage our overheads resulting from the actions we took in 2016 our third quarter operating margin improved to 12.3%. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year operating margin guidance of 11.7% to 12%. Note that this guidance excludes the impact of the significant items we highlighted during the first three quarters of the year.","Turning to our financial service businesses we reported pretax income of $18 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter last year. The decrease in pretax income was primarily driven by a more competitive pricing environment for mortgage originations. Mortgage capture rate for the first quarter was 80% compared with 81% last year. In total, the company reported pretax income for our third quarter of $268 million which compares with $212 million last year. We also reported third quarter income tax expense of $91 million which represents an effective tax rate of 33.8%. The slightly lower tax rate relative to previous guidance was driven by certain state tax law changes along with a benefit from stock option exercises and other employee stock transactions during the quarter.","Looking at the bottom line we reported Q3 earnings of $0.58 per share which represents 57% increase over our prior year reporting earnings of $0.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company's Q3 earnings were $0.60 per share which represents a 40% increase over our prior year earnings of $0.43 per share. Diluted earnings per share for Q3 was calculated using approximately 300 million shares outstanding which is a decrease of 42 million shares or 12% from 2016. The lower share count resulted from the company's share repurchase activities.","Turning to the balance sheet we ended our third quarter with $197 million in cash on hand after spending $260 million to repurchase 10.4 million shares of our stock at an average price of $25.11 per share. Through the first nine months of the year we've repurchased $660 million worth of stock and expect to complete the targeted $1 billion of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. As always, our decision to repurchase stock is subject to market conditions. Consistent with prior guidance that our share repurchase activity would modestly increase our leverage in the short-term, we ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 42%. While this remains just outside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%, we expect to move back inside the range in 2018.","I want to also highlight that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we retired $123 million of bonds that matured. We also exercised the accordion feature of our bank revolver providing us an incremental $250 million of liquidity.","Finally, moving over to operations, we had 10,439 homes under construction at the end of the quarter which is an increase of approximately 1,200 homes or just over 13% compared with the end of the third quarter in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher sold backlog units as specs fell to 22% of homes under construction. We remain disciplined with regard to production and spec inventory as we entered the quarter with only 576 finished spec homes.","For the quarter we operated out of 778 communities which is an increase of 10% over the prior year and is in line with our guidance. As is our practice we will provide guidance on 2018 community count when we release earnings in January.","In addition to our share repurchases we used $295 million of capital in Q3 for new land acquisitions. This brings our nine months spend to $773 million and keeps us on track with prior guidance of investing approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition in 2017. During the quarter we approved 52 deals covering approximately 5,500 lots or an average of just over 100 lots per community. Consistent with our stated goal of wanting to be more asset efficient and return friendly, 46% of these lots will be optioned.","Inclusive of the parcels put under control in the quarter we now own 90,400 lots and control another 48,800 lots under option. This increases the percentage of our land controlled under option to 35%. We're pleased with our progress as we continue to successfully build our land pipeline to support future growth while providing added flexibility and greater asset efficiency.","Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan?","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Bob. Before we open the call to questions let me provide a few comments on the housing market and the demand conditions we experienced in the quarter. The last release from the Census Bureau reported the seasonally adjusted annual rate of new home sales for the country at 560,000 which was little change from last year. Based on our results and feedback from our divisions we would tell you the demand in the quarter generally felt stronger than the government suggest and more in line with the 5% to 10% growth that many are forecasting.","Certainly the hurricanes make comparisons in certain market specific analysis a little more difficult, but overall we're very pleased with the demand environment. As has been the case for the past few years housing demand is benefiting from the strength of the overall economy. Going forward we expect that the ongoing job and wage growth, high consumer confidence and historically low interest rate environment can support the continued growth of housing demand.","And while interest rates have moved a little higher, I don't think that the modest increases had a significant impact on buyer demand. With an 11% increase in sign-ups it should come as no surprise that I would say demand in the quarter was solid growth across most of our markets. More specifically we saw generally good demand on the East Coast although cancellations caused by the fire in our New England division along with the impact of hurricane Irma in Florida will distort our reported results. Sign-ups in the Southeast were positive, although we are still seeing some choppiness at the higher price points in certain communities.","In the middle third of the country we continue to be pleased with traffic and demand in our Midwest markets. The incredible flooding in Houston obviously impacted Q3 demand in that market, but overall we experienced good traffic and demand trends in Texas overall. And finally out West we would consider our Western markets to be among the strongest in the country with particularly high buyer interest in Northern California, Arizona and Nevada. Through the first few weeks of October we continue to see good buyer traffic with the typical seasonal patterns heading into the fourth quarter. We are looking forward to a strong Q4 and a continuation of the good demand conditions experienced through the first nine months of the year.","In closing, I want to thank all of our employees for their tremendous work during the quarter. Whether you were taking care of our customers or each other I'm extremely proud of your efforts during some very challenging conditions.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James Zeumer","Great, thank you Ryan. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one followup. April, if you'll explain the process we'll get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Dahl with Barclays. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Dahl","Hi thanks for taking my questions. Just starting off on the kind of the storm impacts and hopefully how things have progressed post the quarter, more really in the quarter, so two pretty different storms impacting Houston and Florida in terms of kind of types of disruption that we were seeing in damage. So could you give us a little bit more color on how you're seeing those respective markets recover if one is proceeding or rebounding faster than I guess your proactive Florida markets versus Houston, anything you can give us on how things were progressing over the course of September and early October?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Mike, good morning, this is Ryan. As I mentioned, kind of at the end of our prepared remarks we've actually seen buyer demand rebound quite nicely in both Houston as well as in Florida. The damage and the implications for the storm were very different in the two geographies. I'll start with Houston, a lot of the work that's being done there is related to drywall, paint and trim and as we indicated in the prepared remarks we are seeing pretty good labor availability in terms of labor being there, but we are paying a little bit up for that labor and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we've rolled that into our margin implications for Q4, but from a demand standpoint we're seeing that market recover pretty well.","I'll move to Florida, the damage there was mostly related to clean up, landscaping, and the power grid. The power grid and the kind of the associated power crews that we need to energize new sites, hook up power meters, energize new homes, et cetera, that was definitely strained as was permitting and permitting related activities in the municipalities, because those community leaders were focused on storm recovery. We're starting to see that kind of break free and we're getting back into what I would characterize as a normal environment.","Southwest Florida is one that I would highlight, it's a very big market for us, that's where the hurricane made landfall and some of the most widespread damage was in a broader sense and so that particular market from a buyer demand standpoint hasn't quite recovered where we would have expected it to. So I think I touched on everything that you had there Mike?","Michael Dahl","Yes, you did and I understood and I know this is difficult, but if you look at the margin impact that you're forecasting collectively between the delays of high margin communities, the labor materials, the Boston community, is there any way you can parse out the relative magnitude of those and you know how we should if you have any initial thoughts on you know clearly 4Q is one quarter out but as we look out into 2018 how we should be thinking about those impacts?","Ryan Marshall","Yes we didn\u2019t parse it out and it certainly has had an impact. But you know the guide that we gave at the end of our second quarter for the back half of the year was 23.6% to 24.1%. We had a sequential improvement of 50 basis points over the second quarter going to 23.9% in this quarter. For the fourth quarter we still anticipate staying within our guide, but as Bob mentioned in his remarks will be towards the lower end of that guide and that factors in the impacts we're expecting from higher labor costs and the loss of those higher margin communities.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Timothy Daley","Hi this is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu. So I just wanted to touch a bit on the capital allocation for 4Q and then kind of looking into 2018? So first I was wondering how much of the share repurchases have been done quarter-to-date through I guess October 23rd or 24th? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about the land acquisition versus development spend that was guided to previously in the year and I think it was 1.1 and 1.6 respectively, are you still on track for that total to be around 2.7? Thank you.","Ryan Marshall","Yes, we haven't provided any update on repurchase activity in the fourth quarter. We did indicate that we currently expect to complete the $1 billion share buyback so that would obviously show that we're going to be buying during the quarter. In terms of the spend, yes we had just under $300 million of land spend brings us to just under $800 million, so we had guided to 1.1. We think we will be just around there and on development spend yes we think we'll be here the guidance we've given at the beginning of the year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Lovallo","Hey guys it's actually Pete Gallo [ph] on for John. Good morning.","Ryan Marshall","Hey John.","John Lovallo","I was wondering if we could focus on Slide Six, Bob giving really good detail there around kind of the owned optioned strategy going forward and I guess just from a higher level is there any kind of timeline out there in terms of, how long it would take you just organically to get to that 50% option range? And then I guess part B to that question would be, is there any reason why you wouldn't target that closer to 60% or two-thirds kind of options over the long term?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, it's a fair question and I think we've been pretty consistent over time that when we look at optionality what we're really looking for is market risk transfer. And so it's not about putting money source between us and the land, if it doesn't transfer that market risk because that's actually too expensive.","So what we really get down to is on an transaction-by-transaction basis are we able to affect a structure that actually serves both parties where we actually are able to manage our market risk by creating optionality and asset efficiency. So I don't know that there is a - we have to be at 50% at any one point in time nor what I say that we were targeting two-thirds or whatever, if we can get there great, but it really is sort of a transaction-by-transaction dialogue.","Ryan Marshall","Pete, this is Ryan. The other thing that I'd just add in there is, one of the things that is, one of the things going on in the entire industry is land entitlements are taking longer and so part of the reason that we set the milestones at 50% owned, 50% options is I think it gives us the predictability of our forward business that we believe we need. It also takes into consideration the impact of our Del Webb assets which tend to run a little bit longer than a Centex or a Pulte branded community. So I think Bob hit the nail on the head. What we're really looking for is risk transfer, more option is generally better, but as governing guidepost for the your organization we think 50-50 is the right mix.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone. I was hoping to focus a little bit on how you think about growth over the next couple of years and understanding that that there are different levers obviously to create value, but over the prior - before this year in prior couple years, community count growth was a little bit more modest or flattish. It started to increase or it's starting to increase, how should we think about 2018 and 2019 where you have different peers of yours kind of targeting maybe either mid, high, single digit or low double-digit overall volume growth? How does community count growth figure into that as I'm sure you have one, two, three year plans in place?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Mike good morning. This is Ryan. We haven't provided any guide to 2018 at this point as Bob mention in his remarks we\u2019ll plan to do that as part of our Q4 call. We\u2019ll give you some guidance ranges for next year including community count. I think you've seen from the land investments that we've been making that we've certainly been growing our land pipeline which as you know will translate into community count and volume growth over time. We have been putting up some pretty strong growth numbers this quarter being yet another one this year with a 11% growth and I think it's reflective of how we've been increasing investments into the business.","We've talked for a while that we want to grow with or even above the market and so I think at a broader level that's how we're thinking about our growth prospects for the future is that we'll be keeping up or growing slightly faster than the market.","Michael Rehaut","I appreciate that Ryan. I guess second question I apologize this was asked earlier, but in terms of labor materials in Texas and Florida how are those markets trending right now in terms of the inflation trends that obviously have been an issue even before the hurricanes hit? Obviously it's still probably pretty early days, but certainly wanted to get a sense if you have any intelligence on the ground in terms of any changes that you might have seen to the labor pool in particular and what kind of expectations that you might have next year in terms of any change in labor availability or cost?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, so Mike, we're seeing generally pretty favorable availability on labor but we're paying for it, specifically in Houston. That's the place where we're seeing premiums being paid predominantly around drywall, trim and paint labor. We've been able to keep the labor on our job sites but we have had to pay up for it. A little bit of the same thing going on in certain parts of Florida, again the labor is there but it is coming at a premium given some of the recovery efforts.","The one that I'd highlight Mike, that I think has a national impact which we're paying very close attention to is lumber. Lumber was on an upward trend even before some of the catastrophic natural disaster events that we've seen over the last 60 to 90 days. So that's the one that I think we all need to be paying attention to for 2018. I think the premiums that are being paid for labor in Houston and Florida that will subside in time. the lumber impacts could be longer lasting.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. Can you hear me?","Ryan Marshall","Hey Stephen, good morning. Are you there, Stephen?","Stephen Kim","Yes, sorry about that, I had some technical difficulties there, can you hear me?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, good morning.","Stephen Kim","Okay, okay, good morning. Sorry about that. I wanted to turn the question to land spend and your approach to land and I was gratified to hear your answer to an earlier question where you indicated that it wasn't as simple as just simply talking about the share of your land in units which are optioned. I agree with that.","It seems to me that, the best way to maybe think about it is in terms of land dollars spent. I think you had indicated that you spent $228 in the quarter for acquisition. I didn't get a development spend number. I assume it was probably around $500 million, but I wanted to see if you\u2026?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, to clarify it\u2019s 295 of land acquisitions spend in the quarter and development was $382 million.","Stephen Kim","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you for that. Okay and so that would bring you at about a low 30% of revenues which is kind of what it looks like you're going to be maybe spending for the year give or take a little bit based on what you indicated your goals were for the year. And my question relates to what amount of land spend do you think you need to maintain current sales rate? So I'm assuming like basically 15% revenue growth let's say. If you were to carry that forward and say we want to run our business to be able to meet that kind of top line what level of land spend would you need on an ongoing basis?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","That's a hard one to answer Stephen because the mix matters, price points that you're buying cost of land in the markets you're looking at how much is optioned. So it doesn't serve to answer that generically. Right I know that\u2019s not a real answer for you, but it really depends on mix and how you're buying.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you. Congrats guys on a strong quarter.","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Ivy.","Ivy Zelman","You know Ryan could you talk a little bit about affordability? We get a lot of questions about concerns with the strength of home price inflation. Are you seeing any pushback from consumers and we haven't really seen too much of it but obviously your markets, you're seeing strong demand? Are you seeing any resistance? And maybe thinking about mortgage underwriting and what you're seeing on the credit side is allowing any incremental consumer ability to buy pricing power despite pricing power, maybe give us a little bit of color around the horn to just talk specifically about Northern Cal which is one of the markets that you know we've heard a lot of concern around, Denver and some of the other markets in the Western areas seem to be the most concerning to investors?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Ivy good morning. What I would tell you around credit availability is it's generally okay and in fact it's gotten better over the last 90 days specifically with the GSC programs. The one exception to that is FHA. FHA I would tell you is unchanged. We are seeing more competition come into the FHA world from the non-banks. And that's helping a little bit, but in terms of credit availability on the FHA side it's unchanged.","I think the False Claims Act, the prosecution if you will under the False Claims Act needs to be dealt with and until that happens I think that the bigger banks are going to continue to be hesitant in underwriting to the full availability of the credit box. So that's my broader comment on credit availability.","We look at it clearly from the side of the mortgage company which we have an amazing mortgage company that Deb still runs for us and her and her team they're doing a very nice job. She helps keep Bob and I fully informed and what's going on in the mortgage world. When you look at it from the builder side of the business, I wouldn\u2019t say that mortgage availability or credit availability is impacting our ability to stop homes.","That being said, we are seeing a little bit of resistance at the higher price points because of affordability and I think that's a broader concern that affects the entire business. There's a little bit more price opportunity at the lower price points, but that's also the buyer group that's going to run into a ceiling the quickest in that they have absolute kind of maximums in terms of what they can spend.","So there are you know there are a few markets around the country that have been running hot and the premium between resale and new has grown larger than maybe what historical trends have been and those are places that I think from an affordability standpoint we all need to pay attention to. So hopefully that helps provide a little bit of color to what you're asking Ivy?","Ivy Zelman","It does thank you. Let me ask one other cost question, what's your appetite around M&A given that we've seen some acquisitions and maybe strategic opportunities to get into either new markets or maybe bolt-on and existing markets, are you in the market looking and do you see attractive opportunities?","Ryan Marshall","Yes, really no change in our appetite for M&A. I'd point you back to our capital allocation philosophy which we defined and we continue to reiterate. We want to invest in our business in new land acquisition and we've put M&A in that category sort of the extent that there's an attractive opportunity from a land pipeline standpoint and we think we give some added benefits from that acquisition we're certainly open to it.","The challenges with M&A is as you well know are the integration challenges, but if the land opportunity makes enough sense I think you'll figure out how to how to make that integration happen, so no change in our appetite. We look at a lot of deals, but really no different than organic land acquisition. We want to make sure that it makes sense.","Operator","And we have a followup question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kim","Thanks guys. Yes, sorry I got cut off there. No, no, sweat. Yes so I'm just going to move on to another question because it sounds like the total answer my question was in kind of the way you are thinking about things. But when we talk about the options which you do have, last I looked and again correct me if I'm wrong, it looked like you're putting down about 9% of the purchase price on your options. That's a number that I have here from your K and I didn't know whether or not that was the way you looked at it as well.","And could you could just give us some context for what you generally put down on your options and if there's a cap on the amount that you're willing to commit to an option before you actually take it on your books? Thanks.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, I've not looked at it in the aggregate the way you just suggested, but the 9% certainly kind of fits within if you look at deal-by-deal. We're typically going to be between 5% and 10%. There are always unique circumstances, so we might go as high as 15% in some cases, but I don't think you'd see us north of that.","Operator","Well take our next question from Bob Wetenhall with RBC capital markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey good quarter and nice job navigating the hurricane disruption. You guys did great on SG&A this quarter. There's a lot of cost control, how much runway is there on the cost side and incremental SG&A leverages we're thinking about next year?","Ryan Marshall","Hey Bob, good morning. This is Ryan. Thanks for the comment on SG&A. It's certainly been a focus. I think we've done a nice job getting it tightened up. It would execute against the business plans that we put in place for the year. As far as continued improvement on that we're always going to be looking to improve the efficiency, but any substantial gains in the future will really come with growth of the business. So that's where I would look to it.","We have done a nice job against the guide that we provided for 2017 and we're certainly kind of proud of that. We'll look to give kind of future guidance for 2018 in our fourth quarter. Keep in mind we did make the accounting change with commissions at the beginning of the year. So, our commissions are fully rolled into our SG&A spend at this point in time. So, I think you pull that out and you look at it in historical terms how we have typically have reported it. The gains are pretty substantial that we've made on the SG&A front.","Robert Wetenhall","Yes, well done it's a lot of progress there. I hope it continues. I wanted to ask you as well about order growth in the West Region which was up over 30% and what's driving demand and as you're thinking about 2018 what are your favorite markets, where do you see the most strength happening on a regional basis? Thanks and good luck. Nice execution.","Ryan Marshall","Thanks Bob. The West has been very strong. I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks it's really been driven by California. California, right now is doing well and I think you've heard that not only from us but some of our competitors. Nevada has performed very well for us this year as has Arizona. So those are the markets that are driving the order growth for us in current quarter.","As far as markets for next year, my favorite markets are any place where there is strong job growth because I think when you look at the underlying fundamentals that will continue to fuel housing demand and housing growth is in those markets where we're seeing growing economies and added jobs, so that's where my bet would be for 2018.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead.","Jack Micenko","Hi, good morning. Looking at the balance sheet into 2018 lands coming down you're running the three-three strategy. Conceptually how do you think or how would you force rank once you fund the business and fund necessary land development costs, how do you force rank buybacks dividends and deleverage beyond this year?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, Jack fair question and certainly we'll give you some color on that as we release our fourth quarter we'll think about for 2018, but I think generally I go back to something Ryan said a couple of minutes ago, the capital allocation strategy that we put in place back in 2014 still drives our primary decision making, so first and foremost into the business to your point.","Next we want to be able to fund the dividend through cycle, so we look at that candidly every quarter as we announce our current dividend we think about we want to do with that. That will be influenced by the cash flow we think the business generates in 2018 and beyond. And then if we have excess capital beyond that we'll buy back stock.","I think if you think about it we've been pretty consistent with that and highlighted that we have probably pulled forward some repurchase activity over the last 18 months through the end of this year. So leverage becomes part of the dialogue. We\u2019ve highlighted that we're a little bit outside of the range that we'd like to operate in being 30% to 40%, so I think you'll see us want to get back inside that range. We've highlighted we think it happens in 2018 essentially through earnings.","And then cash flow capabilities above and beyond that will think about how quickly we can and want to grow the business. If there\u2019s availability beyond that, we look at dividends and share repurchase, so same exercises we've followed for the last four years or so.","Jack Micenko","Okay, thanks for that. And I think in your opening comments Ryan you said sales were running maybe up 15% year-over-year in the first two months and then you hit the headwind from the storms and in September you did have a pace of growth although modest but it seems like it would have been higher had the storms not occurred. So I guess the question is, are you letting the dog off the leash a little bit on sales pace or is that really more a function of mix? I'm just trying to get a sense of where we stand on the pace price debate that we're always trying to manage.","Ryan Marshall","Yes, Jack it's a great question and to your point we ran 15% up in July and August which I think speaks to the strength of the market. September was 3% up and that was, in our view anyway purely driven by the storm related impacts. From the pace price equation that's certainly something that we pay attention to in every single community and it truly is a community by community decision that we make.","Our focus is and always has been that we're looking to drive the best possible return that we can for the shareholder. In some cases that's going to be pace, in some cases that\u2019s going to be price, so I think we let the dog off the leash where it makes sense. We're looking for the best financial outcome. And I think all of our shareholders and investors should take comfort in that.","In terms of maybe just same store growth or absorption growth, we are up 15% in first time which probably doesn't come as a surprise. I think the entire industry is seeing growth with that consumer group and we are as well. We were 2% up in move-up and then we are down 10% active adult and I really put that decline on Florida because we've got such a high concentration of active adult communities there as with Houston, we've two Del Webb communities in Houston and between Houston as well as the entire state of Florida that's a big part of our active adult business and that's I think what drove that 10% down.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Stephen East","Thank you. Actually this is [indiscernible] for Stephen. Ryan, you spoke a little bit about lumber inflation, I was wondering if we could get a little bit deeper into what you're saying from a core excluding the storm impacts on material and labor this quarter? And then also if you could give us any kind of expectation on when we might see gross margins inflect on a year-over-year basis?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Well, we had given you guidance coming into the year that we felt we were 1.5% to 2% to your own labor input cost increases. We are still in that range trending higher and as Ryan talked about lumber has trended higher. You\u2019ve got the fires in Canada, you've got terrace, I mean there is a lot of things driving lumber rates up. For us that's next year business. The way we buy our lumber we've got relative constrained on what's going to impact our Q4 deliveries.","So having said that we're still in that 1.5%, 2% range for the current year. We will give you some color on what we think it means for next year when we give our fourth quarter earnings. So at this point core cost increases are kind of trending where we thought they would be. The outlier to that is really the Houston and Florida markets that Ryan walked through earlier on the call where we are seeing some specialized labor input cost increases.","Ryan Marshall","And Paul, I think the guide that we gave on margins for the back half of the year at 23.6% to 24.1% reiterates the fact that, what Bob just talked about with the 1.5% to 2% guide we are still right there, everything is trending in the direction that we thought and we've made the one-time adjustments based on some of the things that have happened or will pull us towards the lower end of that guide for the fourth quarter results.","Stephen East","And you mentioned earlier on the call that you're ROE was up 200 basis points but that over the past 12 months, do you have a goal for that metric moving into 2018?","Ryan Marshall","Well, we'd certainly like it to continue to move higher. We haven't articulated a goal and that\u2019s something that we'll consider as the full sort of guidance that we provide for 2018.","Stephen East","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks, good morning guys.","Ryan Marshall","Hey Carl.","Carl Reichardt","How are you? I wanted to ask about the land spend so far this year. I think $775 million is what you mentioned? Has there been a change in terms of new land? If you look at your current product mix, is your new land spends sort of matching that product mix split between first-time, move-up and active adult or is it changing?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","I think what you would see is its changing. We've moved a larger percentage and it's not tectonic, there's a shift towards the first-time space with a little bit less emphasis on move-up.","Ryan Marshall","And Carl, that really reflects some of the commentary that I think you've heard from me consistently over the last year since I've been in the chair where we wanted to be more reflective of what the market opportunity is and I think you're seen that start to happen. So to Bob's point, not a tectonic shift, but definitely a shift where we started to see increased investment in that first-time space. It will take time to move the entire portfolio given the size of it, but we're happy with the direction that our field operators are taking and assessing the market opportunity and putting capital to work against all buyer groups.","Carl Reichardt","Okay, thanks. And then we've talked about labor and material price increases. Can you talk a little bit about the land inflation that you're seeing and maybe break it out by market? Is it shrinks as a percentage of the overall cost base which we have not seen very often I guess, I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing? Thanks.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, that's a hard one. I mean, I think the market is efficient and you've got everybody interested. So we are finding deals, but we are finding them also harder to underwrite quite candidly. They are - the market is pretty positive at the moment. Certainly and if you think about what Ryan said about which markets is he most interested in, I think everybody would answer that pretty much the same way and so the land in those markets gets bid up a little bit more.","Having said that, we're still finding your return characteristics on the land we are buying having changed dramatically. So the market is pretty solid. I don't know that I want to say market A is up 1% versus another market. Each piece of land is different.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please go ahead.","Alex Barron","Thanks guys and nice job on the quarter. Just kind of wanted to see if you have any guidance on what the tax rate might look like for next quarter?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","For next Q4 we've guided to 36.5% being our normalized rate. We were below that in this quarter. Its two things; one is there was a state law change that actually allowed us - but we booked a benefit because our deferred tax assets became a little more valuable because of the state tax rate increase.","We also highlighted earlier in the year that there was a change in the accounting rules that benefits running through from stock option and stock transactions for employees which used to run through the equity section now go through the income statement. That actually drove our rate down, but ex- those two things 36.5% we think is still a good rate for Q4.","Alex Barron","And as far as the increase in the price of the orders this quarter, I think you noted Northern California is one of the regions that drove that, but was there any other, was that also driven by some mix changes or was that just a general improvement in the overall markets?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Alex, certainly mix matters a lot when you're looking at that, but you know the big driver was Northern California where the price points tend to run significantly higher than any of the other regions that we operate in. And our business there is more and more concentrated in the Bay Area which starting prices there start with 6s and 7s as opposed to 2s and 3s.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. One followup was on the lumber and maybe wood products more generally. If you said what the raw materials themselves are as a percentage of your total sales, so not including the labor and the installation affiliated with it, but roughly how much is lumber as a percentage of revenues if just looking at the lumber? And then maybe more broadly if you threw in structural panels and other wood products what would that represent as a percentage of sales?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Mark. The range I would give you 7% to 10% of total revenue is what the lumber would represent. In terms of the material or the house cost piece it can run in the 15% to 20% range depending on the market.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. I suspect that probably includes installation related stuff as well just to clarify?","Ryan Marshall","That's correct it does.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And I will follow back up then, but and then second, I'm trying to think through that the strategy around pricing and pricing power. Do you look at it differently when for instance you referenced in Texas and Florida labor being up what you think is going to be on a temporary basis versus if you're going into next year and then you find that some of the materials are going to be higher for the year ahead as you put it in place. Do you think about that differently is how you then go to market and I recognize at the same time you're balancing this price versus pace issue, maybe a little bit of color on the thought process?","Ryan Marshall","Yes the thought process is Mark, one of the things that we've done over the last three to four years, we've put a lot of investment into dynamic pricing tools and pricing strategy is part of our value creation efforts and our value creation toolset. And we've done a lot of work around dynamic pricing that has allowed us to realize some of the pricing gains and margin gains that we've realized over the past four to five years and we'll continue to do that.","So certainly cost is an input. We pay attention to it. We do not price to cost, we price to the market and so what you're looking for is what is the market opportunity and what's the market's ability to absorb those price increases. So it's a little bit of a given and a take where we're certainly looking to cover the input costs that are going into the project. But if the consumers are unable or unwilling to take it, that's what you've ultimately got to react to.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes the only thing I would add to that is given the length of our backlog we have pretty good visibility into our input costs on the construction side of our backlog. So we're not out a year in advance in terms of the backlog and so the way we buy our materials is to Ryan's point we sell to market but we know our cost structure is going in for that.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Susan Maklari","Thank you good morning.","Ryan Marshall","Hi Susan.","Susan Maklari","Just quickly, you know I know that it's still kind of early probably, but have you gotten any sense from your sales people in Florida that there's been any change in how potential buyers perceive living in this day or they are looking to perhaps maybe little closer its away from the coast or anything like that following the storms that could perhaps on a longer term impact them from a psychological perspective?","Ryan Marshall","Susan this is Ryan. I may be a little biased because I love the beach and I love the sunshine and I love the water and I think the majority of our buyers do as well. So I'd say that a little bit tongue in cheek. The simple answer is no, we have not seen any kind of a psychological impact in the buyers in terms of how they're thinking about Florida. In fact it may go the other way that you had what was a 100-year or maybe even a 200-year type storm event and Florida really performed well.","The flooding for the most part was under control which I think is a testament to the way that we're developing communities and the way the drainage systems are working. From a wind standpoint your structures withstood category four, sometimes category five sustained winds and performed very well. Landscaping was really the major - the landscaping and power grid those were the things that were damaged the most. So time will tell, hard to predict what buyer psyche will do, but we are still bullish on Florida and I think the buyers will be as well.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then just building on that quickly, do you think that given the success that Florida saw and its construction codes and the drainage and all those things that you mentioned that there could be other areas of the country that use that as sort of a basis and start to adapt some of that, especially because with weather patterns changing it seems like drainage systems are becoming a bigger issue in lots of different parts of the U.S.?","Ryan Marshall","Yes Susan, I hope that common sense prevails. The things in Florida while warranted are expensive and the construction codes and the methodologies that we use there are more expensive than other parts of the country. So I think you want all good things in measure. I don't know that you want to necessarily overreact and overbuild where it is not required. You know as far as drainage and water retention and some of those things, I'd point to Houston and it wasn't just our communities.","I think you probably heard from all of our entire industry the newer communities performed quite well when it came to managing and dealing with the water on the construction sites especially in the newer development areas. So I'd like to believe that things are performing about as expected and as we continue to cycle out some of the older housing stock and bring things up to current code and current drainage standards I think things are performing pretty well.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to you, Jim Zeumer.","James Zeumer","Great. Thank you everybody for your time this morning. We will certainly be available throughout the day if you have any followup questions; otherwise we will look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2015 PulteGroup Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","Jim Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Sean and good morning to everyone participating in the conference call to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s fourth quarter financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President, and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today\u2019s discussion are posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today\u2019s call to the site later today.","Let me remind all the participants that today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup\u2019s future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by any comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","With that said, now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard Dugas","Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m extremely pleased to \u2013 with PulteGroup\u2019s fourth quarter earnings which show significantly improved results across key business metrics. In addition to ending 2015 with very strong results, our fourth quarter operating and financial performance provide a foundation we can build on in 2016. As we capitalize on opportunities to accelerate the growth of our homebuilding business.","Bob, will go through a detailed review of our Q4 financials in a moment. But there are a couple of numbers and points that I\u2019d like to highlight. Order rates in the fourth quarter were up 13%, which is the biggest year-over-year percentage jump we have realized since 2012.","As solid as this number is, what I view even more encouraging is the 9% gain in absorption pace that we realized in the quarter. We\u2019ve always said the generating higher sales within our existing footprint is the most efficient way for us to grow volumes and ultimately earnings.","Pulte\u2019s disciplined approach to acquiring the right land positions over the past several years is having a positive impact on our results. Along with order rates, the average sales price we\u2019re able to realize for our homes continue to increase. In the fourth quarter closing ASPs were up 6% to $353,000, while backlog ASP is gained 10% to $365,000.","Between market opportunities, mix shifts and ongoing implementation of our strategic pricing programs, we expect ASPs will continue to move higher in 2016 versus comparable quarters in 2015. Our recently closed purchase of assets from John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods will further our pricing gains given their higher price points.","I also want to highlight our gross margins, which at 23.5% is up 40 basis points over last year and remains arguably among the highest in the industry. As we have discussed for the past several years, we have implemented a number of programs from product and purchasing zones and commonly managed plans to \u2013 should costing and strategic pricing.","As an example, almost 60% of our fourth quarter closings were from commonly managed plans that have the benefit of increased consumer feedback and more efficient floor plan design. The goal of all this work has been to improve sales paces and gross margins in support of delivering higher returns on invested capital. A lot of time and effort has been invested in implementing these initiatives and the gains are evident in our results.","Given that the financial improvements we realized in the quarter were so broad based, I can highlight a number of other metrics in my comments. I purposely picked order rates, ASPs and gross margin because there is at least one common element which I believe is an important factor in all three metrics. That common element is land.","In 2011, we launched the value creation strategy, with its focus on delivering higher returns on invested capital over the housing cycle. By 2013, we had raised returns to the point where they exceeded our cost of capital. Since that time, we have purposely increased investment into the business, because it makes economic sense to do so. While we have raised investment, we have done so while adhering to the guidelines and disciplines we put in place back in 2011.","These disciplines include underwriting projects to a defined 13 point risk rating scorecard that helps ensure we select the highest returning projects, focusing in on land positions that are closer into job centers and located in the better markets and sub-markets, prudently using options which now account for 31% of all lots and 34% of our more traditional Pulte and Centex land positions to help enhance returns and\/or mitigate land risk.","Even though, we are having to develop over 70% of the lots we use, we have systematically expanded the percentage of option lots we maintain. We continue to emphasize investing in shorter, faster turning projects with an average investment cycle of 36 to 48 months from acquisition to completion.","By focusing in on shorter duration projects, we help to minimize risk should a housing downturn emerge sooner than expected. As an example, we expect to recruit the capital we invested in the John Wieland assets in less than four years. And we expect the purchase to be accretive to company returns by year two.","By strategically investing in land over the past few years, we have assembled a robust land pipeline that should allow PulteGroup to grow at a rate consistent with or ideally ahead of the overall housing market. Our just completed Wieland transaction will certainly support this effort.","The John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods brand is highly regarded in the Southeast particularly within the luxury buyer category. Beyond the opportunities we see to expand this position, we also see the potential to deploy our Pulte brand on to certain Wieland land positions as we work to increase volumes and accelerate future absorption of the acquired lots, again enhancing returns.","By focusing as intently on the quality, not just the quantity of the land assets we acquire. We put ourselves in the best position to maximize sales pace, pricing, margins and most importantly returns on invested capital while working to mitigate excess market risk.","Through our value creation strategy, we have now put the company in a position to grow. While continuing to generate better financial performance and consistently returning funds to our shareholders. And we have done all this while taking a more conservative lower risk approach to our business. Growth, stronger returns and properly managed risk. We think this is a great combination.","Now let me turn over the call to Bob, for a more thorough review of the quarter. Bob?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Thanks, Richard and good morning. The gains demonstrated in PulteGroup\u2019s Q4 financial results are direct reflection of the meaningful improvements we\u2019ve continued to realize in our homebuilding operations.","As I will detail, these gains can be seen throughout our fourth quarter financial savings. Fourth quarter homebuilding revenues totaled $2 billion, which is up 12% from prior year revenues of $1.8 billion. The increase in Q4 revenue is driven by a 7% increase in closings to 5,662 homes, combined with a 6% increase in average sales price $353,000. Although not a metric, we managed against, the 5,662 homes closed in the fourth quarter, equates to a backlog conversion rate of 65%. As we addressed in our most recent calls, we are working to close the year-over-year performance gap we\u2019ve experienced with regard to getting homes delivered.","We are pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter. Having said that, the challenges we and the industry face with regard to labor resources and extended land development timelines are not likely to improve in the near-term. We believe however, there are decision to prudently increase spec production, should help us to maintain a more consistent build cadence going forward.","In the quarter, closings by brands were as follows: 19% of homes were from Centex communities. 55% were from Pulte communities and 26% were from Del Webb. In the fourth quarter of last year closing from Centex, Pulte and Del Webb were 24%, 46% and 30% respectively.","Given the profile of projects we are investing in, coupled with the projected impact of assets acquired in the Wieland transaction, we believe that describing our customers by buyer group, rather than by brand will better represent the makeup of our business. As a result beginning in Q1, we will address buyer groups rather than brands.","In the fourth quarter, closings by buyer group were as follows: 31% were first time buyers, 40% were move-up buyers and 29% were active adult buyers. In 2014, closings by buyer group were 34% first time, 33% move-up and 33% active adult.","The company reported gross margins of 23.5% in the fourth quarter, which is up 40 basis points over the prior year. As it\u2019s been an ongoing trend, fourth quarter margins were enhanced by higher option and lot premium revenues. In fact, option revenues in the quarter increased 10% or $4,976 per closing, while lot premiums gained 16% or $1,868 per closing.","Sales discounts remained modest, it just 2.2% or $8,026 per home, compared with 2.1% or $7,040 per home last year. This implementing our strategic pricing programs and 2011 as part of our value creation strategy, option revenues per home have increased by $19,800 or 58%, while lot premiums per home have increased by approximately $7,100 or 107%.","We believe our more strategic approach to pricing has been a key contributor to the high gross margins we continue to maintain. Reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $139 million or 7% of home sale revenues, included the benefit of a $30 million reversal of construction related insurance reserves. Reported prior year SG&A expense of $146 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues, reflected at $15 million reversal of construction related insurance reserves.","Looking at the full-year, our reported SG&A of $590 million, which was 10.2% of homebuilding revenues, includes the benefit of $62 million or 110 basis points, associated with certain legal settlements and reserve reversals.","PulteGroup\u2019s financial services segment reported fourth quarter pre-tax income of $29 million, which includes the reversal of $12 million in mortgage repurchase reserves. The decision to reduce reserves is based on probable settlement of various repurchase requests and current conditions. Mortgage capture rate in Q4 was 83%, up from 81% in the prior year. I would like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of our financial services team, including Pulte Mortgage and PGP title and meeting the challenges in the new regulatory environment under TRID. Our teams did a tremendous job closing Pulte Mortgage loans, without missing a beat and supporting our customers under the new rules.","Deb Still, our President and CEO of Financial Services and her team are recognized leaders in the industry and did a fantastic job, implementing the changes needed to operate within the new TRID guidelines. Looking at net income for the fourth quarter, we reported $228 million or $0.64 per share, which includes $0.07 per share of benefit from insurance and mortgage reserve reversals taken in the quarter. Our per share earnings were calculated using approximately 352 million shares outstanding for the quarter, which is down 6% from last year, largely as a result of our share repurchase activities.","As part of our income statement review, we wanted to provide some thoughts about 2016, given our backlog in anticipated land, labor and material costs. We expect 2016 homebuilding margins, inclusive of the diluted effect of the Wieland transaction to remain high and be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. This annual margin guidance includes a negative impact of the Wieland transaction of approximately 100 basis points, in the first quarter 80 basis points in the second quarter and 50 basis points, in each of the third and fourth quarters.","Looking at our projected SG&A, we expect our full year spend will be approximately 10% of homebuilding revenues. Consistent with prior years, this will be impacted on a quarterly basis, by the seasonality of our closings. Based on the margin and overhead guidance we just provided, the calculated operating margin we expect to generate in 2016 is between 11.5% and 12%. The operating margin we reported for 2015 was 13.2% but this was enhanced by the 110 basis points impact from the construction related insurance reserve reversals we recorded during the year.","When you consider that our 2016 operating margin guidance of 11.5% to 12% is being negatively impacted by roughly 70 basis points from the Wieland transaction and factoring the 110 basis point enhancement to 2015 operating margins. You can see that operating margins will actually flat to slightly improved in 2016 compared to 2015.","Given headwinds the industry is facing on land and labor costs, we\u2019re very proud to be able to maintain our strong operating margins. Putting all this together, the combination of expected higher closing volumes, higher ASPs and overhead leverage have us positioned for strong earnings growth in 2016.","Moving past the income statement and reviewing our homebuilding operations, we ended the fourth quarter with a total of 6,494 homes under construction. Spec units accounted for 30% of the homes under production, which is up from 26% at this time last year.","As discussed, we have purposely increased the amount of spec homes we have in the pipeline to help maintain a more even construction cadence. In the fourth quarter, we approved approximately 7,000 lots for purchase excluding the Wieland assets, as that deal close to mid-January.","We ended the year with 138,000 lots under control, of which approximately 42,000 lots or 31% were controlled via option. We continue to seek out opportunities to increase our use of land options in an effort to enhance returns and\/or lower our overall risk profile.","Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are finished and 18% are currently under development. As Richard discussed, we continue to use the defined and disciplined approach to our land investment. Consistent with our land acquisition guidelines, we invested $485 million in land acquisition in Q4, and an additional $304 million for development of previously acquired lots.","These investments brought our full year land related spend to $2.3 billion. For the year, we invested approximately $1.2 billion to acquire new land. Looking ahead to 2016, including the money invested to acquire the Wieland assets, we have authorized $1.6 billion for land acquisitions. As always, this level of investment is predicated on our continuing assessment of the market, and on our ability to identify suitable high returning projects.","Looking at our capital allocated to shareholders in the fourth quarter. We distributed $28 million in dividends and did not repurchase any of our stock. The lack of share repurchase activity was due to trading limitations resulting from work to close our previously disclosed term loans and to acquire the Wieland assets. We expect our share repurchase program to become active again beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Based on our fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with $775 million of cash and the debt to capital ratio of 30%.","As Richard noted at the start of this call, we realized strong new order growth in the fourth quarter as orders were up 13% over the last year to 3,659 homes. Higher orders for the period were driven by 9% increase in absorption paces, as all three buyer groups realized higher prices.","It should be noted that we expect absorption paces in the first half of 2016 to be lower as we integrate the Wieland communities with their typical operating model, of higher ASPs, and slower absorption paces relative to Pulte averages.","Breaking down orders by buyer group, on a year-over-year basis, our first time buyer business was flat, while move-up an active adult orders increased 35%, 3% respectively. Adjusting for community count, our absorption paces were up 16% from first time buyers, 11% from move-up buyers and 9% for active adult buyers.","On a dollars basis, orders for the fourth quarter gained 24% to $1.4 billion, helping to raise the average sales price and backlog to $365,000. It\u2019s important to remember the normal business seasonality and its impact on the mix of closings will typically result in lower delivered ASPs in the first quarter of each year.","The company operated out of 620 communities during the fourth quarter, which is up 4% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we currently expect community count growth versus comparable prior year period to be in the range of 8% to 10% in the first two quarters of the year, increasing to 10% to 15% growth in the back half of the year.","This will be our largest year-over-year increase in community count since the housing recovery began. Supported by our strong orders in the fourth quarter, we ended 2015 with a backlog of 6,731 homes, valued at $2.5 billion. The growth in our year-end backlog up 15% in units and 26% in dollars compared to last year, gives us great momentum heading into 2016.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard.","Richard Dugas","Thanks, Bob. As Bob, detailed the company realized meaningful improvement in our operating and financial results for the quarter. Given the strength of our operating metrics and the expansion of our land pipeline, we are in an excellent position to grow earnings in 2016 and beyond.","As has been our practice, let me provide a few comments on the market conditions which drove our fourth quarter results. Consistent with our Q4 increases in orders and absorption pace, we experienced generally higher buyer traffic to our communities, a pattern we realized throughout 2015.","Further, many of the trends we experienced earlier in 2015 continued through Q4, with stronger demand in the better located and on average closer end communities. Specific to the fourth quarter, buyer demand remain positive up and down the East Coast with notable strength in the Southeast from the Carolinas down to Florida. We\u2019ve talked about positive demand trends in the Southeast for a number of years. It is this trend and our expectations for long-term growth in the Southeast markets, particularly the bigger markets of Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte and Raleigh, which made the transaction with John Wieland so compelling.","Looking to the center of the country, demand conditions remain favorable, although we continue to experience volatility in the performance of underlying markets. Demand in the Midwest showed some positive gains, as we benefitted from an expanded community count in several markets.","Our Texas business in Q4 was slowed by having roughly 10% fewer open communities, available for sale versus the prior year. In addition, our Texas numbers were impacted by ongoing demand softness in the higher price communities in Houston, resulting from the prolonged weakness in the energy markets. Given current conditions, we are being very thoughtful about deploying additional capital in the region and we\u2019ll continue to carefully monitor demand throughout the state.","The Western third of the country continue to realize excellent demand from Washington through California and through our markets in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. Overall, we were pleased with our demand conditions developed in the fourth quarter. We have seen a continuation of good traffic and demand trends through the first few weeks of January.","So we have every reason to be optimistic heading into the spring selling season. Consistent with our long held expectations for a gradual but sustained recovery, 2015 new home sales of approximately 500,000 units for the country were up 15% over last year. Given the favorable market dynamics of strong job growth, accelerating household formations, supported demographic trends and continued low interest rates, we expect new home sales will continue their slow and steady path higher for the next several years.","All that being said, we are well aware of the volatility in the world today. From concerns of our global economic conditions to the swoon in oil prices, to gyrations in the stock market, the day-to-day swings can be violent. The reality is however that we can\u2019t control any of these factors, what we can do is focus on running our business, consistent with the goals we have established and disciplines we\u2019ve demonstrated. This means acquiring well-located communities that we believe can deliver high returns on investment. It also means hedging our bets by using more land options, where possible and focusing in on smaller, shorter duration projects, where we can get our capital back quickly.","It also means, not over leveraging the balance sheet and keeping one hand on the lever to slow investment if housing demand begins to change. And finally, it means having the discipline to systematically give excess funds back to shareholders, rather than trying to force investments in the system. We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter performance. I\u2019m confident that we can build on these results in 2016 and further capitalize on the excellent market position, I believe PulteGroup maintains today. Our market position has been built by our exceptional group of employees, who work hard every day to build great homes and deliver an unmatched home buying experience to our customers.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","Jim Zeumer","Great. Thank you, Richard. We\u2019ll open the call for questions. So, that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up.","Sean, if you\u2019ll explain the process, we\u2019ll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Interesting year, I just wanted to touch on \u2013 you guys have really robust order growth and you also noted 7.5% decline in deliveries in Texas and orders were also soft. Can you give us a view on what you\u2019re seeing in the Texas market and specifically, is it broad based or is it and what\u2019s going on with price points there?","Richard Dugas","Bob, this is Richard. Good morning. Overall the higher price points in Houston continue to exhibit softness as we\u2019ve discussed. Outside of Houston, I would say that we have a mix performance with some notable strength in Dallas. That seems to be the one market that continues to hold up better than the rest of the markets. So overall it\u2019s a decent housing market with the exception of the higher price points in Houston and we\u2019re being thoughtful with our investments going forward keeping an eye on things.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. As a follow-up, great execution it seems like you\u2019re on track with deliveries and surmounting some of the labor bottlenecks. Trying to understand the setup for 2016, when we\u2019re thinking about pacing and absorption and your expectations for ASP performance, you said that there is some volatility, but then you look at some of your trends and they seem very strong. How should we be thinking about pricing trends versus cost? You touched on that gross margin 21.5% to 22%. What gives the confidence on the ASP growth you can get there? Thanks and good luck.","Richard Dugas","There\u2019s a lot of stuff in that question, Bob. I think in terms of ASP growth, we don\u2019t factor that into our expectations. But we\u2019ve got \u2013 a third of the year in backlog, we\u2019ve got an expectation that we\u2019ve got relatively benign input costs this year. So lumber is trending positively, basically all the other input costs, we see about 2% increase, maybe in our house costs construction that\u2019s largely labor. We\u2019re obviously working through that in all the different markets. So we have visibility into a good part of the year, and at least in terms of input costs, we think that we\u2019re in relatively good shape coming into the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much, guys. Yes, strong quarter and impressive results.","Richard Dugas","Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kim","I wanted to ask you a little bit about your break-out of the first time move up in active adult. Just one, two clarifying questions on that. So first of all you said that, in 4Q, I think it was 31% first-time, 40% move-up and then you gave \u2013 some numbers about a third, third, third for 2014. I just want to make sure that was full year 2014 versus fourth quarter of 2014. If you could remind me again, the definition of first-time versus move-up. I mean are you actually just asking them? Is it the first time you\u2019ve ever owned a home or you just sort of \u2013 putting that sort of a demarcation based on price point or what you think a typical first-time buyer would be buying?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes, Stephen. To the first question is \u2013 that is Q4 data, not full-year. And to the second question, we actually have, what we call targeted consumer groups and so it\u2019s based on the type of product we\u2019re building and the location of it, that tells us who the buyer groups are. And so, the first time designation is just an aggregation of the targeted consumer groups that serve people that are buying, their homes first time as opposed to move up.","Stephen Kim","Yes. That\u2019s what I thought. And what\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019ve been sitting\u2026","Richard Dugas","Stephen, just to clarify, I think we had talked about this on a couple of calls. The flagging of those differs somewhat. So there are \u2013 for that millennial buyer that\u2019s closer in typically higher price point, we flagged them Pulte, but they are really first-time buyers. So that\u2019s the primary difference there and then there are certain active adult penetrations that we have historically and will continue to flag Pulte not Del Webb that will get caught in the active adult categorization as opposed to, again being a Pulte flagged.","Stephen Kim","Right. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s obviously an important distinction to make because, obviously we\u2019ve been \u2013 will not obviously, but we\u2019ve been seeing a pickup in first-time buying activity that doesn\u2019t seem to really have manifested in entry-level product per se. But \u2013 if that would be consistent with an idea that the guy who let\u2019s say, was a 26, 27-year-old, six years ago, is now older and probably in the market maybe buying a slightly different product than he would have six years ago.","I guess my question generally would be, as you lay out your community count growth, as you think about how you\u2019re going to be utilizing the Wieland land with some of your product. And just generally as you position your business in 2016 and 2017, how specifically or discreetly are you targeting a first-time buyer who may be looking to sort of buy a product which historically might have been considered a little bit more of a move-up, the first-time move-up kind of a product? Like, how much are you actually positioning yourself for the emergence of that kind of a buyer into the marketplace an increase in that demand?","Richard Dugas","Yes, Steve. This is Richard. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. As an organization, I think we\u2019ve talked about the millennial study that we completed in 2015 which showed what we believe to be significant opportunity for a buyer that is probably in their early to mid 30s who hasn\u2019t owned a home before. So they\u2019re called a first-time buyer, but they\u2019re spending $300,000 to $400,000 on urban townhome product.","So, overall our categorization that Bob described, we think more accurately depicts how we\u2019re attempting to serve the business, because those buyers will be captured in that first time category. And we are investing in several of our major cities in that buyer category, and that\u2019s part of the contributing change in ASP that you see in our backlog and in our continued guidance going forward. That\u2019s a part of the Pulte story here.","Jim Zeumer","Just to follow on that to add, Steve point, Richard, the average selling price of the first time home is about $264,000, and when you compare that to the historical pricing that we've disclosed for Centex that entry-level business that roughly $200,000, there is a definite difference in the product we are offering, the location we're offering in it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thanks and, yes, let me add strong results in the fourth quarter. So congratulations on that.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Thank you.","Richard Dugas","Thank you.","Nishu Sood","First question I wanted to ask was \u2013 the absorption trend was very nice in the fourth quarter and counter to what we\u2019ve seen generally I think from the industry. 9% absorption growth, now that was on a lower level of community count growth. You\u2019re expecting quite strong community count growth 10% to 15%, I believe you said year-over-year by the end of the year. So typically with new community openings that might dampen absorptions at first. How would that trend then carry through or how would you anticipate that strength carrying through into 2016? Is it going to be diluted by a lot of these new communities are going to be coming on or do you think there is enough momentum that you might be able to sustain that?","Richard Dugas","Nishu, this is Richard. Just a couple of comments. To be clear, our 13% sign-up growth was driven by 4% community count growth and 9% improvement in absorption rates on like stores. So we are very pleased with that and before I answer to your question, I just want to point out that we believe that underlying strength and absorption rate is primarily driven by excellent land positions, and we\u2019ve been talking for several years how we believe we\u2019re doing an excellent job of positioning our communities, not just growing for growth sake.","Having said that, with regard to our 2016, two things, number one, we\u2019re going to have nice community count growth this year, but it will be a little less in Q1 and Q2 as Bob indicated and then more in Q3 and Q4, although strong, really all four quarters. So that factor, we would expect absorption rates in Q1 to be impacted there. But probably more notably, as we work to integrate the Wieland business, that business is typically a higher price point, slower absorption model, and that as we integrate, it will impact our results, particularly earlier in the year. So just try to make sure that everyone\u2019s expectations factor that into their overall model. So we\u2019re very pleased with the way the trends are playing out for 2016, particularly as it relates to earnings growth overall, but those factors will play in.","Nishu Sood","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then second question, on the margin outlook which Bob, I think you laid out pretty well. The capitalized interest that is flowing through the gross margin line, has been an important tailwind for the overall gross margins, that\u2019s certainly the case in 4Q as well as for overall 2015. How do you expect that to trend in 2016? Should we take the percentage of revenues that are represented in 4Q and maybe carry that forward? Could you give us some \u2013 your thoughts on that?","Richard Dugas","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And essentially if you think about it, we\u2019ve got a lag between when we incur cost and expense it. And we\u2019ve had the benefit over the last few years of the debt paydown. That obviously is mitigated in most recent year, if you look at our current full year 2015 our cash interest expense was about $128 million, the expense that we\u2019ve recognize through the income statement was $138 million. So they\u2019re getting closer together. So there will be a much smaller Delta, I think in absolute terms we were $57 million benefit for interest in 2015. That number will be smaller in 2016. And again reflective of the fact that basically where costing off what we\u2019re expensing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Richard Dugas","Good morning, Mike.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Rehaut","First question I wanted to delve in a little bit around the gross margins as well. And appreciate the insights there, and I think if I understand you correctly Bob, you\u2019re saying that the amortized interest for 2016 will trend closer to that $128 million, is that fair?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Yes, we haven\u2019t given any detail. But it\u2019s going to be a much smaller delta than it has been.","Michael Rehaut","Right, right. So you\u2019re just trying to get into the components then, of the pre-interest gross margin. And get some of your sense of the puts and takes there 4Q 2015 down about 100 or 90 basis points year-over-year. What were the key drivers of that, and it was also down sequentially I just wanted to get your sense if, labor was a big part, if there was a mix shift, if there was land cost, what were the kind of drivers. And also as we think about 2016, I know you highlighted the Wieland acquisition being about a 70 basis point drag, but what would the other components of that \u2013 of the year-over-year change be?","Richard Dugas","Yes, Mike, I think you summarized it well. There is about 70 basis points of detriment that we expect in 2016 from the Wieland acquisition. And then if you look at it, the margin profiles business thinking about it from consumer groups is, as has been the case for years, the most, the highest margin is going to be our active adult. Interestingly when you look at it, the first time business actually enjoys very high margins for two reasons. One, that millennial business that we talked about is a very strong margin business for us. And for the historical Centex business, since we haven\u2019t been investing many of the lots that were running through now are older so they enjoyed strong margins. And then that move up business which is where we\u2019ve done most of our investment over the last three or four years, still enjoying very good margins, but because of the higher land cost and labor costs that we are seeing, is today of the three, although still strong, the lower margin business. And so the mix shift towards that has implications to our composite margin. So 70 basis points from Wieland, mix shift and labor cost, probably the biggest driver of margin otherwise in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. First question I had is, you gave a lot of detail on the purchase accounting effect from the Wieland acquisition on gross margin. Just curious about how you are expecting kind of SG&A to trend through 2016 given some of the integration costs and then moving past that, once it\u2019s fully integrated, is the $165 million kind of quarterly run rate still a good number or do you think that will actually go up a bit?","Richard Dugas","We actually are \u2013 instead of targeting dollars, we are putting trying to get things more aligned with industry and say, okay relative to sales this is what we think. So we think 10%. Obviously the seasonality of the business with lower closings in the first half of the year, higher closings you can and should expect to see be a richer number being higher than 10% in the first couple of quarters and lower much like we did in the fourth quarter of this year. You know, certainly there will be some integration cost associated with Wieland that we would expect overtime to be able to narrow out of the business. But the 10% that we had projected for 2016 is inclusive of that.","Richard Dugas","John. This is Richard. And little color also. The 10% guidance Bob provided, when you factor in the construction reversal impact in the 2015 number, you can see that we\u2019re getting substantial leverage in 2016 as we expect to grow.","John Lovallo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of, maybe can you just give us an update on kind of your spec strategy and how that progressed in the quarter. I think you ended the third quarter with something like 340 finish spec homes and we did you close of the year?","Richard Dugas","So finished spec at the end of the year was 471 units which is actually down about 2% from prior year. We started that spec really in the third quarter, so they weren\u2019t finished at the end of year. So you\u2019ll see that come through in our first quarter and second quarter results. But totals spec we talked about, at about 30% of our starts compared to 24% historically. So it\u2019s not a big change, and I think what you can and should expect to do is manage against not letting finished specs get really heavy.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","And John and everyone else, just to remind everyone, the reason that we\u2019re increasing our spec production a little bit is to help us with the quarterly cadence of closing, not trying to run quite as tight as we were with pre-sold inventory, and we think that\u2019s going to help us moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner","Hi, guys. Good morning and nice quarter. Congrats.","Richard Dugas","Thanks, Alan.","Alan Ratner","Richard, just on your comment on January, it seems like it\u2019s holding up pretty well. Curious if you\u2019re \u2013 what you\u2019re hearing underground from your active adult buyers given all the stock market volatility? Has there been any \u2013 have you noticed any discernible trends there versus more of the first time or maybe first time move-up product. Because it is a very discretionary buyer I imagine, they\u2019re looking at 401(k) portfolios, as they might be a little bit skittish. So just curious what you\u2019re seeing from that subset of buyers currently?","Richard Dugas","Alan, it\u2019s a great question we\u2019ve been paying attention and so far we\u2019ve not seen a change.","Alan Ratner","Great, that\u2019s good to hear. Second, on the spec strategy, is there any contemplation within the gross margin guidance next year for specs to represent a greater percentage of your sales? Assuming that is the case, what\u2019s the margin differential are running at currently between your spec and to be built sales?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Certainly, Alan, we factored that into our guidance. As we put together our plans for the year, people knew what they were going to try and start in terms of spec. In terms of actual performance, I would tell you that, recent activity we would tell you that there is a very consistent with historical trend where you are, your dirt sales have the higher margins, we\u2019ve actually seen that people are contracting before framing that the margins hold up and stay consistent, and then we have a couple of 100 basis points of degradation on spec that is finished. So again, I think one of the things we\u2019re really focused on is, let\u2019s not get that finished spec to be a big drag on our margins going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning.","Richard Dugas","Good morning.","Megan McGrath","I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the absorption pace. The nice improvement you had in the quarter, in your commentary you stated that you feel like that driver is primarily because of \u2013 the location of your communities. But I assume that location didn\u2019t change too much quarter-to-quarter. So was there anything specific in the fourth quarter that you think drove that sort of incremental increase? It doesn\u2019t feel like overall new home sales accelerated, in fact, maybe decelerated a little bit. So what specific do you guys changed, let\u2019s say third quarter and fourth quarter, which help that absorption pace in your view?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Megan, there is volatility typically quarter-to-quarter. But I would point out, this is a third or fourth quarter out of the last maybe four or five that we had improved absorption paces. So I believe that\u2019s a factor. I would also say that as our commonly managed floor plans continue to grow as a component of our total, those are very well designed and frankly sell better than the non-commonly managed floor plans, so that\u2019s a factor. But I would continue to highlight that well place land, we\u2019re focused on quality of land, not just quantity of land is the primary driver in my opinion. These will \u2013 maybe what some others in the industry have talked about.","Megan McGrath","Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to follow-up on SG&A a little bit too as well. I apologize if I missed part of your answer before. But I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here and some of the numbers. So it looks like you\u2019re looking for, if we ex-out the benefits this year, a pretty meaningful year-over-year improvement in SG&A, it looks like about 100 plus basis points. If I have that right. But also looking for a pretty good increase in gross and community count, which I would usually associate with maybe some accelerating SG&A levels. So if you could maybe talk us through your confidence and being able to sort of growth SG&A the slower rate even though you are accelerating your community count growth that would be great, thanks.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Well, it\u2019s interesting, Megan, a big driver of the community count growth is Wieland. And so we opened 200 communities this year and will open some number similar to that next year. So there really isn\u2019t a significant driver there. It\u2019s in terms of community count growth a lot of it is going to be Wieland that we get one big chunk.","Richard Dugas","And Megan I think you highlighted \u2013 this is Richard, I think you highlighted it inappropriately. We are anticipating growth in earnings and certainly in volume this year and that provides leverage overall. So we\u2019re not giving any SG&A dollar number but we do expect to leverage our overheads and you are right with your guidance or your commentary if you will on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Why don\u2019t you go back to the margin discussion and I think you addressed it with both Mike Rehaut\u2019s question and Alan, but in terms of some of the mix shift, you\u2019ve got two things going on. You\u2019ve got selling through some of the legacy Centex stuff that was higher margin and transitioning both to move up product and the recent vintage, so just wanted to get your sense of this margin erosion that you\u2019re seeing in 2016. Do you think you are fully run rating what the kind of go-forward mix will be or is there still some to kind of transition out this is still being lifted a little bit by 20% or so of the communities that are still legacy Centex? Any additional detail you could give there?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Well, honestly, we will as the year goes on share what the breakdown is by consumer group. I don\u2019t know that we would want to give quarterly forward guidance that would be community specific Mike. So I think there certainly continues to be a mix shift we\u2019ve invested largely in that move up category. So you will see that continue to play out.","Richard Dugas","And Mike this is Richard. I think it\u2019s worth noting that we are extremely pleased with our margin projection for 2016. When you factor in the known headwinds from a new acquisition. We are pretty pleased with how margins are holding up when you combine that with what we expect to be good SG&A leverage and strong growth. Our operating margins we continue to be very pleased with. So yes there are certainly some anticipated core declines from higher input cost that Bob mentioned, but our relative basis we like our margin position a lot.","Mike Dahl","Right, I mean, clearly coming from a point of strength. I guess then Richard on that last point on the acquisition, once we get through the \u2013 I mean this is for Bob, once we get to the purchase accounting headwinds which I believe you said 70 basis points drag for, the full year, how should we think about that margin relative to what your legacy business has been producing? I think that was understanding was that may have been a competitive deal so as this once we get through the purchase accounting of 20% margin business or is it really closer to what we\u2019ve seen out of your legacy business the past year or so?","Richard Dugas","Yes, Mike, we haven\u2019t given anything beyond 2016. I would tell you, we see opportunities to reduce costs and enhance cases to drive higher returns and that's what we're going to work towards. When we get to 2017, we\u2019ll share what our total margins are and to the extent that, it's relevant we\u2019ll share what the impact of Wieland this season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Richard, maybe, the first one. With John Wieland, could you talk a little bit about what drove your decision process here? I know you all are always looking at acquisition this land buys, but more extensively, what was the attraction and how specific was it to John Wieland versus, are you all still actively engaged in looking for more acquisition opportunities that type of thing?","Richard Dugas","Steve it\u2019s a great question. Let me first confirm your comment that all acquisitions are looked at through the lands and we\u2019re pleased with the economics of the deal overall and as Bob mentioned the ability to put some Pulte efficiency if you will and to what we saw there. And a part of that, you might have noted in our script, we\u2019re intending to take some Wieland assets and put Pulte product on it to help accelerate absorptions and drive returns.","So we feel really great about that. Beyond that, this particular transaction had significant brand value in our mind. For buyers in the Southeast, the John Wieland named commands a premium. And when you factor that into the strategic pricing programs, the focus on option revenue and lot premium revenue, it's a really nice fit into the way we've been driving margins in the business. And we feel like it's a real consistent approach toward driving high returns.","So the brand value there is exciting, and candidly, even the value of the Wieland name from an entitlement standpoint, we feel very good about going forward. We want to grow our business in the Southeast, and the Wieland reputation is excited and allowing us to get into some of these core infill locations, millennial locations. So a very, very strong recognized consumer brand in the Southeast that gives us opportunity along with the strong land positions. And then potentially, lastly, I\u2019ll mention the Southeast, Steve, we like vis-a-vis some other markets, we think the Southeast is not overheated. We think the Southeast has got a lot of runway in front of it. And complimentary assets that are not cannibalizing anything else we felt good about. And then just on your last point, we continue to stay actively looking at any transaction come that our way. We\u2019ve been very, very disciplined to make sure the economics work.","Stephen East","Okay. Thank you. And then Bob did I hear you right, did you say land spend in 2016 would be $1.6 billion or were you just talking about acquisition side of it? Can you give me a little clarity there? And where you would be, are you reallocating more toward this first time buyer I know not active adult but first time buyer away from the move-up buyer? And just maybe a bit broader on your net debt targets comfortable where your debt is now or do you want to take it lower versus repo that type of thing?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes, so to your first question that $1.6 billion that we highlighted was just land acquisition. We will obviously have development spend on top of that. In terms of where we are spending that money, we are still agnostic. Over time we\u2019ve told folks go find the best deals, what that has yielded over the last few years is mostly move-up and that millennial core business that we\u2019ve talked about. I don\u2019t see anything at the moment that tells me it\u2019s going to be anything different in the future, but certainly as and when for instance if that true entry level buyer becomes more robust in terms of paces and the returns make sense we\u2019ve always talked about a willingness and desire to do that.","And then to your last point on net debt, 30% to 30.5% at the end of the year. We are very comfortable with that. We have laid out a target range of 30% to 40%. So, yes, very comfortable with our balance sheet position and liquidity. So we\u2019ve got plenty of choice candidly we\u2019ve increased the dividend starting here in the first quarter. We didn\u2019t get to do any share repurchases during the quarter, but you can expect to see us do some of that going forward, and obviously we think we can do that all in the context of the land spend that we outlined.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Will Randow","Hey, good morning guys and congrats on the progress.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thanks, Will","Richard Dugas","Thanks Will.","Will Randow","I just had a question on the mortgage business in regards to how are you thinking about normalizing underwriting standards if possible what levers can pull, and if you could talk about the difficulties and implementing to know before you owe, in terms of more mortgage closings are elongated et cetera.","Richard Dugas","So I\u2019ll take the first one, Will, in terms of overall underwriting standards, if they remain fairly consistent. They continue to be tight, and we are governed by the same rules that everyone else is. So no real change in outlook there, may be on the margin it continues to ease just very, very slightly, but overall not much change and then Bob maybe on the TRID rules?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","And with respect to all the rules, again I think we\u2019ve got the best team in the business. They think about change long in advance sort of problematically, systematically. So I don\u2019t see it being an impediment and I know they\u2019ll say, gosh, a lot of hard work behind that, but they\u2019ve got a very clear calendar of the things that are coming at us. Think about strategically so again, I don\u2019t want to make it sound easy, but the TRID, that affected this fourth quarter, it really did not impact our closings and that\u2019s testaments of the work they do that from\u2026","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Hi, Susan.","Richard Dugas","Hi, Susan.","Susan Maklari","In terms of the labor side, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there? It seems like with the progress you made in closing homes and the talk around your spec strategy, are you seeing any incremental using there? Perhaps some of the contractors are gaining a bit more confidence and what\u2019s going on in the market?","Richard Dugas","Susan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a real easing. I think we\u2019re getting a little bit better at managing through it by not being quite as tight with our spec inventory change if you will. We give ourselves a few more targets to shoot at each quarter to account for any up and downs that may occur in the market. But labor continues to be tight. There\u2019s not a lot of new labor that\u2019s flowing into the space. So I do think the industry and that\u2019s particularly we are getting a little better at managing through it. But it\u2019s going to be with us for a while.","Susan Maklari","Okay.","Bob O'Shaughnessy","But the ability to give that to labor markets, the cadence and a consistent view that says \u2013 we\u2019ve got the following work, we\u2019re going to keep our crews busy, we\u2019re not pulled off \u2013 on off the sites. We think we\u2019ll have real benefit in terms of our ability to produce timely.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then, as we look to your, obviously the improvements in the option revenues that we\u2019ve seen and we think 2016, the continuation of the value creation efforts there. Can we see that continue to come up or how should we think about the trends with this?","Richard Dugas","Susan, this is Richard. I would never say we\u2019re done in that regard. We certainly taken a lot of price in the last few years, and I would say, the low hanging fruits have been picked overall, but that\u2019s a big focus for us as an organization. And every new job, we open we tend to push, it\u2019s actually been extremely pleasing to us that we\u2019ve been able to continue to make progress quarter-over-quarter there. So, no specific guidance there, clearly there is headwinds from higher cost land and labor pressure as Bob talked about influencing but that helps us to mitigate it. I can\u2019t really give you much more detail though in terms of what we expect there. We\u2019ll have to see how the quarters play out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Jay McCanless","Good morning. First question, what was the can rate in the quarter and what was last year?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Can rate was 18.1 that's about 100 basis points over the last year.","Jay McCanless","Okay, and then the second question I had is just with Richard\u2019s commentary earlier about maybe shifting some of the Wieland land to the Pulte nameplate, we had expected an ASP growth of roughly high single-digits for this year as you guys were Wieland in, is that what you\u2019re expecting internally or should we be a little more muted and what you expect for average price growth, if you are going to shift some of that land to lower price Pulte product?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","Jay, we\u2019re not given specific guidance on ASP, overall you can kind of see what\u2019s happening in our backlog and project out the next quarter or two in terms of what\u2019s happening with overall ASP. I would point out that Wieland in total will make a modest percentage of the company\u2019s total. So when you factor a portion of that, only a portion of that being Pulte, that specific impact is probably not significant on our overall ASPs. And later in the year can [indiscernible] by the time you actually launch the new product, get the community open, start building houses, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko","Hey, good morning. I\u2019m curious about how to think about your lands strategy, obviously the option components correct up to about a third of the inventory now. But then I think in the prepared comments you had said, around 70% of the land spend was for undeveloped. Can we think is that the option percentage is going to continue to creep up or is this a signal that maybe to maintain those margins going to be go out give more on the development side.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes Jack what we really are trying to say is we are really paying attention to managing the risk side of the land component. The fact that we\u2019re having to develop 70% plus is just a factor of the way the land comes to us in the market, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t break those takes into two or three or four takes with options to mitigate risk. And we want to highlight that on Wieland candidly because some of the reports I saw showed people talking about buying eight years, or ten years or 12 years worth of land and we expect to recoup all of our capital in less than four years on that deal. So we\u2019re very, very focused on mitigating risk from that perspective.","So in terms of option percentage, I would hope that we can continue to drive that forward the market will take that but agnostic to options or development or not the key is we\u2019re managing risk very differently than we did in the past. Buying 10 or 12 years worth of land at one time is very, very rare event today for the company and will continue to be going forward.","Jack Micenko","Okay, so consistent strategy of sort of more efficient balance sheet around the land piece.","Richard Dugas","I think that\u2019s right.","Jack Micenko","Okay.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Yes and just to clear, it\u2019s really not a margin management exercise, to Richard\u2019s point it\u2019s what comes to us in the market and we underwrite transactions against returns not against margins. So they may drive higher margins, at some point in time, but we are really focused on what the characteristics of the return obviously we have to hold the land for too long that doesn\u2019t seems much good.","Jack Micenko","Okay. And then, adding on to the Alan\u2019s earlier question about the marketplace I mean the risk between what, I guess, the equity markets are pricing and around the domestic picture and what companies across many industries are now spring selling season, I mean, and you had some bullish commentary on January. I mean does anything absent Houston is there anything you are seeing a broad footprint that would suggest that there's any kind of creep in [indiscernible] from what\u2019s happening in the broader markets to traffic or demand based?","Richard Dugas","Jack, we are watching it very carefully, candidly we haven\u2019t seen the impact yet. And it is interesting to kind of understand that, but I would say it\u2019s really too early for 2016. Now spring selling season kicks off, typically Super Bowl will get a good read on it. But look we can only say we like what we see so far. So we are optimistic, you factor in the combination of low supply in the space in general still five months supply plus or minus, low rates, a jobs picture that I would say is good not great, yes, there is some macro volatility, but so far we like what we are seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you, first could you let us know how many active communities are at Wieland?","Richard Dugas","Approximately 40.","Mark Weintraub","40, great. And then I think the original expectation was going to be earnings and cash flow accretive in year right from the back. I think today you indicated by next year, is that \u2013 can you just clarify that first?","Richard Dugas","Yes, we still believe its earnings and cash flow accretive the year one. It is return accretive year two. That was the comment that we made today. So, yes, we\u2019ve laid out significant cash position and we\u2019ve talked about. We need to start up some of these activities that we think drive higher paces and margin and it will take us some time. So we think it becomes accretive in year two.","Mark Weintraub","Great. Then lastly, can you bracket expected land development spend for 2016?","Bob O'Shaughnessy","I think you have seen from us over the last two years that it is roughly 50\/50. And that is probably not out of the range of reasonable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gilbert from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ryan Gilbert","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions, most of them have been answered. But just really quickly on the backlog conversion year-over-year improving the gap, in the year-over-year decline. Can you talk, I guess, specifically about the processes or specific steps that you took in the quarter to generate that improvement? And then how you expect that to trend in 2016? I think, just given that, it seems like your growth rate is going to accelerate. Interested in hearing how you think that you can continue to close the gap? Thanks.","Richard Dugas","Yes Bob go ahead with that.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","I\u2019m sorry, just the first and the only comment I wanted to make to that is our spec strategy is going to help there. We shifted starting in late Q3 into Q4 building a few more homes on spec, in order to give us an opportunity sort of mitigate some of that decline. Having said that, it\u2019s going to be a gradual process of as Bob indicated on one of the questions earlier, more even production cadence giving the contractors better visibility into what\u2019s coming at them. Overall we think that\u2019s the primary vehicle that we are going to use to help.","Clearly, we are paying market rate, Bob indicated that we\u2019re going to expect a little bit of cost inflation this year on the labor side and that\u2019s to be expected. So those are the primary areas, Ryan.","Ryan Gilbert","Okay great and you are seeing positive feedback from your sub-contractors on the increased spec levels?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Well, what they like, we already have quite a few lots in front of them, they like visibility into the production side. So, yes, to the extent that we can build on a more even cadence sprinkling and specking inventory as we have, that\u2019s more predictable for them allowing then to keep the cruise dedicated to our jobs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Alright, thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to get drill down, I think you kind of addressed it a little bit with Wieland, about 40 communities, which would kind of suggest that at least in the first half for the year will be the bulk of the community count growth, but maybe you are expecting a little bit on an organic basis, is that fair? And then the organic growth ex-Wieland would check in a little bit more in the second half. Is that the right way to think about it?","Richard Dugas","I think it is Mike, yes.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. And then in terms of the absorption impact of Wieland in the first half, obviously you had a nice acceleration into this most recent quarter, in terms of sales pace. Are you talking about maybe expecting overall company-wide absorption to be down low single-digits or would it be a greater type of number than that?","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Mike, we didn\u2019t give any specific commentary on that. We just wanted people to appreciate the fact that absorption rates are going to be slowed by the impact of all these new Wieland communities and their typical model of, say selling one or two a month in each community versus three or four in typical Pulte community. How many \u2013 exactly what that impact is overall on absorption rates is hard to tell. We just wanted people to factor that in. We don\u2019t forecast overall sales as you know. We just wanted you to keep that in mind in your models.","Michael Rehaut","Okay, all right great thanks.","Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","Sorry guys, I know the call is going long right now, but I wanted to talk just minute about Del Webb and just the active adult business. I think the absorption rates in active adult seem to be improving, but still lagging some of the other buyer groups. And just wondering if you noticed any performance differentials between say, newer Del Webb communities versus kind of the flagship communities and what else you can do to improve or accelerate active adult absorption?","Richard Dugas","That is a good question, this is Richard. The flagship communities if you will, we have really maximized the opportunity there some time ago. So those are kind of our steady run rate basis. The newer Del Webbs that we bring on though, typically are closer to the core center 500 to 1,000 lots, I would say overall better locations and we are really pleased with the results there. So the way I look at it Buck would be as active adult communities cycle over time for us to be concentrating on opportunities that are closer to city core vis-\u00e0-vis the larger kind of big cruise ship Del Webb operations of the past. Those are probably not going to happen again.","Having said that, we are pleased with the absorption rates we continue to see. You are right, they are typically lagging the others, but not by much. And we love the financial performance of those communities with strong margins and good returns.","Buck Horne","Okay thanks, and on the West Coast, you see in the strength in the west. I mean is there any noticeable differences between maybe California versus some of the other West Coast markets. Any granularity you can give on just the west region will be helpful.","Richard Dugas","Buck it was pretty broad based, strong, candidly some of that\u2019s given community count changes, for us overall. But we like our position, our northern California operation, as an example has fantastic land positions, we are continuing to show strength. We\u2019ve got a relatively small business up in Washington, but it\u2019s getting better. And Phoenix is doing quite well for us. So we have a big position in Phoenix and we have an excellent team in Phoenix and they do a great job. We\u2019re driving quite a bit of volume at very good margins there.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Q&A portion of the call. Mr. Zeumer I will turn the call back to you.","Jim Zeumer","Thanks John, thanks everybody for your time this morning.

Please go ahead, sir.","James P. Zeumer","Carolyn, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for participating in today's call to discuss PulteGroup's 2012 third quarter financial results. On the call today are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mike Schweninger, Vice President and Controller. Before we begin, copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted on our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com.

These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report today on PulteGroup's third quarter results, which show a continuation of the positive trends we have been experiencing throughout 2012. As reported in this morning's earnings release, key business metrics including orders, revenue, margins and of course, earnings, all showed meaningful year-over-year gains, and in certain instances, represent performance numbers not seen since 2006.","More specifically, PulteGroup's third quarter earnings of $0.30 per share are up from a reported loss of $0.34 per share last year and are the highest quarterly earnings we have posted since the third quarter of 2006.","The improvement in our overall operating performance was driven by a number of factors, but the ongoing expansion of PulteGroup's gross margin was clearly an important driver of the results.","At 21.6%, our adjusted third quarter gross margin showed an increase of 320 basis points over the prior year and a sequential gain of 130 basis points from the second quarter of 2012.","In addition to the 320 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin, we also realized an 80 basis point improvement in our overhead leverage as SG&A fell to 10.2% of home sale revenues. Taken in combination, it is clear that in just the past 12 to 18 months, PulteGroup's absolute and relative operating margins have improved dramatically. We recognize the hard work of our employees that went into delivering these gains and are very proud of their efforts.","Another important quarterly metric is the 27% increase in year-over-year net new orders and corresponding 43% increase in order dollars, which has driven our backlog to a much stronger position.","Our third quarter results and related 25% growth in PulteGroup's 9-month orders offer very encouraging signs about the healthier state of housing demand. As has been the case throughout the year, third quarter order growth of 27% was realized from 7% fewer communities.","Over the short run, growing absorption pace in existing communities rather than expanding our footprint is allowing us to appropriately work through our land pipeline in support of delivering better long-term returns on invested capital.","I want to stress this point on returns as it is clearly influencing the business decisions we are making today and will make tomorrow. I know some of you have heard this before, but I think it warrants repeating that we are focused on delivering better returns as we believe this is critical to creating greater shareholder value for our investors.","The keys to our success in this effort are well known: better margins, better overhead leverage, improved inventory turns and more effective allocation of capital. Margins, both gross and operating, are clearly improving and benefiting from better pricing, a better mix of community and house closings, overhead leverage and better control of our house cost, as approximately 15% of our third quarter closings, up from 10% of second quarter closings, have been value engineered or undergone related should-cost analysis.","Actions we have implemented to help support these results can be as obvious as the projects we invest in and the houses we build, to more subtle tactics around strategic pricing and reducing the amount of spec inventory we build. I would note that our third quarter finished spec number is 566 homes and is down 57% from last year and 5% from the prior quarter.","Margin gains have been dramatic, but we know that moving the needle on inventory turns will take time, given our land bank. We are, however, implementing the needed actions, which include monetizing the existing assets while remaining disciplined in terms of adding new land positions.","Although our net lot position and associated turns are improving slowly, the more immediate impact has been on our cash flow, which was positive in each of the first 3 quarters of 2012, a result that is certainly uncharacteristic for our company and, generally, the industry.","Overall, we are extremely pleased with the third quarter results, both in terms of absolute performance and how they position us for success over the remainder of 2012 and beyond.","Looking to broader industry trends, I will tell you that we entered this year with a conservative planning assumption that new home demand in 2012 would be comparable with 2011 at approximately 300,000 new home sales. Obviously, demand has been, and through the third quarter, continued to be, much more robust with industry-wide sales tracking roughly 25% above prior year levels.","The list of factors supporting this recovery is well known and spans from higher rents, lower home prices and low interest rates to the rapid reduction of existing home inventory and a limited supply of new homes on the market.","The corresponding change in other market dynamics, compared with the prior year, has been equally dramatic. As little as 12 to 18 months ago, industry conversations often included discussions about incentives, price discounts and acquisition of distressed land parcels.","Today, we have upwards of 70% of our markets reporting that they have raised selling prices during the quarter, and that price increases were implemented in a widening number of communities relative to the beginning of the year. Clearly, demand conditions have changed for the better.","We don't operate in a vacuum, however, so as you would expect, the stronger demand is beginning to stretch available labor resources.","In the second quarter, we talked about how labor constraints in certain markets were resulting in longer build times, higher costs or both. In select communities, we have actually been constraining sales, both to maximize price but also to avoid having our start dates get out too far.","With new home demand having accelerated quickly and having remained strong throughout the year, the number of markets feeling some degree of labor pressure is growing. In fact, almost all of our markets have now reached a point where labor pressures are being experienced to some degree. Certainly, this is not anything different than past cycles, so we feel comfortable with our ability to operate successfully in such an environment.","Not taking anything for granted, however, our operations continue to move forward on our value creation initiatives related to lowering overall house costs, shifting to more of a base house model with consumers selecting their choice of options, increasing plan throughput and sharing common plans. In fact, during the quarter, we committed to implementing what we call common plan management zones. We have been piloting the process in which we share and build common floor plans over multiple markets in Texas and the Southeast for the past 12 to 18 months. Based on the success of our initial pilots, we have decided to implement a series of these zones throughout the country in 2013.","All these actions are geared toward making PulteGroup a more efficient producer of homes and towards supporting our efforts of driving higher long-term returns.","Now let me turn over the call to Bob O'Shaughnessy for additional comments on our third quarter financial results. Bob?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Thank you, Richard. PulteGroup's third quarter results demonstrate that we're making excellent progress in our efforts to improve the company's operating and financial performance.","As Richard highlighted, our Q3 numbers indicate that our internal initiatives are allowing us to capitalize more effectively on the improved demand environment.","Specifically, our net orders in the period totaled 4,544 homes, representing an increase of over 27% versus last year. Consistent with the second quarter and our guidance for the year, this increase was generated from 7% fewer communities as we realized better absorption paces within our existing projects.","Looking a little deeper into our orders, each brand generated increases compared to the third quarter last year. On a year-over-year basis, our recorded orders increased 53% in our Pulte communities; 3% in our Centex communities, despite a 24% community count decline; and 23% in our Del Webb communities.","It's worth noting that sales within our Webb communities appear to be picking up, as the 23% year-over-year increase compares with increases of 6% in Q1 and 17% in Q2. Hopefully, this momentum can carry throughout in the coming quarters.","The mix of our orders was consistent with the second quarter of this year and break down 46% in Pulte, 28% Centex and 26% Del Webb.","Looking at our third quarter financial results, home sale revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 12% compared with last year. The increase in revenue was driven by a 6% increase in average selling price to $279,000, combined with a 5% increase in closings to 4,418 homes.","The increase in our average selling price reflect the continued shift in our product mix from the first-time buyer towards the move-up buyer, as well as price increases realized within our markets.","Our mix of closings in the third quarter was consistent with the second quarter of this year and break down 42% from Pulte, 33% from Centex and 25% from Del Webb.","In the third quarter of 2011, the closing mix was 36% Pulte, 37% Centex and 27% Del Webb.","I want to take a moment to address questions we've gotten recently related to our conversion rate, which represents the total number of our quarterly closing divided by our backlog at the end of the preceding quarter.","You will note that our conversion rate this quarter was 58%, which compares to 73% in the third quarter of last year. This lower percentage is due, in large part, to our decision 18 months ago to emphasize presale and minimize spec construction, which will naturally cause this ratio to be lower than a spec-heavy model. We are confident this strategic shift benefits us in terms of the metrics we use to evaluate our business performance, including revenues, margins, inventory turns and cash flows.","Going forward, we would expect our conversion rates to be lower than it was in previous years as we focus on higher-margin presale homes and a larger backlog, allowing more efficient and consistent delivery flow.","Looking at land sale revenues, we continue to execute on our strategy to evaluate, and where appropriate, to sell non-core land assets. During the third quarter, we generated land sale proceeds of $23 million, resulting in a net gain of $2 million.","Land sales can be difficult to forecast, but we plan to remain opportunistic with regard to selling additional land assets in the future.","As outlined on Page 7 of our webcast slides, the company recorded an adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 21.6%. This represents an increase of 320 basis points over the third quarter of 2011, and a sequential gain of 130 basis points from the second quarter of this year.","Similar to prior quarters, gross margin benefited from company-specific and industry-wide factors, including the improved demand and pricing environment, further expansion of our move-up buyer business, our strategic pricing initiatives and our ongoing efforts to lower house construction cost.","In the third quarter, we continued to remain disciplined in our overhead spend and benefited from the leverage of our increased revenue base. As a result, SG&A fell 80 basis points to 10.2% of revenues in the quarter. In total, our SG&A for the quarter was $125 million, which represents a $4 million increase over the third quarter of 2011.  The increase relates primarily to higher incentive compensation resulting from the company's improved operating and financial results.","Turning to Financial Services. We experienced another outstanding quarter, as we continue to benefit from our strong home sales activities and the favorable interest rate environment.","For the quarter, Financial Services produced $27 million of pretax income, which compares to $9 million in the third quarter of 2011.","Our current year results reflect a 19% increase in loan origination volume and continued higher gains on mortgage sales.","In total, third quarter originations amount to 3,073 loans. Our increased originations reflect the increased volume from our homebuilding operation, as well as an increase in our capture rate to 83%, up from 78% in 2011.","As you can see on Slide 10 of our webcast presentation, gross repurchase requests in the most recent quarter showed an increase in activity to the range of 150 to 200, up from the 50 to 150 request per month we've experienced in prior quarters.","Based on our review to date, the composition of -- overall profile of the underlying repurchase request has not changed materially. As we have indicated previously, we evaluate the reserves we have recorded related to repurchase requests every quarter. We have not adjusted our reserves in the current quarter, as our current estimate of liability is consistent with our reserves.","As we have also indicated, our liability estimates are based primarily on the number of requests we receive, including the length of time we believe such request will continue; our ability to refute or cure those requests; and the significance of the loss we will incur on each request.","We will continue to evaluate the impact of these elevated levels, including their impact on our assessment of the length of time requests may continue on our reserve estimates.","We've previously indicated that, assuming all factors impacting our reserve estimates remain unchanged, an extension of repurchase request beyond 2013 would result in additional reserves of approximately $25 million for each incremental year of activity we assume beyond 2013.","If the factors we consider on our reserve estimates change, the impact of each additional annual period may also change.","For perspective, if the level of requests we have received in recent quarters was assumed to continue, and again, all other factors being held constant, the additional reserve required for each incremental year of activity would increase from the previous estimate of $25 million to approximately $40 million to $45 million per year. We continue to focus on this issue and are seeking to resolve our outstanding exposures as efficiently and economically as possible.","Closing out my income statement comments, our consolidated net income was $117 million or $0.30 per share. Net income for the quarter included $11 million of tax benefits associated with the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters.","Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. This represents an increase of $243 million from the second quarter of this year, despite an outflow of $96 million in August to fund the maturity of certain of our notes.","Our approved cash position results from a number of factors, including the more efficient use of capital by our homebuilding operations for land acquisition and development; the reduction in the level of our spec house inventory; our non-core land asset strategy; and the return of $88 million from our mortgage operation, following the establishment of a new third-party line of credit to support its operation.","The combination of our more disciplined investment practices, improved operating performance and resulting positive cash flows has helped to lower PulteGroup's Q3 net debt to cash -- net debt to total capital to 39%. This compares to the net debt to cap of 50% at the end of 2011.","As you have likely seen, the company's announced a tender for up to $1 billion face amount of certain outstanding senior notes. The tender offer, details of which are available in last night's release, reflects our strong liquidity profile and is consistent with our previous comments, highlighting our desire to reduce our leverage.","It's important to note that us undertaking the tender is not restricting our ability to invest in the business. In fact, we increased our planned land investment during the quarter by $90 million to a full year total of $1 billion. This includes new lands, as well as the acceleration of certain land developments due to the strong sales environment.","Our liquidity remains strong, and we'll continue to evaluate the uses of such liquidity with an eye towards improving our financial returns.","I also want to take a moment to address questions we get about the accounting for our deferred tax assets, especially in light of the progress we continue to make in delivering sustained profitability.","As of September 30, 2012, we had a net deferred tax asset of $2.5 billion, which was fully reserved. Assuming the company remains profitable and the current business trends continue, including continuing improvements in the homebuilding industry, we believe that there may be sufficient evidence to support reducing a large portion of our valuation allowance during 2013.","With respect to potential Section 382 limitation related to the Centex transaction, we do not believe such limitations will significantly limit our ability to use future deductions. It's important to note that there's still a lot of work to be done between now and any potential change with regard to the deferred tax assets, and we'll provide updates to this as we progress.","Before turning the call back to Richard, let me review a few final data points. We ended the quarter with 707 active communities, down 7% from last year and consistent with our guidance range for the year. At quarter end, we had a total of 7,686 homes in backlog valued at $2.2 billion, the highest dollar value since the second quarter of 2008. And we ended the quarter with 6,800 homes under construction, of which 78% were sold and only 22% were spec.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Bob. Before opening the call to questions, I'll provide some additional comments on the market conditions we experienced across different geographies during the third quarter.","Broadly speaking, it's no surprise when I tell you that demand conditions remain positive. Generally, demand from New England down through Florida was strong, with notable levels of strength in the Northeast, Georgia and the Carolinas and both North and South Florida.","Demand here in the Midwest continue to pose significant increases over the prior year, and in certain markets, is even showing meaningful gains from the second quarter.","We have previously highlighted the strength in Michigan, but I would tell you that demand across all of our Midwest markets improved in the quarter. The second quarter pickup in demand that we noted in our Texas operations continued into the third quarter, as we realized solid year-over-year increases in all 4 major markets in Texas.","Demand out West was strong throughout the quarter, with high order rates ranging from the Pacific Northwest, down through Northern and Southern California and across into Nevada. I would add that demand in Arizona remains exceptional.","As we discussed last quarter, however, we have taken direct action to meaningfully slow our sales pace to avoid getting too far out of production in the Arizona -- ahead of production in the Arizona market.","With net new orders up 27% in units and 43% in dollars, clearly, we are capitalizing on the improved demand conditions and finding opportunities to raise prices in a growing percentage of our markets.","There were a number of very positive points in this morning's release, so just to summarize, over $100 million in after-tax earnings for the quarter, significant year-over-year and sequential expansion in gross and operating margins and strong cash flows, enabling us to lower our net debt to cap to below 40% and support a tender for as much as $1 billion of outstanding debt.","Let me thank our entire organization for their sustained commitment to the success of PulteGroup. Your hard work and implementation of key initiatives has been critical to the dramatic operating and financial gains we continue to deliver.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. At this time, we'll open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you be concise in your comments and limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. With that, operator, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to start and talk about the capital structure and, Bob, your comments about the tender not affecting the growth rate or the ability to grow. I'm kind of wondering if you can give us an idea if that's kind of a short-term, near-term, year, 12- to 18-month comment, or kind of a longer-term question. And I totally understand buying back the debt. You have excess cash in the balance sheet, makes a lot of sense. But as you look forward and as you kind of envision where you think the recoveries' going to go, does capital become more of a constraining issue? Or you can -- or can you support the growth that you see effectively through the cash that you're going to generate in the business?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Sure. We -- obviously, we put the tender out. We're excited to see where that goes. We have $1.6 billion  on the balance sheet today. Obviously, the fourth quarter is always going to be one of our best cash flow generating periods. We are fortunate, I guess, in one regard that we won't be a taxpayer so our earnings become purely cash accretive. So as we looked at our liquidity profile, although the leverage that we're taking back is fairly expensive, there is yield there. So we are comfortable with the decision to buy that back. We're giving a lot of the economics back to the holders, but still positive yield for us. In terms of your longer-term question, I think, as we look at the market, we feel pretty good and have said consistently that our land position will give us the opportunity to grow with the market. And as we look at capital allocation for future growth, obviously, we committed another almost $100 million to land acquisition and development during the fourth quarter. So I think we feel like we have the ability to do both with the given cash flow and cash position that we have today.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Great. And then just a follow-up question. Richard, you talked about the ability to successfully navigate the market, given the labor constraints that you're seeing. And I wonder if you can give some color on how you're seeing the subcontract or trades adjust to the improvement in demand that we've seen. We've gotten some color in our channel checks that some of the subs are concerned about bringing on additional labor just because they're not sure the pace of improvement that we've seen so far and this upturn is going to continue. Are you seeing that trend? Or are you seeing the subs kind of being willing to try to grow with you guys, and even though there are shortages, they try to adjust to what's happened in the market?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, David, it's a great question. I would say that earlier in the year, I was hearing more about subs not necessarily wanting to add personnel because of the concerns as to how sustained the recovery was. I'm hearing, as the year progresses, that more and more people are coming back to this space, as you might imagine, overall. I would also point out that I believe we have -- we, being the big builders, have an advantage, given our land supply. Obviously, our subcontractors want to keep their folks employed. And based on what they see out in front of them, while we're clearly facing some price pressure, I believe we're going to be very successful at being able to get our homes built and that's what our teams continue to report. So as I outlined in the prepared remarks, we've seen this movie before. We've operated successfully within it. And it's not a long-term concern, it's just something to be aware of.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Richard, you've spoken about the margin improvement. The 21.6% gross margin was pretty impressive. And recognizing this, you've made some significant changes in the cost structure of your company. Can you talk -- 2-part question. First part, how much of that is permanent versus how much of it do you think is just the benefit of the improving environment, with respect to less incentives, and certainly, some of the benefits from market absorptions? But can you talk maybe about permanent versus what would be industry growth rate normally? And then also, 21.6%, do you feel that with incentives decreasing, pricing improving, that you can go well beyond that and you're feeling pretty comfortable with the pretty sizable upside with pricing assuming staying very positive?","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks, Ivy. With regard to how permanent we feel kind of the environment is, I would suggest that a number of the things that we are doing internally, we believe, can be long-held gains for us. With regard to some of the structural changes we made, I mentioned on the prepared remarks our common plan management and focus on zones. We believe that's a structural change that's going to benefit us going forward. I also would point out that I mentioned that only 15% of the homes that we closed during Q3 have benefited from value engineering and should costing, and we fully expect that number to go up in the coming years. Having said that, certainly, some of the margin improvement that we've seen was from pricing. But as I indicated, we raised price in the quarter and upwards of 70% of our communities, and that's up fairly dramatically from where it was just a quarter or 2 ago. So we feel pretty good about that. I can't promise that forever and ever we can enjoy this kind of margin performance, given not knowing where the business is going to be going forward. I would also say that there is pressure on commodities. There's no question about that. And so we're not realizing every dollar or price increases to the bottom line. But we continue to feel confident in our ability to get more in pricing than we're getting in cost pressure. Moving to the question about where we go from here, I would say, as we said before, margins quarter-to-quarter are going to be choppy. And clearly, there won't be a straight line, continued sequential improvement every single quarter. But as we look into our backlog, we do see opportunity to move margins higher from here. So we feel good about that and expect that candidly in 2013.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Great. My second question is related to your buyer, the profile. Your -- certainly, across all price points and spectrums, can you talk a little bit about the traffic and people that are coming in the door and we're seeing such improved environment? What are people telling you? And how is the quality of the buyer in terms of credit? And the stringency in mortgage is still pretty much at the high levels, but it seems as if it's not an impediment. So maybe kind of a busy question, but if you can address those, I'd appreciate it.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, thank you. Listen, with regard to the last part first. With regard to mortgage availability, it still continues to be tight. It's been tight for the better part of a couple of years. We're not seeing a big change there. So we're pleased with our ability to still get buyers, not only to the sales table that closed today. And Mike can speak maybe later to our FICO scores, if you'd like that, but they continue to stay strong. With regard to the buyer profile, the move-up buyer continues to be very strong for us, the Pulte buyer. I would point out, so does Centex. On a same-store sales basis, we feel good about it. The notable shift this quarter that we're beginning to see, and Bob alluded to this in his remarks, is the Del Webb buyer. It appears that the Del Webb buyer is slowly, but surely, coming back into the business. We kind of predicted that they would lag the other categories in terms of coming back. But as existing home stock falls, as that buyer gets more and more comfortable that kind of housing is here to stay in terms of more of a sustained recovery, we're seeing some additional action. So we're going to watch through the traditionally stronger selling season for us in our Southern markets for Del Webb in the coming couple of quarters to see if that's going to continue. But that's probably the one shift that I would mention vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the year in category.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Michael Rehaut.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You've made great progress in terms of getting your order growth back on track, despite the community  count growth you're streamlining. I was wondering, given the better-than-expected or increased amount of land spend, and obviously, you guys continue to see opportunities in the market, combined with already a very good land bank, community count growth plans, is that something that would shift to a positive in '13? And how do you see that coming about? And perhaps, even by segment, as you highlighted the Centex, the community count down above average.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, this is Richard. I can help a little bit. We're not going to comment on community count. As we go forward, we'll have maybe more to say about that on the next quarterly call regarding 2013. I will tell you that the land evaluation process, in terms of incremental spend, is an evergreen process for us. We're very, very focused on staying attuned to what's happening in the market. And I think we demonstrated a couple times here in 2012 that we're going to be flexible and appropriate with regard to the spend where we need it. The fact is, we have a lot of leverage available from existing assets, particularly in Del Webb, in many of our markets. Other markets, we need to invest, and that's exactly what we're doing. So we feel very comfortable with the progress we're making. Our focus is clearly on ROIC, which we believe directly correlates to shareholder returns, and that's where it's going to stay. Having said that, we're continuing to monitor our land position and are investing appropriately. But more to say about community count on our future call.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I guess, the second question, on the Financial Services side, you had a nice improvement in income versus 2Q and certainly, you had some better revenues to help with that. But were there any other drivers in terms of the market improvement and profitability? And I guess, secondly, if I could just more broadly on the financial and mortgage area, appreciate very much the comments and scenario analysis on the put-backs. I know it might be sensitive or difficult to talk about, but is there any additional color you can give in terms of where you might be in terms of talks with the other side or the different counter-parties? We've seen another -- one of your peers be able to settle some of those -- some of that activity in a more conclusive fashion.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","To the first question, the profitability is primarily, as we talked about, volume from the builder. So our increased volume helps. And it is the interest rate environment. We are experiencing very healthy gains on sale, and that's really the driver. To your second question, we have expressed the desire to try and resolve these. We are obviously in constant dialogue with investors. We don't have anything more to say about any progress on that.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Richard, so you're not going to talk about community count. I understand that, and the sooner the better. But I think you guys are in a very unique position, as you've already highlighted, to actually grow and delever. And that's because you're over capitalized on land that you already have, which there's only a few builders in that position. So thinking about that, can you talk about the factors that will drive your thinking to bring out more communities, as it relates to higher absorptions that you're seeing? Is there kind of a litmus test there, realizing all communities are different? And second, your desire to utilize your existing land bank that is available to you.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. Ken, that's a great question. And let me be perfectly clear. Our decisions are motivated by what generates the highest ROIC for us. And as you might appreciate, with 707 active communities, we're monitoring it community by community. As an example, we have many, many Del Webb communities that could reasonably expect meaningful increases in same-store sales growth, with only putting additional development dollars into those and not reinvesting in anything beyond that. And that would be a very, very nice scenario. For us, that would be very beneficial. So those communities, we're not looking to add community count, and that's why we think the community count metric is a little bit overplayed. For us, it's more about what happens to the total revenue, total leverage, obviously, earnings and therefore, the corresponding impact on return, given the size of our balance sheet. So as we speak, we continue to monitor every single community. And where we think we have an opportunity to invest appropriately in return-friendly transactions, we are doing that. So I think, if you look at what's happened to us this year, our order growth rates being very healthy despite a community count decline, in fact, what we have predicted is continuing to come true, which is that same-store sales growth is going to lead the way initially. And we find ourselves candidly in a very flexible position. We have the ability. We're generating so much cash to pay down our debt and continue to reinvest in the business. So I guess, without getting into too much granular detail, you and everybody else should feel very comfortable that we're paying attention to every one of those levers. And our goal is to drive a better return in coming years, and we are, this year. And this year, we think we've demonstrated a better return than we've had previously. So we've been caught in the past before with focusing too much on growth candidly. We have a lot of discipline within the company right now around expanding all the other levers that drive return, most notably margin and SG&A. So we continue to be pleased with our progress there. And we're not going to let an investment opportunity pass us by that we feel like we should take. And we're looking at it each and every day.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. And I guess, if I could just take it to the next level there. In '06 -- excuse me, '05, you had roughly 6 absorptions per month. And I think, common how much Del Webb would play into that, given the large community base where you can drive a lot of volume to it. And this is -- the main question now is, have you roughly $700 million mothballed in active land inventory? Could you help us frame out how many lots that is, A? B, how many of your total loan lots are finished? And this gets to the fact you can delever during your growth, which is actually a very attractive risk-adjusted framework for you guys versus other people and it starts with a double, with all that mothballed stuff really being brought back online. But main piece, inactive, how many lots that is and finished lots.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ken, there's a lot in that so I'll take the first part and then turn it over to Bob and maybe Mike for a little bit of additional commentary. First of all, with regard to Del Webb, I think we've commented before publicly that, at our peak in '05, we had Del Webb communities generating anywhere from 750 to 1,000 units per single community. While nobody's predicting that, I will tell you we don't have any -- doing more than like 250 today. So that business has the ability to ramp up and ramp up nicely. And candidly, we've talked about the ability to reduce our overall land bank and reinvest in other land. That would be a great scenario for us, if Del Webb continues on a positive trend than we've seen. With regard to mothballed assets, I believe, recently, that we've been able to bring on about 15 mothballed communities. Beyond that, Bob, if you have any more color?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, we haven't, Ken, given a mothballed asset lot count or value, candidly. So I think what we do is actually look at it. And if mothballed means different things to different builders, certainly, we've got a longer land base since Richard talked it in the Webb communities. But we are focused on wherever it's appropriate taking assets, either that are non-core and selling them, if it's appropriate, or opening up communities.","Michael J. Schweninger","Just to finish it, maybe give some data points on finished lots in total, not for mothballed, but just our total portfolio. We do have 30,035 finished  lots we own. We control 35,754 in total, of which 7,900 are related to house.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a housekeeping issue. I just assume that you all have somewhere in the order of about 1,200 model homes, and I just was hoping you could update us on that number. But more broadly, and more strategically, I was curious about your gross margin commentary. Last quarter, I believe, you made the comment that you thought that normalized gross margins in the business could get 20%, 25% -- 20% to 22% on your basis when you calculate it. But then it would \"take a couple of years\" I think, is what you said. Was curious as to -- since you just put up a 21.6%, how you're thinking maybe evolving there.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Steve. This is Richard. Listen, things have panned out pretty nicely for us, perhaps even better than we anticipated. We've got a nice benefit from mix in the quarter. We clearly got some pricing in the quarter. We clearly got some house cost. But just to be clear, our 20% to 22% was a non-adjusted number. So there's still several hundred basis points to go there when you take out the effective interest.","Michael J. Schweninger","Yes, from a model perspective, we're at 1,120 models at the end of the quarter.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, let's switch to the put-back. I mean, that was really great, the disclosure you just gave. But one question that I had relates to sort of from our perspective, trying to figure out how long it might be that these elevated level of put-backs may occur. And in that regard, can you tell us what the current vintages are of the put-backs? Is there any way to characterize it, particularly on a relative basis to maybe what you're experiencing a year ago?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes. We haven't seen a dramatic change in any of the elements that we look at, and one of them is the year of origination. Today, we had talked about that it was primarily 6 and 7. That is still true. The severity of loss hasn't changed much. So again, what we're seeing is a continuation of the same. Obviously, we continue to research them, but we haven't seen a change.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bob, if I could just follow on just a couple more questions on the put-back. The volume went up this quarter. One, is there -- what do you think the reason is for that? What's going on there? And then two, when you say in future years, your reserve through '13, does that mean -- at what level do put-backs need to drop to that you wouldn't have to reserve for '14 or '15? And then I just wanted to make sure I was clear in the last -- in your prepared remarks. You said if history holds another $25 million a year, if it goes beyond '13, but if the more recent quarter holds, that goes up to $40 million to $45 million. Is that accurate?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Yes, what we've -- sorry, the last one was -- the $40 million to $45 million is based on a recent activity, not necessarily the fourth -- the third quarter. We tend to look at these things over time. 2 months or 3 months, we don't think necessarily makes a trend, so we have to see what that really evolves into. The question on why volume is up, it is, at least as best we can tell, just normal process from investors. And then for '13, extending out beyond that, again, put-backs have always been part of the business. They were around but just much less pronounced than they are today. And so we would have to see a return to that for there not to be any impact in '14 and '15. Again, we're evaluating that as we go.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you look at your debt tender, your cash level, ignoring what you had generate in the fourth quarter, and I would be interested in how much you think you can generate there. But you dropped down to $500 million to $600 million or so if all $1 billion is tendered. I guess, what level are you comfortable taking that down to? Do you envision putting revolver in place to compensate for some of the cash going out the door? Or would you all look at convert and deal or future debt deal? And then also, in the past, you all had said it was very expensive to take this debt out. I guess, what's changed in your thought process there?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, certainly, to the extent that we were able to take in $1 billion, we expect to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter. We haven't given any guidance on that. But we did generate $240 million plus of cash in the third quarter. In terms of credit facility, we've looked at that and our view is we want to be able to put the best credit package in front of people. So the more positive earnings performance we can do, the better we're going to do in terms of the facility we can put in place. If we were in a position 3 months from today or soon as the tender were over, where we felt we needed to go raise capital, we think we could do it in the capital markets pretty inexpensively and efficiently, whether that would be senior subordinated notes or convertible. We'd evaluate based on economics at the time. So we think -- then Richard used the word earlier, it's about flexibility. We have the opportunity to make decisions and from relatively -- we have choices. The other question you asked is why are we doing this now? It is expensive. We've said that from the start. Unfortunately, it is what the market is telling us the bonds are worth. And as we look at it, we get a positive yield versus the cash sitting on the books. So elected to do this today, again, trying to drive down the leverage we've talked about wanting to do that.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about Del Webb. You talked about pricing overall of 7% communities during the quarter. I guess -- wondering if we -- if you were to look at Del Webb, the order trend's improving now. Are you seeing any pricing power at Del Webb? Or are we still several quarters from that? Just a little clarity there.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Dan. I think Del Webb would be a segment that we'd want to drive a lot more volume before we got real aggressive on the price side. I don't have detailed specifics by community for you. I'm certain that each of our Del Webb communities offers 3 or 4 different lines of product. And probably, in some communities, we've got lot positions and product that's in high demand where we are getting some price. But generally speaking, we're going to look to drive much better returns by a lot more volume in Webb before we drive prices up there aggressively because that would be the best ROIC decision.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And next, in terms of the land development, you talked about increasing that based on stronger sales of this. How much of that is additional phases of existing communities versus bringing on new communities here?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Sorry, of the current year spend?","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I'm guess just wondering, as you increase that, just how much are you looking forward in really trying to bring on more community, sort of developing raw land that you have in communities that aren't currently operating versus just other phases of existing communities here.","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Well, again, we're going to commit about $1 billion in 2012. Roughly 1\/3 of it is going to be buying land. The rest is land and land development.","Richard J. Dugas","And Dan, the incremental $90 million is a mix of both that we just talked about.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. Of the land and land development spend that you're going to do this year, how much of that is already working for you? Meaning, how many of those -- how much of that money is -- have communities tied to it that are already open? And how much are going to be opened for next year?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, I don't have the granularity on that, Rob. It's fair to say it's a combination. I would suggest that the majority of it is likely already working for us as newer phases and new lots from existing communities come on. But there's not an insignificant amount of new projects. Exactly when those come on, it's a continual revolving door as we close some and open others. So sorry, I -- we don't have that level of detail.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to see if you could talk a little about -- a little bit more about your common plan management zones and how large are these zones and what percent of markets was this -- that have this in 2012 and how much -- what are you going to ramp that up to in 2013.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes. So basically, the idea here is to drive our throughput for floor plan up much higher than it is today. And what that means is the number of closings that we can get from an individual plan that has been consumer validated and design with the consumer in mind upfront and value engineered it before it ever goes into production and contrast that with an existing set of floor plans where we may go in and attempt to take cost out. It's a lot easier to do it on the upfront. So we've been piloting a process starting in Texas, and we've expanded it to the Southeast where several cities, all of the major cities in Texas and now all of the major cities in the Southeast, are operating under the mindset based on consumer research that buyers in those 2 geographies will accept and be happy with product that can be shared among those geographies. So instead of value engineering a floor plan in Dallas, for an example, and getting 30 or 50 closings to benefit from it, maybe we can get 300 closings benefit from it because all the cities in Texas are now using it. So the idea is that, over 2013, we will expand that concept to the rest of the country and implement additional geographic product zones. Now I also gave a statistic in Q2 that about 10% of our closings that actually came through in Q2, and that went up to 15% in Q3, benefited from value engineering and should costing in the actual closing volume. So even though we have a zone implemented already in Texas and one in the Southeast, it's going to take a while to get all of the floor plans through that commonly managed product. So we see this as a 2- or 3-year effort before we can drive that 10% or 15% number much higher, but our candid expectations are to go much, much higher with that. And that's one of the sources of ongoing margin expansion that we believe we have.","Operator","We have the next question from the line of Megan McGrath from MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up a little bit on your commentary about restricting yourself based on a couple of geographies. Is labor the only real bottleneck you're seeing? Or are you experiencing any other bottlenecks in the system like permitting or leaner land development or anything like that?","Richard J. Dugas","I would suggest labor is only a small part of it. A lot of it has to do with how far do you want to carry your backlog. I mean, we saw sales explode in Arizona earlier this year and made a very conscious decision to slow it down because we didn't want a backlog. Keep in mind, like in Q2 of this year, extending out a year or more. So Megan, it's based on, in some cases, things like labor constraints or permit delays of the given municipality. But the far more broad reason is how far do you want to let the sales run out and how far do you actually want your backlog out. We generally, as an example, feel like that we can protect our cost for roughly 6 months. And so we may let a backlog in a given community go out to, say, 9 months or something like that. But generally speaking, 2 to 3 quarters worth of backlog in a given community is, in our opinion at PulteGroup, about where you want to have it to maintain relatively consistent ability to start, et cetera. Now I would suggest if the market ramps up further from here, both permitting and entitlement issues and labor issues, to some degree, may limit your ability to get out and deliver those units in a quick fashion. But I don't want to overplay the labor issue. It's more a conscious decision on our part on -- frankly, we want to hold back some dry powder for the potentially improved pricing environment and our ability to protect our cost out in the future. And just wanted to comment on that. We are seeing that in more than just Arizona. We've got communities in Florida, D.C., Northern California and other places where we're purposely restricting sales.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess that was -- you partially answered my question, but I think that's sort of what I was getting at. If there were no restrictions in terms of labor or supplies, is this sort of the maximum amount of growth that you're comfortable with at this point of the cycle, given where pricing is? Because expectations are fairly lofty for 2013, I think, on a national basis, but I don't know if builders are really comfortable pushing units beyond a certain point. And so it sounds like even if there weren't labor constraints or other physical constraints that you are -- you wouldn't -- you are sort of limiting construction a little bit to maximize price in the long term. Is that fair?","Robert T. O'shaughnessy","Megan, it's fair to some degree, but let me be clear about this. You said that if we didn't have labor constraints or other constraints, in some cases, those constraints are lot availability, as an example, so you've got real strong performance in a given community. You thought you were going to sell 50 in a given year and all of a sudden you're at 100, you can only ramp up a lot production so quickly. So we are solving for the highest possible ROIC. And in many cases, we're finding, at least in the short term, that's through price versus additional pace. So I don't want to give you the impression we'd rather not drive volume, but we do have to live within the environment of a combination of factors of lot availability, labor availability, our ability to get permits. In some municipalities, they're limiting us on the number of permits we can pull. So it's not so much what the builder wants to do, it's what we believe is the smartest business decision, given the environment we're in.","Operator","We have no further questions at the time.

We'll also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statement about PulteGroup's future performance.","Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.

This risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","Now let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. During our last conference call we commented about seeing a strengthening of demand starting midway through the fourth quarter and carrying into the first few weeks of January. I\u2019m pleased to report that the momentum and demand which began building in Q4 continued through the first quarter and has gotten the spring selling season off to a good start.","Since the housing cycle turned positive several years ago we\u2019ve stated our belief that unlike recoveries in the past we didn\u2019t expect to see a rapid V shaped rebound. Our expectations were that this would be a longer more gradual recovery with periods of faster and slower growth but with an overall upward bias consistent with the sustained rebound in housing demand.","The early read on the industry's 2015 spring selling season it is that we\u2019re now in one of those periods of improving demand. Having participated in a number investor meetings over the past couple of months, one of the questions we\u2019re often asked is what has been the catalyst for the improvement in the country\u2019s housing demand. In the absence of a single dramatic change in any of the underlying demand factors it is likely a culmination and continuation of market dynamics.","First, with Boomers and Millennials acting as powerful bookends certainly the demographics are favorable and supportive of an ongoing rebound in demand. Millennials maybe doing things later but their desire for home ownership is well documented and our strong Centex results which Bob will discuss shortly support this thesis.","Turning to active adults with the youngest boomers just now passing 50, this group remains a tremendous source of future demand and our Del Webb brand is unmatched in its ability to serve these buyers.","Second, interest rates remain low and with recent cuts in FHA fees the monthly payment has become a little less expensive for many potential homeowners. The mortgage market generally remains tight and we don\u2019t expect any material change in credit availability anytime soon but every little bit helps as our Centex results suggest.","And third, consumer sentiment and the job market trends have certainly been positive with more than 3 million jobs created over the past year. While these numbers jump around from month-to-month there are clear signs that point to an improving economy and a rising number of household formations.","Looking ahead along with more jobs we\u2019d like to start seeing more wage inflation which should make it easier for would-be home buyers to afford a mortgage. Given the acceleration in US housing demand in the early stages of spring selling season our expectations are that the strengthening of demand is sustainable and should drive better new home sales for all of 2015.","Like the overall industry PulteGroup experienced strong demand in Q1 and is well positioned to deliver yet another year of strong operating and financial performance in 2015. First quarter sign-ups of 5,139 homes were up 6% over last year on a 5% increase in community count. I am pleased by the fact that we were able to increase sales while maintaining high absorption paces without pushing incentives meaningfully during the period.","Consistent with our value creation strategy having strong sign-ups per community at high margins is a more efficient business model for PulteGroup in trying to drive volume aggressively. Our continued steady improvement in return on invested capital these last several years indicates our strategy is working. One of the things we have emphasized during this housing cycle is the need to focus on better located properties which typically mean staying with the better closer end locations and within established areas of buyer interest.","For the most part buyer demand in the secondary locations throughout our markets remain tepid. So even though the land may be cheaper, it doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a good investment for us. The strong margin performance we continue to enjoy is partly the result of sticking to our land investment discipline. Speaking of land investment the 5% increase in community count that we reported understates the amount of activity actually taking place in terms of getting new communities open.","In the first quarter we grand opened almost 60 new neighborhoods which keeps us on track with previous guidance that we expect to open upwards of 200 new communities in 2015. Turning over 10% of our communities in a quarter is a lot of work especially in today\u2019s environment were entitlement and land development delays grow increasingly common.","We of course track the progress and performance of our communities in relationship to their original project plans and a number of the communities end up running behind schedule in terms of when they register their first sign-up.","Still through a lot of hard work for our land teams we are getting the job done and I am optimistic we can reach our community count guidance for this year. We are encouraged by market conditions during the closing months of 2014 and through the first few months of 2015 and remain positive about expected housing trends for the next several years. ","Now, let me turn over the call to Bob for a detailed review of our first quarter results. Bob?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Against the backdrop of improving conditions that Rich discussed, our first quarter operating results were in line with our expectations and with the guidance we provided on our last call. More importantly our Q1 results have well positioned to deliver another year of excellent operating and financial results. Looking at our first quarter numbers home-building revenues were $1.1 billion which is consistent with last year.","Our current quarter revenues reflected 2% or $6700 increase in average selling price to $323,000 offset by 2% decrease in closing the 3365 homes. Our conversion rates in the first quarter dropped from the prior-year as the production was negatively impacted by a number of factors including weather in certain markets which hindered land development and house construction, a continuing challenging municipal entitlement environment, and tight labor resources.","We expect that we will be able to get our production related closings back on schedule over the balance of the year with the majority of the delayed closings occurring in the third and fourth quarters.","The 2% increase in average selling price for the quarter was driven by price increases realized in each of our brand with Centex being up 2% to $208,000 and Pulte and Del Webb each increasing by less than 1% to $387,000 and $325,000 respectively. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a continuation of recent trends in our mix as Pulte continued to increase as a percentage of our total closings. More specifically closings in the first quarter break down as follows: 45% of closings from Pulte, 30% from Del Webb and 25% from Centex. This compares to 41%, 32% and 27% in the first quarter of last year, but it\u2019s consistent with the fourth quarter of last year.","Gross margins for the first quarter was 22.7% which is down a 110 basis points from last year, but it is in line with the 2015 outlook we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Our Q1 margin reflects higher land, labor and material costs as well as the impact of acquisition accounting associated with the Dominion transaction which impacted our Q1 margin by approximately 30 basis points.","These headwinds were partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from our deleveraging over the last two years. Looking at option revenues and lot premiums in the quarter, we continue to realize higher dollars on both lines. In the quarter option revenues per closing increased 13% or $5700 over the prior year, while lot premiums in the period increased by 3% or $400. Sales discounts in the quarter totaled 2.2% per home which is up about 60 basis points from last year, a little change for the fourth quarter.","Given our strong Q1 margin performance along with ongoing opportunities from our value creation initiatives and our positive view of the market we continue to target full-year 2015 gross margins of approximately 23%. As we\u2019ve said in the past there will be movement in margins up or down as we move from quarter-to-quarter and dependent upon the mix of closings.","SG&A costs in the first quarter totaled $161 million or 14.8% of home sale revenues compared with $145 million or 13.3% of home sale revenue last year. The higher SG&A spend in the period reflects investments we\u2019re making in people and information systems as well as increased start-up cost associated with the large number of new communities we are opening this year.","The overhead spend in Q1 was consistent with previous guidance for 2015 SG&A expenditures to be in the range of $160 million to $165 million per quarter. Our financial services operations reported first quarter pretax income of $5 million compared with $22 million last year. Note that last year\u2019s pretax income included $19 million benefit related to the reversal of mortgage repurchase reserves.","Capture rate for the period improved 82% up from 78% last year. Our reported Q1 income tax expense of $41 million represents an effective tax rate of 42.6% which is higher than our previous guidance of 38%. The higher tax rate for the period reflects the charge of $0.02 per share relating to an adjustment to our deferred tax assets resulting from a change in our perspective effective tax rate due to tax planning initiatives. We currently estimate that the company normalized rate for future quarter this year will remain year our previous guidance of 38%.","On the bottom line the first quarter net income was $55 million or $0.15 per share compared with net income $75 million or $0.19 per share last year. Note that our prior year results include $0.02 per share of net benefit relating to the reverse of mortgage repurchase reserves which was partially offset by charges in connection with debt retirement activity.","Shipping to homebuilding operations the company had 5387 homes under construction at the end of the quarter of which 19% respect. As a percentage construction activity this is comparable with the prior year. At the end of March our finish spec inventory totaled over 345 homes so we continue to maintain a tight control on our spec production. In the first quarter we improved approximately 2000 lots for purchase and finish the period with the 135,000 lots under control.","Our lot position includes 39,000 lots controlled under option. This represents 29% of our lots which is up from less than 26% last year. Of our controlled lots approximately 23% are finished with 18% currently underdeveloped. We spent $484 million on land in the quarter of which 49% was for development of exciting position and 51% was for acquisition.","That spend rate is behind our full year authorization at $2.4 billion, this is due to the fact that the timeline in a number of land transactions have gotten longer as municipal accruals and\/or land development is taking more time, but we still have a lot in the pipeline and are working hard to get deals approved and into production. Even though housing demand in 2014 was up only slightly over the prior year, land prices did not retreat and according to our division President have actually risen in 75% of our markets.","As we\u2019ve consistently indicated we intend to remain disciplined in our investment in the business and only fund projects that meet our return thresholds. In support our broader value creation objectives we continue allocating capital consistent with the priorities we articulated most recently at our investment day.","First to invest in the business and pay dividends then to opportunistic M&A of any excess funds being returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchase activity. During the quarter we repurchased 4.6 million shares for a $100 million or $21.75 per share. This level of activity is comparable to Q4 and reflects a stated strategy of being systematic in our approach to share buyback rather than trying time to market.","We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and with the debt to capital ratio of 28%. Our debt to cap is unchanged from the prior year. I will note that we're likely to use the portion of our cash to retire $238 million in bonds which mature in the second quarter of this year.","We passed the balance sheet with sign-ups in the quarter increased 6% to 5,139 homes. On a dollar basis sign-up revenue increased 6% to $1.7 billion. By brand unit sign-ups increased 13% at Pulte, and 6% at Centex and decreased 7% at Del Webb. The decrease at Del Webb is due to the close out of a number of selling efforts in Del Webb communities.","Absorption phases increased 8% at Centex and were essentially flat at Pulte and Del Webb. We are certainly encouraged by the improved sales pace among entry level buyers and particularly in some of our largest Centex communities which are experiencing notable increase in sales phase. For the quarter we operated from 613 communities which is up 5% from the same period last year.","We continue to forecast operating from approximately 620 communities in each quarter of the year and are on track to open over 200 new communities in 2015. One last data point we ended the quarter with a backlog of 7,624 homes valued at $2.6 billion which is up from 7,199 homes valued at $2.4 billion in March of last year.","Now let me turn the call back to Richard for some final comments.","Richard J. Dugas","Thanks Bob, as I talked about at the beginning of the call for a variety of factors the spring selling season was off to a very good start with improving traffic, manageable inventories and select pricing opportunities across many of the markets we serve. At a regional level many of the trends we have discussed during the number of the previous earnings conference calls continue to develop during the first quarter of 2015. More specifically on the East Coast we saw very solid demand up and down the coast with Florida and the Southeast experiencing strong buyer interest throughout the period while demand improved in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets as the quarter progressed.","Once again the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida realized the strongest demand some of which was likely people looking to escape yet another harsh winter. Heading towards the middle of the country conditions in the Midwest were generally stable for the quarter although like the East we did see demand improved slightly as the quarter progressed.","As I know it\u2019s an area of focus let me spend a little extra time on Texas. In total Texas sign-ups were down 5% in the quarter mostly as a result of the closeout of several large communities in Austin and San Antonio which would be yet to be replaced. Demand in Dallas held up reasonably well while Austin and San Antonio were slightly weaker in the quarter.","Specific to Houston sales in the quarter were flat with the prior year although demand slowed as the quarter progressed particularly at the higher price points. So far the impact of lower oil prices seems manageable and with oil prices seeming to a bottom we are optimistic that Texas will continue to be a strong market. Our West conditions held up well during the quarter, but the market, the submarket and the community location all matter as we continue to experienced better demand on a coast of California and we close certain locations around Phoenix, Las Vegas and Albuquerque.","On our last call we mentioned our newest Del Webb community called [indiscernible] and Albuquerque. The community comprises 550 homes roughly seven miles from downtown. The community which is open very well is part of an expanding portfolio of projects designed to serve active adult buyers, we want to be closer to a city center and the amenity such locations offer. In the coming quarters and years I expect you will see us open more communities for active adults expanding a variety of sizes, amenity offerings, locations and brands.","Overall, we are pleased with our demand developed in the quarter and during the first few weeks of April. We are particularly encouraged by the improved experience in our Centex communities. We are optimistic that this is the beginning of a more substantial recovery in the entry level which is really missing piece of the housing recovery to date. Assuming there are no dramatic changes in the U.S. or globally to have a material impact on employment trends, consumer confidence or interest rates, new home sales should see continued gains in 2015.","PulteGroup is also well positioned to see improved operating and financial performance as the quarters progressed given the opportunity for increasing margins and greater overhead leverage as delivery volume increased over the course of the year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.","As the year progresses we will continue to advance our key value creation initiatives and focus on delivering high returns on invested capital. At the end of our formal remarks by recognizing and thanking all of our employees for their tireless efforts to deliver a great home buying experience to our customers everyday. Our success only possible through your passionate commitment.","Now, I turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer","Thank you, Richard. We will now open the call for questions. So that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Ryan, if you explain the process, we will get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask I guess Houston being a big topic and a wide range of comments so far from some of the builders that you guys are one of the few to talk about some slowing, but it seems to be very dependent on submarkets, so I was wondering if you could just specify kind of which submarkets within Houston not just that price point but kind of around the area have you seen the impacts trying to get a sense of how isolated it is or broad.","Richard J. Dugas","Mike, this is Richard, in talking to our leadership team it's fairly consistent around the whole Metro area of Houston, but as indicated higher price points seem to be a little bit slower. We're very pleased with demand of the lower price points. But I wouldn\u2019t note any particular submarkets has been stronger or weaker than others.","Michael Dahl","Got it. And I guess if you - the comment on Houston being flat for the quarter, but then demand slowing through, is there any sense if you\u2019d give us in terms of magnitude so that January started up year-over-year and then February and March were down by how much?","Richard J. Dugas","No, I think the reason we noted it Mike is that typically you would see stronger demand in March then you would say in February or January and we did not see that through the quarter. I don\u2019t have any specific on exactly how many units it was I would point out that but Houston is an important market for us we go very balanced portfolio throughout not only Houston but also through the state of Texas in the country. So frankly we are not particularly worried about it and continue to like the overall benefit that lower oil prices give a whole country as opposed to the headwinds potentially for Houston.","Michael Dahl","Right, okay, thank you.","Richard J. Dugas","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael J. Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Richard J. Dugas","Hello, Mike.","Michael J. Rehaut","First question I had was just on pricing trends; you noted I believe at the beginning of your remarks Richard that you didn't push meaningfully in terms of incentives to achieve the sales that you were able to book, so I was hoping maybe to get a little more granular if there's any regions that maybe saw pricing power a little better than expected I guess outside of the regional commentary that you gave just specific to prices and incentives if there are any trends that you know maybe surprised a little bit to the upside or downside?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Mike, it\u2019s Richard again, good question. I think as opposed to regional trends which frankly we felt that the country was pretty consistent what we continue to be pleased with is our ability to drive option revenue and lot premiums higher and this is the multiple quarters in a row that Bob has commented that we have been able to take those numbers up. That\u2019s indicative of a fairly healthy market. As we indicated in our prepared remarks we do have higher input cost land as an example coming through the income statement which everybody does.","But I would say we generally believe that the pricing environment is more favorable than not as we go through the balance of the year. So we are optimistic as we indicated we are guiding for 23% margins for the year implying a little bit of growth through the balance of the year so we feel good about pricing.","Michael J. Rehaut","Great, no, I appreciate that. I guess the second question, you highlighted the sales pace by brand and Centex kind of standing out there a little bit. Bob we talked about in the past kind of your focus on exploring opportunities for building the Centex brand or building that out a little bit potentially to the extent of that market appears to be a little bit more favorable and I know that absorption was a big component of whether or not the economics might become more favorable.","I was hoping maybe you could talk about the \u2013 kind of where you are in the process of exploring greater opportunities for Centex, obviously there was also a slide on the Investor Day about kind of looking at that brand in 2015 for land opportunities and obviously the economics have to work. So any thoughts around that would be helpful.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, you are exactly right, Mike, we are focused on it as a buyer group in the whole of the Millennials and so we are doing some strategic work around how to approach that marketplace.","In terms of how we buy land around that \u2013 that hasn\u2019t changed, we are still focused on returns and what we're seeing still to this point is that closer in is where people are choosing to live and so we are seeing better opportunities to drive paces at prices that make sense in that move up space and in the active adult space.","I think if we continue to see absorption rates increasing with solid pricing in the first time I think it will make more land available or attractive for that buyer group. So certainly we're focused on it because it is such a big cohort I wouldn't say we've seen a change in our buying patterns around that, but we are looking at ways to serve that group more specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim","Yes, thanks very much guys. Stephen Kim from Barclays. Let me just follow-up if I could on the margin trajectory improving over the course of the year comment. I think you are talking about gross margins as well as SG&A and I just wanted to ask about how margins typically progress through the year, I mean generally a lot of builders first quarter gross margins are generally lower just by the virtue of the fact that you have some marketing expenses associated with community rollout but you don\u2019t have as many deliveries and that kind of thing. And I was wondering if that dynamic was actually going to be at work this year also and if that is kind of what is giving you confidence about your gross margin maybe improving sequentially from what we saw this quarter? Or if there is something else at work?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Well, I think Stephen the commentary was actually around gross margins, not operating margins, so SG&A wouldn\u2019t be part of that, so our SG&A we\u2019ve confirmed that we still think that 160 to 165 a quarter is a good number. And in terms of the gross margins itself as we look at the backlog and as we look at the overall housing in market and the fact that we will no longer have kind of suppression that came from the purchase accounting that we see opportunity and candidly we\u2019ve obviously guided to a higher annual rate that we have in the first quarter.","So we think that the margins are actually going to be a little bit higher through the balance of the year; mix always matters to that so if there was a larger proportion of first time closings that can move that a little bit, but I don\u2019t think it moves it much on the whole. I don\u2019t know Richard if do you want to\u2026","Richard J. Dugas","No, I think that\u2019s exactly right. I just wanted to \u2013 you already said it Bob, clarified that we were speaking to gross margins, not operating here.","Stephen S. Kim","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, so you\u2019re [indiscernible] incorporating very much mix in that, but you are assuming that you are going to see some lift from the abatement of the purchase accounting, that kind of stuff. Okay, my second question relates to a comment you made about land prices being up in 75% of the markets I think you indicated that your folks are telling you.","I was curious if you could give a little more color around that, is that a year-over-year comment, if so, how about sequentially, what are prices done in land because I think that you know land prices probably aren\u2019t that seasonal I would think, and which markets are you seeing that and I assume that\u2019s consistent with what you are buying also. So just some color around the land price comment.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","It certainly is year-over-year and certain degree \u2013 I mean its what folks are telling us they are seeing as they got negotiate land transaction, three quarters of the country our footprint in the country I would tell you is most of our markets and so I wouldn\u2019t want to call one out versus another.","I guess the point being really and we\u2019ve said it for a couple of years now land doesn\u2019t move quite as quickly down as it does up and there is I think again for the types of land parcels that we're interested in a competitive landscape. So we are working hard to make sure we buy in terms of that make sense and can support the returns that are \u2013 has set out as being requirements due to transaction and for those attracted parcels it\u2019s a competitive set.","Richard J. Dugas","And Bob I would just add that we clearly believe our land buying discipline is very, very helpful to returns its also one of the regions that our margins not only are among industry leader several 100 basis points higher than many in the space, but also the reason that we continue to guide for a more positive margin trajectory versus the industry and we believe at the land discipline serves as well. For it\u2019s not about a lot of unit volume although we are pleased with the volume performance it\u2019s about higher returns the combination of the appropriate volume and strong margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert C Wetenhall","Hey, good morning.","Richard J. Dugas","Hi, Bob.","Robert C Wetenhall","Good morning, just wanted to ask you in terms of ASP trends it seems like decelerating and I was trying to understand is just more a function of a mix shift or is it function that\u2019s you had really strong pricing gains in 2014, so the comps are tougher.","Richard J. Dugas","Bob, this is Richard. That\u2019s a great question, two things there. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the comps are little bit tougher, but we did have an unusually core mix of closings in Q1 relative to ASP and frankly we don\u2019t think we did it great job highlighting that last call. So the numbers were down pretty substantially simply do to mix. So as I indicated earlier one of the earlier questions we are pleased with pricing trends and you see that through premiums and options trends overall. So it\u2019s a little bit about but we did have a particular weak Q1 mix.","Robert C Wetenhall","Is that makes reverse then.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Hey, just would find point on that \u2013 think about the way the closing sequence works we are going get more closing from warm weather places which typically at lower ASP so its not mix by brands its really geography to drive that. If you look at our backlog you know ASP in the backlog is consistent year-over-year today. So March versus March and it actually up from December.","Robert C Wetenhall","Okay. So I am thinking you are saying that\u2019s going to reverse as we move forward correct or start to improve.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Right so that the backlog ASP today as I think 335 or $6000 versus the ASP that we actually printed at 323 in the first quarter. Again, geographic matters and were the closings are coming from.","Robert C Wetenhall","Got it, got it that\u2019s really helpful. And just a follow up you guys got out construction delays negative impacted deliveries. Some trying to think through that and Richard also mentioned the commentary about the difficult you permitting, which I think it lead to extension deliveries, from a timeframe standpoint. Does that me that some of the product you expected to bring online in 1Q actually is going to role in the second calendar quarter instead. So it sound like demand destruction so should we see benefit in 2Q as you are able to result construction delays no it just look in for little granularity what kind of delays you guys are mentioning in it sounds like a transitory problem is suppose to something recurring. Thanks.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Bob your are exactly right and its related to just being an able to get the homes close, no change in overall demand trends overall there we simply missed some units below our expectation in Q1 and most of that make up is going to be in Q3 and Q4. We will get about what we expected in Q2 but the make up unfortunately just given sort of the push and timing we are expecting the vast majority of that in the second half of the year. So it is transitory your timing issue having nothing to do with overall market demand.","Operator","Your next question Ivy Zelman from Zelman and Associates. Your line is open.","Ivy Zelman","Hey guys good morning.","Richard J. Dugas","Hi, Ivy.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Hi, Ivy.","Ivy Zelman","I understand on Centex product offering in terms of your 200 I think you get 208,000 average price with FHA available at pretty reasonable underwriting 580 if I go you talking about 3.5% down in the back end ratio at plus 50%. Richard you mentioned tight underwriting I guess what you think its tight about that and then secondly as you think about the impairment to extending the Centex brand and getting more absorption is it more impairment because your land doesn\u2019t pencil to the return or what actually happened because I don\u2019t think you are going to see anymore favorable underwriting to FHA right now [indiscernible] about it.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ivy we agree with you on that FHA is clearly accommodated for the Centex brand. It is more land underwriting criteria kind of to one of the earlier questions it\u2019s about pace coming back strongly enough to support the kind of returns we want. I will say we are optimistic with what we\u2019ve seen in Q1 and our markets are really watching that and the potential to invest further in that category I think is rising. One of the thing I know as Bob indicated earlier in the middle of studying this category in detail, we are actually breaking that study into two different portions.","One, we\u2019re calling the urban millennial buyer and the other we\u2019re calling sort of the suburban value buyer and we do think that both of those categories behave a little bit differently. But later this year we are going to have more color on what we believe drives those of course we are watching the market overall, so we're optimistic that we could see a change in our investment portfolio over time we have not yet and we are still seeing vast majority of our land transactions at Pulte, but yes we agree that FHA is accommodated for the inter-level buyer.","With regard to the comment around tight underwriting criteria however it is very, very clear that credit in our opinion is two types in general and we are also and we put in our prepared remarks don\u2019t think you are going to see much change in that regard, but that has to do with QM and QRM just being a very tight underwriting box overall and that\u2019s why we are making that comment.","Ivy Zelman","And I appreciate, thank you for that. On the tightness, can you be more specific because even within QM I think that the question is, is it really tight or is it just a self employed barrowers and for a national, what specific about QM would you say that\u2019s tight [indiscernible] 3% down, 6.25 go backend ratios. I think people when everybody talks about tight it\u2019s hard for us to understand what that really means?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ivy I think you are right the construct of the offering is good, it\u2019s the underwriting discursion or lack there I think we are talking about, so whether it\u2019s credit overlays or just an inability for the people who are underwriting loans to say I see a blemish and I understand it and I can document around it. People aren\u2019t really willing to do that yet and so the rep and warrant issue that has been sort of an overhanging the industry we believe still impacts loan generation. So that tightness we are talking about isn\u2019t around the product or how affordable it is or how accessible it is to a particular buyer group, it\u2019s really that \u2013 it\u2019s tough to get a mortgage approved.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Jack Micenko for SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko","Hi, good morning guys. Looking at the \u2013 the cadence of buyback so I think we are running what\u2019s call it 50 million in the first three quarter of last year and kind of stepped up to $100 million number through the first quarter. I am just thinking say systematic is because the question is systematic the 100 going forward or 50 how do we think about that on a go forward basis.","Richard J. Dugas","Hi, I think we haven\u2019t given any forward guidance on that and we look at candidly as we go through the year. I think the fact that we now done a couple of quarters that $100 million is indicative of what we are thinking for 2015. Because the only thing offer on top of that is as we look at our cash position and we look at our cash generation and what we are going to utilize our cash for we will adjust that over time. So as we for instance go through our reforecasting process each quarter here we look at what is our cash position. How much we are going to be investing in the business what we are getting need to run the business and obviously $1 billion in cash still higher than we would like to carry.","Jack Micenko","Heard I thanks.","Richard J. Dugas","Here just talk about that will use cash actually to likely pay down the debt that matures in the second quarter. Again we are looking at ways to trying utilize some of the cash.","Jack Micenko","Okay great. And then just to confirm there is no more go forward \u2013 impact in the gross margin.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes we work through the - with that we acquire which is what has really challenged margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thanks good morning guys. It like follow up on Jack question just a little bit. Associate with capital allocation in your ROI see target first on the ROI see do you all have target out there you are willing to share maybe or at least that progression of how you expect this is to go over the next few years and then given what\u2019s you all have been taking about seeing much higher land costs, probably not running \u2013 probably not getting out over year skews on community growth et cetera. Are you starting to is you cash allocation starting to the [indiscernible] starting to move away from reinvestment toward that that pay down and return to shareholders are you still where are you still pretty much in the same type of the mode if you will.","Richard J. Dugas","Stephen this is Richard. I would say a couple of things. We clearly intend and optimistic that we can drive returns higher in the coming years. We don\u2019t have a particular target out there other than that is crystal clear throughout the organization that our view is to our number one goal financial is to drive higher returns. With regard to allocation we are very consistent we go we said our December Investor Day our first priority is to invest in the business and we are pleased with getting our communities open and we\u2019re pleased with the ability we believe to hit our targeted committee count for the year. That\u2019s our number one goal.","Second is to continue to fund an increasing dividend, third is any opportunistic M&A and then residual cash on a very systematic basis back to shareholders. So that last one is going to fluctuate depending on our ability to invest in the business and as Bob indicated we stepped up here in the last couple of quarters. So we feel like we're doing exactly what we said we would we're very pleased with our performance we\u2019re pleased with the environment, we\u2019re pleased with the quarter we feel like we\u2019re doing exactly what we said we will be doing.","Stephen East","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","The only thing I would add to that Steve if you would focused on the debt repayment we got a maturity here in the second quarter I think it's $238 million not really a big enough bite for us to say let\u2019s refinance it so I think what we\u2019re looking at is we got cash we\u2019ll pay it down, we\u2019ve got a bigger maturity stack next year, it\u2019s little bit under $500 million. And so I think if you think us, you\u2019d see us looking at structuring leverage sometime over the next six to nine months \u2013 market conditions that were some activity this week that price pretty attractively. So the markets are still accommodative, so we will be looking at that over the next call it year, but for this maturity it just seems to us, we got the cash, we will use it and then be opportunistic and then we access after that.","Stephen East","Okay, yes, thanks. And then just one more time on Centex you did push it a little bit more you said you saw some better demand out there, is maybe if you could talk a little bit about that the demand which you are seeing and this Centex really become much more of a 216 and 217 type story versus later this year. And if I can squeeze one other, do you mind ranking on the cost you said land, labor and materials. I assume the pressure on the gross margin is in that order, but if you could clarify it.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, so from a Centex perspective Steven, we are pleased with what we\u2019ve seen I think it\u2019s a little too early to say whether it\u2019s a 16 or 17 story more than this year, we have some large communities that are absorbing nicely throughout Texas, throughout the Southeast and in the Midwest and number of markets so we're feeling good about that. And with regard to margins just you know one comment over there we feel like land pressure is definitely coming through.","But in terms of the comment that you are making we are very pleased with the margins you are right in the guidance range that we have they continue to be among the industry leaders, and we're guiding for flat to up margins from here. So we\u2019re very pleased with that there is a lot of commentary out there about margins down. But we are right where we want to be and we intend to stay at or near the industry leaders.","And then just one other thing on Centex just to be clear, we have not invested a lot in Centex over the past couple of years. So the likelihood of Centex continues to be a smaller portion of our deliveries in the coming quarters is still there and that\u2019s okay. It will take some time to invest in Centex in the current timeframe reported manifest itself and we are watching the markets clearly to see when that happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","Richard J. Dugas","Good morning Susan.","Susan Maklari","Can you talk a little bit about material cost and any trends that we should be expecting as we go though the year especially given the decline that we\u2019ve seen in some of the prices?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, we obviously keep tracking everybody else and the good news is that for the significant majority of our material input cost, we see either flatter even in some release as number gets talked about a lot of the packages are trending nicely maybe the one out layer that is concrete where we would see some price pressure. So all in all I think we had talked about coming into the year maybe 1% increase in pricing and we\u2019ve certainly see that or maybe even a little bit better I don\u2019t know I think it was backwards, but it\u2019s not working against us in a large sense so a positive results there.","Susan Maklari","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then in terms of the mortgage market there is some big changes that are coming later this year in this summer and August, can you just talk a little bit about how you are working with your lenders to just make sure that some of them \u2013 there maybe a potential forward of the short-term bump that we see from that the avoided?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, so [indiscernible] here talked about August first is the date goes live and there are lot of people and lot of companies working really hard on this. It\u2019s kind of a complete reboot of the documentation process and we don\u2019t use a lot of outside lenders obviously so our mortgage company has been diligently working on this for months since they announced it last year.","We feel good about our ability to serve under the new guidelines, so I would tell you it should be business as usual for the Pulte mortgage company. If you are looking for things that could happen the possibility exist that not everybody is going to get there because it is a big undertaking and so for instances if we got a consumer that\u2019s trading out of another home that has to sell their home, if their buyers lender isn\u2019t able to close. So you might see some ripple through the industry around that.","So I think we feel good about our ability to meet and serve under the new trader rules and regulations but this is a big deal. I've had a characterized me as it's more disruptive to the mortgage industry than the cumulative Dodd\u2013Frank impact. And think about all the Dodd\u2013Frank encompass so this is a big undertaking. I would read certain survey I don\u2019t know if there is a right or wrong that close to half of the mortgage then might not be ready to do this. So we are will be ready to land but it\u2019s a big undertaking.","Susan Maklari","Yes, okay that\u2019s great color thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thanks first question I want to ask was about SG&A. You mentioned the 160 to 165 range persisting, the typically with your closing rising as they year went on you would expecting other various components to drive a little bit higher. So how should we think about that the investments you mentioned the community turnover. Although going to decline at rate that with an offset closing is driven variable component of that because you mentioned obviously that your community is you are going to open 200 I think 60 is in the first quarter. So how should we think about all that?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, so if you look at the increase in our SG&A year-over-year about third of that increase we would contribute to community count opening. On top of that you\u2019ve got the other two thirds being for people that characterize of that way. Some of them are community oriented so its in relation to opening new communities and other are so we talked about we made investments in IT training quality and so I would I think you will heard to say over time is that hour SG&A spend is not as variable as many.","So this is something that we have pretty good visibility into the people and the processes that we are investing into improve and to enhance the value creation this is we have underway or largely going to be fixed going forward. So the people that we are hiring should work on the projects in IT that example to work on the training will be ongoing cost. And obviously we have pretty good visibility into our planned openings in the spend on community so we think we have pretty good inside to what\u2019s happening in 2015 going forward obviously depending on how many new communities we have we will give you some color into variability of that expense each year.","Nishu Sood","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question you mentioned Richard some weather effect in the first quarter on closing so I mentioned there would be a little bit of get back in the second question you mentioned Richard some weather effect in the first quarter on closing. So I mention that would be a little bit of give back in the second quarter, my question was around demand though was there any effect related to weather as you saw it and demand for the first quarter I guess in that context it might be helpful also if you any comments about April and whether is any snapback or rebound.","Richard J. Dugas","Just two comments there we did indicate we miss some closings in Q1 and you referenced and coming back in Q2 we have been clear on this call most of them are coming back in Q3 and Q4, just FYI. No there was no demand impact from weather in Q1, we are very pleased with demand it exceeded our expectations. We are pleased with the sales volume we had and we are also pleased with April. April appears to be unfolding at a normal seasonal rate which is a good selling month.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Will Randow","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Richard J. Dugas","Hi, Will.","Will Randow","On the number of homes in control near develop or developed lots. Can you talk about that\u2019s trended over the past 12 months and how that might impact community count going forward?","Richard J. Dugas","I would say I had hard time hear you actually well.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","I think he was asking what happened to control lots over the past several quarters and how that\u2019s going to impact community count side.","Richard J. Dugas","I think I can answer the first part. Community count we still feel very good about our ability to be between 600 and 620 for each of the fourth quarters this year. I think Bob has got a little commentary on control lots.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, our control lots have been [indiscernible] its relatively flat for the last couple of years when we have been replacing lots as we deliver them. We are up about 8,000 lots and in terms of \u2013 if you think about what\u2019s happening inside that we are working through some older Del Webb community and we saw our Del Webb community count drop a little bit and we\u2019re replacing and essentially with Pulte community, so you see that community count increased over the last several year. But again 8,000 lots in last 12 months. And I would characterize that as largely flat.","Will Randow","Thanks for that and just one follow-up with option revenues reaching 13% in the quarter what do you think that can go over the next year particularly as a mix of closing changes.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, will that\u2019s tough to put a number on candidly, we do track every single market and every single community and we still have an emphasis in that area. And I would say we still have some opportunity. I can\u2019t give you specific number. I will just tell you that it\u2019s crystal clear around the organization that we are doing our best to drive returns. And clearly option revenue and lot premium revenue help.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Mccanless from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","Jay Mccanless","Hi, good morning everyone. First question with the incentives going up on a year-over-year basis do you guys expect that to continue through the year?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","We are talking about this probably 18 months now Jay, we have gotten incentives down to I think the one point was made here 1.5% or 6% which might be the comp working year-over-year and we\u2019re at 2.1% last fourth quarter, we\u2019re 2.2% now running between $5000 and $7000 a unit, we are not seeing anything I think you heard Richard talk about the current sales environment, we are not seeing big increases in incentives. So our expectation, since we are not doing spec business is that you really see that material.","Jay Mccanless","Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have, thanks.","Richard J. Dugas","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning, thanks. Just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on this Centex comment to be better for us I just wanted to clarify you did say that absorptions were flat year-over-year in the quarter in Centex?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","No, I said they are up 8% Megan.","Megan McGrath","Up 8%, okay.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","They were flat for Web and Pulte.","Megan McGrath","Flat for Web and Pulte. Okay, and then could you talk about that a little bit more was there any sort of geography that you saw that tickup or whether really nationwide that you saw that incremental improvement?","Richard J. Dugas","Well, we don\u2019t have Centex communities in all of our markets from where we did we saw a pretty robust change. Texas was good, the Southeast was good and that where a lot of our Centex product is, so it wasn\u2019t isolated to anyone market. ","Megan McGrath","Great, and then could you just for clarification give your cancellation rates for the quarter.","Richard J. Dugas","11%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you, just on the material side where we have seen pretty dramatic drops in lumber and structural panels pricing in the last couple of months, what would that show up in your cost of goods sold, is that going to be six months from now or is it really third quarter, fourth quarter where you would potentially see the benefits of that?","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, typically you are going to see what we are contracting today we\u2019ll deliver in six months and so I think that\u2019s \u2013 and based on what we buy, we have kind of a trailing pricing grid. So you would see benefit for current sales I should say changes in commodity pricing.","Mark Weintraub","And then how much of an offset if any might the tightness in labor that you were talking about factor and relative to where your expectations are been, it does seem that materials maybe lower than you thought, but is labor potentially going to be an offset or do you have any view on that.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes that will be market-by-market candidly so in markets that are busier you are going to see more labor pressure, you know obviously we still, we are one of the biggest builders in every market we operate in. So we got leverage capability with our trade, but if there is a lot of activity out there, sometimes we have to pay to get them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","Thanks good morning. Let me just talk a little bit about Del Webb just wondering why you think the biggest impediment is to improve absorptions at Del Webb right now. I am little surprised given the demographics and the weather patterns and just a strength of Florida and some other markets, why you are not getting a little bit more improvement there, what\u2019s \u2013 can you guess a little more explanation with what you think going on at Del Webb.","Richard J. Dugas","Buck, again absorptions have been steadily increasing throughout the last couple of years there and they were flat this time. So we are not disappointed in Del Webb overall we did have quite a few communities absorption selling efforts that rolled off as Bob indicated. And we do have some coming in the future. So its very difficult to say not exactly sure what\u2019s happening in Del Webb collectively other than that, it continues to be a good performer we just didn\u2019t particularly see the outsized performance this quarter.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","And the pricing there is still strong, the margin generation and the ASPs that we are getting from that buyer group were \u2013 they are still healthy and if and when they start to buy more actively it would really be beneficial.","Richard J. Dugas","One other comment there Buck, in talking to some of the operators in some of our strong Del Webb committees we do limit lot sales quite a bit. We don\u2019t want to get too far out of our ability to produce and protect our ability to drive price forward and there is a number of communities where we had excellent performance that were holding the lines. So a little bit of this is self induced, just to ensure that we don\u2019t get say a backlog that\u2019s out of year as an example versus say six or seven months.","Buck Horne","All right, thanks. And I wanted to follow-up on Nishu\u2019s question a little bit on the SG&A because anyway we were getting with this question about your variable cost is on commission should be increasing as you have more closings in the back half of the year. The component you said about your community openings you are certainly planning on continue to open a few number of communities later this year. So I am trying to understand is implicitly are you forecasting that \u2013 the people cost you described are actually going down in the back half of the year to hit to that 160 to 165 number or people cost\u2026","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Buck you have to remember we actually run our commissions through margins. So cost of goods sold, so that\u2019s not a variable from SG&A.","Richard J. Dugas","So I think that's the difference between what you're asking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener","Good morning gentlemen.","Richard J. Dugas","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener","Looking at gross margin the interest that you are capitalizing is out about 80 bps year-over-year. And I am just wondering if you could give us kind of a view on structural elements in gross margin that you know about, so you are going to be doing about 23 gross margin this year, you know there is a tailwind of in 1Qs case 80 basis points from interest expenses is that what you would expected to be for the year.","And then could you maybe talk about other factors that, that\u2019s tailwind, could you kind of highlight with some of these factors are that you are kind of seeing or thinking about I mean are you saving more in commissions or commissions cost any more, is land, does that change as well as given the 1Q prices. Are you going to \u2013 I am sorry if I missed it but did you give a fiscal year ASP or year end ASP that you would be willing to guide us towards. Thank you very much.","Richard J. Dugas","Yes, Ken, we did not give any total year or forward looking ASP number, we are going to continue to get the interest benefit through the year with regard to margin and then you know all the other components collectively obviously add up to that 23 number, so component of price or component of cost et cetera, I don\u2019t know Bob do you have any more granularity that you want to share. ","Robert O'Shaughnessy","No, you know we don\u2019t give quarterly views on the interest but we talked about the fact that we\u2019d have 40 or 50 plus million dollar benefit this year in expense versus last year. And so you will see that come to the income statement and will vary by closings on a quarterly basis.","Kenneth R. Zener","I mean I guess one question I have and then a follow-up as you move towards the common plan which I think you guys have obviously highlighted a lot of the benefits there part of that being cost, is there a way that you could kind of quantify how much the adult is benefiting you guys in terms of vertical costs or something? ","Richard J. Dugas","Ken, this is Richard, there is so many moving parts there mix between costs between price, between all of those components, it\u2019s difficult to give an exact number. I\u2019ll just leave it with this, we are very, very pleased with our margin performance, we are at or near the top of the industry and we are very confident in our margin trajectory from here. I terms of exactly which components are driving the March performance it\u2019s up to put a hand alone given the quarter-to-quarter variability. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Jim Krapfel from Morningstar. Your line is open.","James Krapfel","Hi, good morning thanks for taking the question. As you mentioned challenging entitlement from early part of your remarks I am just curious to hear which markers are you seen us mostly, what you think the underlying drivers are for the more challenging entailment process and then what you expect, the course of this trend say over the next several years.","Robert O'Shaughnessy","Yes, Jim entitlements are incredibly difficult in every market, they tend to be a lot tougher on the cost and they are saying Texas as an example which is an easier entitlement market but the trend continues to elongate across the country and that\u2019s likely to continue. It\u2019s simply a combination of lack of folks at the municipality that are available to approve both zonings if you will as well as land development approvals along with the fact that municipalities in general are being conscious of smart growth and the hit rate for entitlement for new communities continues to be very, very challenging.","This is not a new story this is something that I think the industry has talked about a lot we\u2019ve talked about a lot, so again it\u2019s having some impact on our ability to get our communities open and get our land spent on time. So it\u2019s more of a transition problem in terms of timing and it is a big picture issue but I doubt the entitlement market ever gets better candidly.","James Krapfel","Thanks for that. And then second question, what were the commonly managed plans as a percent of closings this quarter, do you still expect that to get to 70% and if you could get all ballpark how much incremental margin you could get remaining from getting to more commonly managed plans holding other factors constant?","Robert O'Shaughnessy","We delivered 54% of our closings through commonly managed plans in the quarter and we feel very good about our ability to get to 70% in a timely that we indicated over the next 18 to 24 months.","End of Q&A","Operator","We have no further questions in the queue. I like to turn our call back over to our representer.","James P. Zeumer","Thanks Ryan. Thanks everybody for your time this morning.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead, sir.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's Conference Call to discuss our first quarter financial results for the period ended March 31, 2017. Joining me for today's call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today.","Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.","That said, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. As we closed out 2016, there was concern in and around the housing industry about the potential impact the rising interest rates would have on buyer demand heading into the 2017 spring selling season. With the first quarter complete, it is clear that higher rates have not dampened buyer interest. In fact, it looks like the housing recovery may be picking up steam.","There are several dynamics that continue to sustain and drive the housing recovery. On the demand side, gains in jobs combined with low interest rates are all working to drive consumer confidence higher. Coupled with the limited supply of new homes, we're experiencing a supply and demand environment that is favorable for housing. In particular, I would point to jobs, wages, and consumer confidence as being among the most important drivers of housing demand as they link a potential buyer's ability to buy a home with the confidence to do so. Overall, we believe these dynamics will continue to support an improving new home sales environment. And like most in the industry, we're encouraged by Q1 demand conditions and have high expectations for the remainder of 2017.","With this as a background on the current business environment, we're excited to discuss the company's first quarter operating and financial results. As was the trend for much of 2016, our Q1 results reflect a positive impact of our increased investments as we generated 14% growth on the top line and 17% growth in earnings per share. I'm pleased to say that consistent with our value creation focus, we've been able to grow our operations while continuing to deliver high returns on invested capital.","Bob will review the quarter in detail, but there are a few points that I want to touch on. First, our results continue to benefit from the increased investment in the business over the past several years that is allowing us to expand our community count and drive higher volumes and revenues.","Second, we reaffirm our expectations for full year gross margins. Although Q1 came in slightly lower than guidance, the difference was driven more by the geographic and buyer mix of homes ultimately closed in Q1 rather than a meaningful shift in pricing or cost dynamics.","Third, we updated our full year SG&A guidance and now project that it will improve by as much as 50 basis points versus previous guidance as we expect to realize improved overhead efficiencies. We announced that we took actions in Q3 of last year to materially reduce our SG&A expenses, and we're realizing the benefits of those actions.","And finally, our land investment for the quarter is consistent with the plans we outlined previously for 2017. This includes investing in shorter, faster turning projects as we target a long-term mix of owning three years of lots and optioning three years. Consistent with this focus, the average duration of projects approved in the quarter was approximately 2.5 years.","Let me touch on one final point before handing the call over to Bob. I have talked about the concept that over time there are opportunities for us to increase the penetration of the buyer groups we serve. While the resulting discussions tended to focus on the potential to increase our market share among first time millennial buyers, I would highlight that the boomer population is just as big as the millennials and they typically have much stronger financials and higher homeownership rates. This is obviously a buyer group that we know well and have served without rival under our Del Webb brand.","Through our legacy web communities, our new Del Webb offerings and our age-targeted Pulte, DiVosta and even Centex offerings, we see the potential to grow our active adult business going forward. In fact, our newest Del Webb in Nashville has experienced excellent demand despite not having formally grand-opened, and helped to support the strong active adult performance we realized in the quarter. With 75 million people in each of the huge book end generations of the millennials and boomers, we see opportunities to expand our scale among both of these demographics.","Now, let me turn the call to Bob.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our first quarter results have the company off to a strong start and position us to achieve the performance objectives we have set for the year. Sign-ups in the first quarter increased 8% to 6,126 home and were up 16% in dollars to $2.4 billion. Looking at our Q1 sign-ups by buyer group, first time was essentially flat compared with last year at 1,762 homes; move up gained 12% to 2,831 homes; and active adult increased 13% to 1,533 homes. The nice increase in active adult was driven in part by our new Del Webb in Nashville which, as Ryan noted, is receiving great buyer interest.","Our absorption pace for the quarter which was down 1% compared with last year was influenced by the timing of community openings and closeouts over the past 12 months. We had a number of high volume first time buyer communities operating in 2016 that ultimately sold out during the year and their replacements are just getting opened. In the case of active adult paces, our newest Del Webb had a positive impact in the quarter. Breaking absorption down by buyer group, first time and move up were both down 5% while active adult was up a robust 17%.","Consistent with recent trends, we continue to realize meaningful top line growth as Q1 home sale revenues increased by 14% to $1.6 billion. The higher revenues for the period were driven by a 6% or a $22,000 increase in average selling price to $375,000 combined with a 7% increase in closings to 4,225 homes.","Our Q1 closings by buyer group were 29% first time, 44% move up, and 27% active adult. This compares to 29% first time, 41% move up, and 30% active adult in the first quarter of last year. Based on the homes we currently have under construction, we expect a sequential increase in deliveries of roughly 15% to 20% resulting in second quarter closings in the range of 4,850 to 5,050 homes.","Our average sales price for the quarter increased 6% over last year to $375,000 driven by the ongoing shift in our business towards move up communities along with price increases realized within each buyer group. Looking at our ASPs by buyer group, first time was up 10% to $277,000, move up was up 4% to $444,000, and active adult was up 4% to $367,000. You may note that our first time ASP of $277,000 was down sequentially from the $301,000 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. That decrease primarily reflects a mix shift due to fewer California closings which carry much higher prices. Consistent with our guidance that we expect our average sales price to exceed $400,000 in 2017, our ASP and backlog is $408,000. This is up 6% compared to last year and is up from $396,000 in the fourth quarter, and is likely the first time our backlog ASP has exceeded $400,000.","Looking at margins, our reported first quarter gross margin was 23.2% which is down from last year. Our gross margins reflect the ongoing impact of anticipated land, labor, and materials cost increases. Margins in the quarter were also impacted by the mix of homes closed as we deliver fewer active adult homes which typically carry our highest gross margins.","In the quarter, we continue to have success in realizing higher lot premiums and option revenues. In fact, total option revenues and lot premiums increased 10% compared to last year to approximately $73,000 per closing. Sales discounts for the quarter totaled 3.3% or approximately $13,000 per home which represents a 70-basis point increase over Q1 of last year. Based on our current backlog as well as the mix of communities and related closings anticipated through the balance of the year, our full year gross margin guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect full year margins at the lower end of our guidance range of 24% to 24.5%. Consistent with our expectation for improving margins over the balance of the year, we expect a sequential gain of 30 to 60 basis points in our Q2 gross margin compared with our first quarter results.","Looking at our overheads, SG&A in the quarter was $236 million or 14.9% of home sale revenues. Compared with last year, this represents a decrease to our overhead in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. As noted in our press release this morning, SG&A for the quarter included an expense of approximately $15 million or almost a full percentage point of revenue resulting from the resolution of certain insurance matters. In the comparable prior year period, SG&A was $242 million or 17.4% of home sale revenues. With our reported SG&A, including the $15 million insurance charge being down $6 million and 250 basis points as a percentage of revenues, it's clear that the actions we took last year were successful in lowering cost and driving greater overhead leverage as we work to enhance our operating margin.","Given the success of actions taken to lower overheads, we now expect our full year SG&A in 2017 to be in the range of 12% to 12.5% of revenues compared with our previous guidance of 12.5% of revenues. As we are maintaining gross margin guidance, it points to our full year operating margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%.","Turning to our financial services businesses, we generated pre-tax income of $14 million in the quarter compared with $10 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in pre-tax was primarily the result of higher closing volumes in our homebuilding operations. Mortgage capture rate for the first quarter was 80% compared with 81% last year. In aggregate, we delivered pre-tax income of $139 million in the first quarter inclusive of the $15 million insurance charge which represents an increase of 18% over Q1 of 2016.","Income tax expense for the quarter was $48 million which represents an effective tax rate of 34.3%. Our tax rate was lower than previous guidance due to the new equity compensation accounting standard that requires us to record certain tax attributes related to stock compensation through the tax provision which in the past had been recorded directly to shareholders' equity. As the stock compensation-related tax attributes are tied to stock sales or option exercises by employees, it's difficult to estimate the impact of this standard on our future tax rate. As such, we still estimate our effective tax rate, excluding any impact from the standard, will be approximately 36.5% for the remainder of the year but our reported tax rate may vary due to the standard.","On the bottom line, net income for the first quarter was $92 million or $0.28 per share. Prior year net income was $83 million or $0.24 per share. Our Q1 2017 diluted earnings per share was calculated using approximately 320 million shares which is a decrease of 30 million shares or 9% from 2016 due primarily to share repurchase activities.","Switching over to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $424 million of cash after having used $100 million to repurchase 4.7 million common shares in the quarter at an average price of $21.30 per share. As we've discussed on our Q4 call, we expect to repurchase $1 billion of our shares in 2017 and that the timing of these repurchases will be driven in part by the normal seasonal cash flows of the business. Based on our quarter end cash balance and the expected near-term cash needs of the business, we anticipate the rate of our repurchase activity will increase in the second quarter. As always, our decision to repurchase shares is subject to overall business and financial market conditions. Given share repurchases completed in the quarter, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40% and we anticipate it will move slightly higher over the course of the year due to our repurchase activities. We do, however, expect that future earnings will move us back inside our targeted debt-to-cap range of 30% to 40%.","I'll close out my prepared remarks with a few data points on the strong performance of our homebuilding operations. We ended Q1 with 8,200 homes under construction which is an increase of approximately 4% over last year. The majority of the increase in our production relates to our sold backlog as, in total, specs represent only 25% of our homes in production which is down about 200 basis points from last year. And we continue to tightly control our finished spec inventory as we ended the quarter with only 600 finished spec homes or less than one per community.","Community count for the quarter increased 10% to 780. This was higher than we expected and was due in large part to a slower closeout of communities as opposed to an acceleration of our expected community openings. As a result, we still anticipate year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% for 2017.","Our land investment for the quarter totaled $566 million which is consistent with last year excluding the purchase of the John Wieland assets. Consistent with prior comments that land development will be a bigger percentage of this year's spend, Q1 land development was 57% of the total, up from 54% last year.","On the acquisition side, we continue to focus on smaller, faster turning projects resulting on our average deal size for the quarter being under 90 lots for the duration of roughly 2.5 years from the time we opened for sales. The transactions approved in the quarter were split roughly 60\/40 between move up and first time communities with a limited number of active adult lots.","We ended the quarter with 95,000 owned lots with another 42,000 lots controlled via option. Our owned lot supply continues to drop further below the five-year mark as we target a long-term goal of owning three years of land and controlling another three years through options.","In summary, and echoing some of Ryan's thoughts, we're pleased with the operating and financial performance we realized in the quarter. As important, I think our Q1 results put us in an excellent position to deliver another year of strong earnings growth and higher returns on invested capital.","Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan for some final comments on market conditions. Ryan?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. As I've talked about at the outset of this call, we have a positive view on the overall housing demand and believe that economic improvement, jobs, consumer confidence, and limited housing supply will continue to provide long-term support for new home sales. These factors along with favorable demographics will continue to work in our favor. While the potential for higher rates and any resulting impact on affordability must be watched, we are optimistic about buyer demand and overall supply dynamics going forward.","More specific to our first quarter, let me provide a few high-level comments. Starting out West, overall demand conditions were very strong and I would highlight Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico and Northern California as the areas of particularly strong buyer interest. Weather in California was an issue not so much in terms of hindering demand but it certainly created challenges with construction and land development. Similar to what we've experienced in Texas in prior years, we will be playing catch-up for a couple of quarters. We generally saw very good demand in the middle third of the country as buyers remained active within our Midwest and Texas operations. And finishing here in the East, demand conditions held up well in the quarter although we did see pockets of softness at higher price points in some of our markets. Through the first few weeks of Q2, we continue to experience strong buyer demand and good traffic into our communities. Combined with historically low interest rates, we have every reason to expect demand will remain strong through the remainder of the spring selling season.","Before opening the call to questions, I want to thank our employees who do an outstanding job every day of delivering a superior quality home and a great buying experience for our customers. You're the reason we've gotten off to a great start in 2017.","Now, let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Ryan. We will open the call for questions. So that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time in this call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Rochelle, if you explain the process we'll get started with the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Ryan, just wanted to ask you. The SG&A improvement was pretty dramatic during the quarter which speaks to a disciplined approach to operations. How much is left? And with the SG&A dollars you took out coming from existing markets that you're de-emphasizing, how much is left and how do we think about where the trajectory of SG&A goes from here?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the movement that we've made with a disciplined focus in dramatically reducing our SG&A expense. As far as the forward rate goes, what I would tell you is excluding commissions which we've now included in our SG&A line as I think everyone's well aware now, our SG&A will continue to slightly grow as we move throughout the year which is mostly driven by expenses associated with new community openings. As we talked about on our Q4 call, we expect to open about 250 new communities in 2017 so that'll have a little bit of an impact as we move throughout the year. But our expectation is that we'll continue to see favorable improvement on our overall SG&A spend.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good. You're making a ton of progress. I was just hoping for my second question. Maybe you could give us a little bit more regional color in terms of where you're seeing strength and weakness in markets? And kind of if you got, like, $50 or $60 stability in Texas for oil, how that market will look going forward? All your comments are very encouraging. It seems like you're aggressively managing demand to optimize return on capital by balancing pace and price. Do you see the same pace of demand persisting during the balance of the year and which markets will reflect that the most? Thanks and good luck.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Bob, that's a great question. I'll probably just reiterate some of the things that I shared in the prepared remarks which is really reflective of what we're seeing. We like the demand environment that we're seeing in California. The weather was certainly tough with a lot of rain that came in the first quarter. Didn't seem to impact demand but certainly will have an impact on our development timelines. We like what we're seeing in Arizona for certain. Texas remains a strong market for us. We also like what we've gotten out of the Midwest which has been a very strong performer. I also like what we're seeing in Florida.","When we look to the Northeast and the Southeast, good markets for us where we have some nice positions. We did see some pockets of softness especially in some of the higher price points.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And just one last thing. Thoughts on the lumber tariff relative to impact on profitability going forward? Obviously, kind of very recent development with today's news. Thank you.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Bob. I guess on the lumber tariffs, you've seen lumber prices move over the last 10 or 12 weeks. I think most people would suggest that's really been in anticipation of this. And I don't think that the announcement last night was any more significant; it might even be a little less significant than people were expecting. So volatility drives change and I'm not sure what will happen. But at this point it looks like the market has been expecting this so we don't expect anything dramatic from that. Obviously, how it plays out over time can have an influence on our cost structure","Operator","And next we'll hear from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to dive into the absorption pace data that you gave out before, and it was very helpful obviously. And you kind of alluded to timing of community closeouts influencing the sales pace decline year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense of, perhaps, how much that really did impact. I mean, was it a degree of magnitude, a couple of percent or was it essentially all of the decline? And even if, let's say, if the sales pace was flat and I'm thinking now more in terms of the first time segment, that's still kind of contrast, perhaps, to other builders that are seeing more demonstrable year-over-year increases in absorption rate. And I was just kind of curious in how do you think about that. Is it a mix issue for you guys or a positioning issue? Perhaps some of the stronger demand is in further out regions that maybe you're still not exposed to? So just any thoughts around that would be helpful.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Mike, it's Bob. Communities matter and as an example I'd use the fact that we posted really strong absorptions in the active adult side of the business which was impacted by the opening of the store in Tennessee that we talked about. Looking across the spectrum, if you look at the 5% down in the first time space, last year we had a number of communities that were generating really significant paces, that their replacements are either opening now or already have but we haven't seen the same paces out of them. You can cut this data 1 million different ways. If you look at the lower price points, those were typically that higher price point of the first time. We actually saw absorptions increase within that. So the mix of the communities we have opened at points in time contributes to the relative absorption pace.","In terms of the move up space, you heard Ryan talk about that at the higher price points and this might be because consumers have more choice. There's more product on the ground or they're just taking a little bit longer to make decisions. So we think that contributed to the decrease in the move up space. We still feel good about the business. The margins are still good there; we just haven't seen the absorptions increase from where they were.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Mike, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. The other thing that I'd maybe share with you is we were very pleased with our Q1 sign-ups and, frankly, they were very much in line with our internal plan. I know you don't have visibility to that, but we were pleased with the results. When we look at comparing our results to our competitors, there's so many variables out there that do make it difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison.","The other thing that kind of plays into that is the different approaches that everybody's taking with their different strategies as that relates to the buyer groups that we serve. As an example, I'd tell you you get a very different outcome if new community openings are skewed more toward first time buyers versus move up buyers. So that also kind of played into the results that we posted in Q1.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Ryan. That's helpful additional color as well. I guess just moving on the second question on the gross margins. You reiterated, I believe, your full year guidance and still expecting it to come in at the lower end of the range but maintaining that range. I was just curious in terms of, perhaps, so far this year you're almost four months done and a couple of months \u2013 two, three months \u2013 into the critical selling season. How would you view kind of upside or downside pressures to that gross margin guidance at this point in the year? I mean, Bob mentioned the lumber and you kind of feel like that's maybe baked into the market. But given how pricing is starting to shape up and a lot of balance of the year kind of maybe takes its queue from the selling season, how do you kind of ascertain upside and downside pressures to that gross margin guidance as you see it today?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Well, Mike, what we offer in terms of guidance is based on our backlog, so obviously we have a pretty significant backlog for the balance of the year. We're looking at margins on recent sales and we also think about the communities that we have coming online. So we're of the view that we can continue to deliver higher margins and we do expect improvement over the balance of the year.","In terms of the variability against that, I think a lot of it will depend on consumer confidence. We think that's a primary driver of sort of the demand equation. Obviously, local decision-making, what communities are next to you, what are your competitors doing, can influence local decisions. But, broadly, we think that consumer confidence and obviously interest rates, we've got the specter of rising rates but it hasn't happened yet. So how people feel will probably be the driver of what happens on a relative basis, the margins between now and the end of the year.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Mike, and the only thing I'd add to that and Bob's kind of alluded to it, but I think when you look at the overall supply and demand dynamics that we're dealing with right now, it's favorable. There's not a lot of supply out there and demand is reasonably high given an improving economy and some good job growth and high consumer confidence. And so there's a lot of variability as Bob talked about, that we've got to pay attention to lumber and labor and other commodities. But on the whole, combined with what's out there in a broader economy along with the mix of communities, and this is \u2013 I hate to say mix again \u2013 but when you look at the communities that we know we have coming online and what the profile is, we like the guidance that we've provided for the balance of the year.","Operator","And next we'll move to Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Just want to come back to the order number and make sure I'm understanding the comments you're laying out. I mean, a lot of folks are going to look at the 8% deceleration from the 15% to 17% you had in the second half of last year, also somewhat especially relative to peers at odds with their comments about the strong spring selling season. Now, is the main driver of that the shifting of the closing out of these high-volume communities? And if so, I heard a couple of different things about the replacements for those, that they will be coming on in 2Q which would imply that you could see some reacceleration in the absorption of order growth rate. But then I also heard that they may not have the same absorption pace. So how should we think about that? Is this just a temporary dip in the order rate do you expect with the strong demand reacceleration later on this year?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Nishu, there's a lot in there in the question but I think the best guidance that we can provide for you is that our absorption rate growth will be driven by our community count growth. We provided guidance that we'll be in the 5% to 10% range. We're executing against that. We ended the quarter at the higher end of that range given the slower closeout. So that's the direction that I would point you. Couple that with the things that Bob shared with you about some very high volume communities that we had in the first quarter of 2016 and as those replacements are just getting opened, I think that also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter comparison discrepancy that you're referring to.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. And also thinking about the margins, the strong demand that we've seen so far, this certainly surprised a lot of people as you mentioned despite the increase in interest rates. Is it translating to pricing power? From some of your peers we've heard comments more along the lines of we need to max out absorptions and that's how the demand will be captured. Given that your absorptions are coming in more flattish, I know you mentioned some of the factors, but just broadly is this environment conducive for pricing power especially since rates have dipped back down again though?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","I think that is going to be market-specific. Certainly, where you've got strong demand you have the opportunity to work on price. I think we're trying to offset cost increases. But you've got a different, I think, dynamic at different price points, and so were you at the lower price points where you're seeing more volume you might have more opportunity for price rather than at the higher price points.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","And, Nishu, to your question about pace versus price, I would tell you that's something that we pay a lot of attention to as our stated goal is we're driving the highest and best returns that we possibly can on a community-by-community basis. Sometimes that's the volume lever, sometimes just a price lever and we work to optimize that in every single community.","Operator","And next we'll move to Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up, I guess, first with the comment about lumber prices. If you could just give us a sense for kind of a rule of thumb what we should be thinking about in terms of the leverage to your margins if we see, let's say, a 10% increase in lumber cost year-over-year. On balance, I usually think of lumber being somewhere in the vicinity of high single digits to very low double digits of revenues. But I was curious as to what you would give us as a guidance rubric for titrating the effect of lumber prices to your margins.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","I think where you are, Stephen, in terms of as a percentage of lumber cost as a percentage of revenue, high single digits for the lumber package in total is probably not that far off but I think you also then have to split it though between your sticks versus your OSB because I'm pretty sure when you get into the high single digits you're probably including OSB as part of that package.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah, fair. Okay. Great. And then obviously a lot of things we could talk about this quarter and you talk about the environment being strong, and certainly we see that and there's a degree to which a rising tide benefits everybody. At the same time though, your commentary about your slower sell out of communities, I couldn't help but noticing that that was similar language to what you had said in the fourth quarter. And so I guess the essence of my question is given the fact that there has been a fair amount of change at the company from a management perspective and a board level, it wouldn't surprise me if you all were in the process of sort of overhauling some of your processes, the way you analyze things and so forth. And I'm curious as to whether or not any of this in your estimation is manifesting itself at the grassroots level in your sales data and whether we should view this as sort of a transition period because I don't think you've articulated in that way unless I've missed it. But I was curious as to whether you think any of that is at work in what we're seeing here and it's sort of a temporary issue in nature.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","No, Stephen, I don't think that's the case at all. We're just turning over a lot of communities. We turn over, on average, 250 to 275 communities a year. So with the churn of those closing out and the new ones opening up, sometimes you've got a few straggler sign-ups that may linger a quarter longer than we would've originally anticipated.","Operator","And next we'll move to Mike Dahl with Barclays.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, just a follow-up on that last question and comment. In terms of the slower than expected closeouts, is there any geographic concentration or price point concentration that you can speak to on those delayed closeouts and is there a specific action plan in place for those communities?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Mike, we manage all of that at our local level and our local operations teams are incredibly skilled at managing the closeout of those communities and making those decisions. We're not managing to an exact community count number; that's just simply not the way that we run the business. I mentioned they may sign-up or two, may hang on an extra quarter. And not to get too far into the weeds, but the convention that we use to count whether or not a community is open is if it has activity in the quarter. So you could've had something, for example, a closeout in January and it's done but it would've been reported as an active community in the quarter. So it's not anything that we're concerned about frankly.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I think that point is helpful because convention is different across builders. So thanks for that clarification.","And then shifting to some of the comments around active adult and the community opening in Nashville. So I gather this is one of the newer vintages of the Del Webb community which looks quite a bit different than the legacy ones. Can you speak to of what you think has been the kind of the attributes that have accreted for a successful launch so far and whether or not you have similar community openings scheduled for the balance of the year on the Del Webb side and where those will be?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Mike, that's a great question. I would tell you that the attractive attributes of this particular Del Webb community are the same as the prior Del Webb communities that have very attractive lifestyle components that we know Del Webb buyers enjoy. And as much as we're selling a house, we're selling a lifestyle and that's really what that brand has been centered around for a long, long time. This particular community is one of our newer vintage communities of course that is a little smaller in nature, that doesn't have as much capital investment, they're a little faster turning. They also happen to be a little closer in to the city center, the restaurants, and some of the other infrastructure that those active adult buyers are looking for. So we're very optimistic and encouraged by the early demand that we've seen. It is still early. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we haven't formally grand-opened yet but early returns are positive.","Operator","And next we'll move to Stephen East with Wells Fargo.","Paul Przybylski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","This is Paul Przybylski actually on for Stephen. First, I guess a question with your strategy for pricing. You mentioned earlier that we had the specter of rates moving higher this year. With respect to entry level, do you keep those prices flat or raise them with the risk of shrinking that buyer pool as we move through the year?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Paul, it is a community-by-community decision that we make with respect to pace and price and we under-write returns as I think we've shared with many of the folks often, and both elements are equally important. And so it's tough to paint it with a broad brush and tell you that one is more important than the other and that we're using one more often than the other.","Paul Przybylski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then how was the order cadence in the quarter and do you think you're continuing to see any pull forward and demand from the rate increase last year?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Paul, as I mentioned on maybe one of the earlier questions, as we looked at the order rate that came in through the first quarter of the year, we're very pleased with it. It was very much in line with our expectations and the way that we had kind of built our business plan for the year","Paul Przybylski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we move to Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and nice job on the SG&A leverage. Ryan, my first question, I wanted to dig into active adult as well. You sounded pretty bullish on the future of active adult and, obviously, with the size of the buyer pool equaling the millennials probably is a little bit under-focused on by investors. But at the same time, we have seen several builders either start a new active adult line or make an effort or commentary of expanding into active adult, and you guys are just kind of switching your focus there and away from the kind of the cruise liner Del Webb communities as you've called them to more smaller product, maybe with amenities but not as highly amenitized as the legacy communities.","So as you look at the landscape today in active adult, and I have a follow-up just on the trends you're seeing from a demand perspective, but how do you view Del Webb today from a competitive landscape versus some of these other builders that have either recently entered active adult or are looking to expand their exposure there?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Alan. Thanks for the question. We are bullish on the Del Webb brand and have been for a long time. It's a big part of our company, it's a big part of what makes us unique and different, and that's a story that we've been telling for a long time. As far as these newer vintage communities, they're still quite large. They're still in the neighborhood of 500 to 1,000 lots, just substantially smaller than the 7,500-lot communities with multiple golf courses that we did under the kind of the cruise liner Del Webb days. But still quite large communities that will provide several years of strong absorptions and create a nice sense of community within those individual locations.","When you look at the competitive landscape, we're not surprised at all that there are a lot of competitors that are seeing this as a big opportunity. There's 75 million buyers in that demographic. They're the wealthiest generation. They've arguably got the most liquid balance sheets, high homeowner ship rates, and they've got flexibility to kind of go and do the things that they want to do as they move into their retirement ages. The other piece that I think is important to think about is demographics here matter. And one of the things that we think we have working in our favor, as the millennials are beginning to reach age, as we see the peak of the millennial generation hitting the age 30 in the year 2020, they're starting to move on and buy their own homes as is demonstrated in some of the first time buyer numbers that are being reported.","Well, the millennials are the children of the boomers and that's also freeing up the boomers to do some of the things that maybe they have put off doing as they've tried to get their millennial kids out of the nest. So we like the competitive position we have, we like the capability that we've spent several decades building inside of our organization, and we think we're positioned as well as anybody to compete in that segment.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","That's helpful, Ryan. Thank you.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","One other thing, Alan, that I'd maybe just add, that I failed to mention, is we're doing a significant amount or we're expanding our thinking to include something beyond just Del Webb as it relates to that boomer demographic. There is a significant piece of that boomer demographic that's not interested in age-restricted but they are interested in downsizing and living a different type of lifestyle as they retire.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. I appreciate that, Ryan. And then just on the demand side from these buyers. You mention the flexibility and, of course, as the millennials move out from their basements that should free them up to move on to the next stages of their lives. But as we look at existing inventories where all these buyers have a home to sell, inventories continue to drop. They're among the lowest levels on record which would suggest, at least for the time being, they haven't moved forward with actually listing their homes on the market for sale. Now, understanding that most of these buyers are probably buying to-be-built homes from you, so maybe they wait to actually list their homes, can you give us any data maybe on traffic trends, or just anecdotal if you have that, just that would suggest that we should expect to start to see those wheels get set in motion going forward or is this, at this point, more of a kind of a view of what could happen or should happen based on the demographics? Thank you.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Alan. It's a good question. I think the best thing that I can probably provide for you is just a comment on what we saw overall within the quarter. We were very pleased with the traffic, very pleased with buyer interest and buyer demand and that really applied across all consumer groups that we serve.","Operator","And next we'll move to Jack Micenko with SIG Investment.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. Good morning. On slide six in the presentation, you talked about shortening the duration of your projects, I think, two and a half years. Obviously the Del Webbs, there's some longer tail communities in there and that sort of thing. Wondering if you could give us some context around where that's gone to and from, say I don't know, two or three years ago and how recent of a shift on that timeline is that? Is that something that's been in the works for some time or is that something more tied to, Ryan, your leadership? Just give us a sense of how that's kind of migrated over time?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, Jack. This is a big tanker and it takes a little while for actions to take place. This really goes back to 2011 for all intents and purposes. So the value creation initiatives that got started then were focused on less land, not necessarily the three years owned, three years option that Ryan's outlined, that we're moving towards. But if you look over the last four or five years, the profile of the land that we've been buying has been much shorter in duration. We mentioned that we're two and a half years in the most recent quarter. It's not much different than that over the last couple of years before. So our owned lot position down below five years today was up in excess of eight years several years ago, and I think you'll continue to see that move down as we continue to cycle through these shorter positions and work off some of those longer positions that you talked about. That takes a little while but we're very pleased actually with the tenure of the land that we've been buying now over the last few years and expect to be able to do more of that over time.","We're looking at options even in the Del Webb brand. We're trying to be capital-efficient. So I think we've talked about this, but there's a longer-dated community that we've gotten involved in in South Carolina. We think we'll be there for 10 years but we're buying the land on time, and so we think we could be really capital-efficient with that land as well.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then, Bob, since we have you, so the buyback cadence was lighter this quarter. Obviously, cash flows in your business change from quarter-to quarter. I know you acknowledge that \u2013 I guess the question here, the $1 billion this year is that still committed to and would that still get in the model?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. Certainly. I mean, with the usual caveat of subject to market conditions, we are planning to buy back $1 billion of stock this year. Yes.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll move to Joel Locker with FBN Securities.","Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Just digging down into SG&A a little bit. What was the commission for the first quarter I guess first of all?","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","3.5%.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Roughly 3.5%.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Sorry, I thought you were asking in dollars. I don't know that off the top of my head.","Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.","So if you take the $55 million and the $15 million charge, is it safe to say your base rate for SG&A is $166 million and growing? Is that a good way to look at it from our perspective?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","I think what Ryan talked about earlier, I think, is the right way to think about this. Our SG&A spend is truly variable on the sales commissions, but it is also variable based on new community openings. We've got start-up expenses. And so what we've tried to give you is a target run rate for the year. We had given you 12.5% coming into the year. We think we can do a little bit better than that, and so we've widened that out to 12% to 12.5%.","Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.","12.5%. And was there anything else besides the $15 million that made it lighter? Like, if you don't actually do the math and you have $166 million outside of the charge and the commissions, was there anything else that you're maybe trying or that you see coming or increases you see in the second quarter based on new community openings that haven't been expensed yet?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah, and that's what I alluded to in one of the earlier questions and Bob just kind of touched on it, Joel. We have 250 new communities that are opening throughout the year. We expense a significant amount of the new opening costs or the costs associated with those new openings in the quarter that those communities open. So in addition to the other variable components as new communities come online, that's the other variable number that will be added to our SG&A run rate on a go forward basis.","Joel T. Locker - FBN Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And next we'll move on to John Lovallo with Bank of America.","Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, guys. It's actually Pete Galbo on for John. Thanks for taking the questions.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Pete.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Pete.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Good morning.","Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Just a first one on SG&A. Bob, the total dollar amount being lower year-over-year and given some of the cost takeout that you mentioned from 3Q, can you just kind of dimension some of those cost takeouts for us that you kind of saw in the quarter and how to think about that on a run rate for the rest of the year?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","I think it was, really, it's people. And I don't mean to be insensitive, but we took a pretty big swing at people and I think we've talked about this in the past. It was largely focused on the corporate office. The reason being, and I think Ryan has used this analogy and I think it's perfect, as we were going through the initiatives of value creation over time, we were trying to fix the cars that was on the road or a building that we're ready to build so we put scaffolding up around it. We essentially, as most of those skill sets and processes and data analytics has been moved out to the field operations, thought that we had an opportunity to take down that scaffolding. So it's the people that we've taken out of the organization that really influenced that.","Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. No, that's helpful. And I know there's been a lot of questions around active adult here, and I think Ryan maybe touched on this briefly. But within that 17% absorption growth that you saw within active adult, is there a way to break out what percentage or factor that was the Del Webb portion versus the age-targeted but non-age-restricted piece that you guys have mentioned in the past?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","The majority of it was Del Webb. I don't have a specific percentage, but I'd point you to the majority of it being Del Webb. We are making new investments that are going to this non-Del Webb age-targeted but those are openings that will come in future periods.","Peter Thomas Galbo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Pete.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Buck Horne with Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the comment about the repurchase program and potential market conditions. Could you elaborate on what may be some potential triggers or other thresholds that you would look at in terms of something that may reduce the targeted spend of $1 billion dollars this year?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Buck, it's Ryan. I think the biggest message that I'd want you to hear is that we're committed to the $1 billion buyback. Bob mentioned in his prepared script that we're taking into consideration the cash needs of the business. We ended the first quarter with $450-ish million in cash, so we really like our cash position. As we look at the balance of the year, we certainly anticipate ramping up that spend amount as we move into the second quarter. We probably don't have enough time on this call to list all of the potential things that could go wrong with the world economy that would influence that. I think the best bet is to go with the plan that we're buying $1 billion back.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And going to another just kind of a operating strategy thing. With demand strengthening and the spring selling season off to a good start, would it be a thought to strategically increase the production of unsold spec units even further to meet some of that demand? Is that something you would consider, and obviously that comes with balancing some of the risks of spec production? Just looking for some thoughts on that subject. And also if you've got the cancellation rate in the quarter, that'd be great.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","So, Buck, I'll speak to the spec start question first. About 18 months or so ago we did introduce an incremental additional amount of specs into our production pipeline. We like where we're running right now. As far as would we introduce more, we would introduce more in an effort to balance out our production pipeline to ensure that we can maintain a consistent and predictable cadence of production for our trades. We want to give nice stability and visibility to our trade partners so that we can keep them on our job site. We think that's one of the, probably, best and strongest tools that we have to maintain a predictable production pipeline. So our strategy is different than some of our other competitors that run at a higher spec rate. We believe that given our strategy and our focus on driving better returns on invested capital, the rate that we're running at is about right.","And then to your question on the cancellation rate in the quarter, it was just over 12%.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Buck.","Operator","And we'll move on to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the new Del Webb community here. It's a good looking community and I know it's been a long time coming for you guys. The first question I had with the community count and the closeouts maybe going slower than what you'd anticipated, should we think about gross margins in 2Q being at the lower end? I think you said 30 to 60-basis point improvement sequentially. Should we trim or think more about it being closer to 30 than 60?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","It's hard to answer that question with specificity. A lot of it's going to depend on when and where closings come in. We offer the range without a bias towards higher or lower within it.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. The second question I had, and I apologize if I missed this, did you all give any guidance for SG&A and where it should trend for 2Q?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Jay, we did not give it specific to Q2. What we have given is a full year range of 12% to 12.5% which is a 50-basis point improvement over the prior guidance that we had given of 12.5%. So I think as you're modeling it, you're building your models, look to our community count guidance that I'm sure you'll use to model your volume and that'll help give you a kind of a guidance of where overheads will run. As Bob mentioned and some of the other commentary that we provided, we're incredibly pleased with the movement that we've made on SG&A. We do anticipate it increasing slightly as we move through the year on the non-variable components. As we open up our new communities, there is spend that's associated with getting those new communities open.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","James P. Zeumer - PulteGroup, Inc.","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","And we'll move on to Ken Zener with Keybanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Hey, Ken.","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So I have a kind of a simple question. There was obviously a lot of enthusiasm communicated by builders, and today people might've thought your orders fell short. We look at it a little differently which is that your seasonal pace rose 40% which is actually your long-term average over 18 years, so I think you're doing well there. Is there anything \u2013 if I just flip it around, your community count growth, it was a lot, if it impacted the comments you made. Is there any reason to assume seasonality is not going to persist into the next quarter? Is there something dramatically different that we saw about March trends?","Ryan R. Marshall - PulteGroup, Inc.","Ken, this is Ryan, and I'd answer it as a simple no. The seasonal trends that played out in the first quarter were very much in line with our expectations.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Excellent. And then my next question. Since you brought up spec, do you guys comment on or disclose your total units under construction which would be, obviously, your backlog, true spec, and then model homes so we could get a sense of the conversion of those total units in your closings?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - PulteGroup, Inc.","Yeah. We've got 8,206 units under construction at March 31.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And that's backlog...?","Ryan R.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer session.","Thank you. Mr. James Zeumer, you may begin your conference.","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Great, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone participating today. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's conference call to discuss our second quarter financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Joining me for today's call are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President, CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Vice President, Finance and Controller.","A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroupinc.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later today. Before we begin the discussion, I want to alert all the participants that today's presentation may include forward-looking statements about PulteGroup's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual reports and quarterly reports.","That said, let me turn the call over to Richard Dugas. Richard?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. For those of you who have been following PulteGroup for the past few years, you have repeatedly heard us use terms such as balance, discipline and return-driven, which are all supportive of the value creation strategy we have been pursuing since 2011. Consistent with this focus, let me highlight a few numbers. We have purposefully increased our land spend over the past 24-plus months, allowing us to grow our community county and land pipeline over the period, while actually owning fewer lots, but controlling more positions via options.","We remain disciplined in our pursuit of land. Yet, our land acquisition and development spend for the first six months grew by 30% or roughly $200 million over the prior year. The increased investments we make now are intended to support an expanded business in the future. We've focused on investing in superior land positions, which, coupled with the slow, but steady housing recovery, helped drive an 11% increase in our second quarter order value, our highest quarterly value in eight years. We have also been consistent in our emphasis on maximizing margin opportunity on the homes we sell as demonstrated by our second quarter gross margin of 23.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the first quarter. Our gross margins continue to rank among the highest in the industry, which is a dramatic improvement from just a few years ago.","And finally, we paid down $238 million of debt in the second quarter, while also returning almost $0.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and stepped up share repurchase activity in the quarter. I know we have made this point before, but in the past, we likely would have driven every dollar back into new land even if it meant reaching for deals or potentially taking on additional risk. Under today's more disciplined approach, we look first to invest appropriately in the business and then to return excess funds to our shareholders. When we started our value creation journey in 2011, we talked a lot about being more disciplined in how we ran the business and including share repurchases and in increasing dividend in our allocation of capital.","We also talked about the need to focus on key operating and financial metrics such as gross margin, overhead leverage, inventory turns and return on invested capital. I'm very pleased to say that the numbers I highlighted and others that Bob will discuss shortly demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts and that we remain clearly on track with our value creation strategy.","The final numbers I want to highlight relate to our backlog which, at almost 9,000 homes, valued at $3.1 billion is our highest in the past eight years. Such a large pipeline of sold homes affords us a lot of production visibility and stability as we look to the second half of 2015. Picking up on comments that I made in our last earnings call, broadly speaking, I would say the improvement in housing demand that we noted in the fourth quarter of 2014 continued through the entire spring selling season of 2015. Our experience aligns with government data, that while always subject to revision, shows that new home sales on a non-seasonally adjusted basis are up every month of 2015 over the comparable prior-year period.","While dynamics ranging from potential Federal Reserve actions to uncertainty around global events are helping to create significant volatility in the financial markets, the key underpinnings of a housing recovery remained very supportive of future strength. First, the U.S. economy continues to expand at a modest rate, enabling the country to generate in excess of 200,000 jobs per month, without triggering inflation fears. Second, interest rates are still historically low. And while they have started to move higher, they are still very supportive of homebuying, especially as compared to ever-increasing rental rates, and finally, demographics are aligned to support sustained housing demand with the large boomer population at one end and the even larger millennial segment at the other. Recent data suggests that millennials are getting more active in the market. According to the National Association of Realtors, the percentage of first-time buyers rose to 30% in June.","In contrast, a year ago, first-time represented 28% of all buyers. While still below the 40% to 45% expected in a typical recovery, first-time demand is showing more consistent signs of improvement. Overall, we continue to see positive market trends and believe we are still in the early stages to mid stages of a sustained recovery in U.S. housing. In addition, we believe PulteGroup is extremely well positioned to capitalize on the market conditions. Our goals remain consistent: to deliver exceptional operating and financial results, return funds routinely and systematically to shareholders, and to deliver an unmatched experience to our homebuyers.","Now let me turn over the call to the Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. PulteGroup's homebuilding revenue for the second quarter totaled $1.2 billion, which is comparable with prior-year results. Second quarter revenues reflect a 1% or $3,800 increase in average selling price to $332,000, which was essentially offset by a 1% decrease in closings to 3,744 homes. The 1% increase in average selling price for the quarter was driven by a 6% increase in our average Centex prices to $214,000, along with a 2% increase in Del Webb to $332,000. The average selling price for our Pulte brand was down 1% to $391,000. The decrease of second quarter ASP for Pulte primarily reflects a mix shift driven in part by last year's acquisition of certain homebuilding assets of Dominion Homes in Columbus and Louisville.","In the second quarter, the closing percentages by brand were as follows: 24% were Centex, 48% were Pulte and 28% were Del Webb. This compares with 23%, 45% and 32% respectively in the second quarter of last year. As we've discussed over the past few years, two-thirds or more of our land investment has been going towards Pulte communities because that's where we're seeing the best returns on invested capital. The overweighting into Pulte communities continues to drive a shift in the mix of the homes we're delivering.","Gross margin for our second quarter was 23.3%, which is a sequential increase of 60 basis points from Q1 of this year and is down 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. Allowing for typical quarter-to-quarter variability, we expect our third quarter and fourth quarter gross margins to be comparable to the 23.3% delivered in Q2. Based on these expectations, we anticipate that our full-year gross margin will exceed our previous guidance of 23%.","The Q2 trends and option revenues and lot premiums were comparable to what we experienced in Q1 of this year. For the second quarter, option revenues per closing increased 9% or $4,400 over last year, while lot premiums gained 5% or $600. Sales discounts this quarter totaled 2.2% per home, which is up about 50 basis points from last year, but consistent with our preceding two quarters.","As a result of changes to certain accounting estimates recorded in the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, SG&A for the periods was not directly comparable. Reported SG&A in the second quarter of 2015 was $130 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues. SG&A in Q2 2015 included a $27 million benefit resulting from a legal settlement. Excluding the impact of this settlement, SG&A was consistent with our guidance for quarterly expenditures in the range of $160 million to $165 million. Reported SG&A in the second quarter of last year was $230 million, which included $88 million in charges for insurance reserves and office relocation costs. Financial services second quarter pre-tax income was $10 million, up slightly from $9 million in the prior year. Our mortgage capture rate for the quarter increased to 83%, up from 80% last year.","Closing out a review of the income statement, the effective tax rate was 38%, which is consistent with our previous guidance, resulting in second quarter net income of $103 million, or $0.28 per share. EPS for the quarter was calculated on approximately 364 million shares outstanding, which is down 4% from last year, resulting largely from share repurchase activities.","Moving onto our homebuilding operations. At the end of the second quarter, the company had 6,779 homes under construction, of which 17% were spec. Our finished spec inventory at quarter end was only 314 homes, which remains well below one finished spec per community. We continue to emphasize a build-to-order model for our operations, but we may elect to put a limited number of spec homes into production in certain communities to help reduce seasonality in our projection in the future. While the number of spec units involved will be modest, we believe a more even production cadence has the potential to yield construction efficiencies and can help reduce some of the volatility in quarter-to-quarter closing volumes.","On the land side, we approved approximately 4,800 lots for purchase and ended Q2 with 136,000 lots under control. In total, 40,000, or 30% of our lot position are controlled through options, which compares to 10% at the end of 2010 when we launched our value creation initiatives and reflects the progress we've made in our efforts to manage our land risks and drive higher returns on invested capital. Of our controlled lots, approximately 23% are developed.","In the second quarter, we spent $444 million on land and related development, of which 58% was for development of existing positions and 42% for was acquisition. For the first six months of this year, our total land spend was $929 million. We're anticipating that our land investment activities will accelerate in the second half of 2015, although we are likely to slightly under-spend the $2.4 billion full-year authorization we noted at the beginning of the year. A competitive land market, development delays and longer entitlement timelines on a number of projects means some deals have slipped and some may have been postponed or delayed indefinitely.","As we've said previously, we won't force investment into the system. While our $2.4 billion authorization remains in place, we now expect that our 2015 land investments will be closer to $2.3 billion. This would represent an increase of almost 30% over last year's land spend and is consistent with our view that the housing recovery will continue for at least several more years.","In addition to investing in the business during the quarter, we also repurchased 10.7 million shares of PulteGroup stock for $213 million, or $19.90 per share. This level of activity has roughly doubled recent quarters and is consistent with our commitment to the return of capital to our shareholders. We also used available capital to retire $238 million of senior notes that matured in the second quarter. Given the reduction in both our debt and equity positions, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 26% and a cash position of $478 million.","Second quarter sign-ups totaled 5,118 homes, an increase of 7% over the prior year. As Richard noted in his comments, on a dollar basis, sign-ups increased 11% to $1.8 billion, our highest quarterly value in eight years. By brand, unit sign-ups increased 27% at Pulte and decreased 13% and 7% at Centex and Del Webb, respectively. Adjusting for community count, absorption paces increased 6% at Pulte and 4% at Del Webb, while declining 7% at Centex. Lower reported Centex paces were driven in part by acquired communities in Columbus and Louisville, which are still transitioning to new products and processes.","During the second quarter, we operated from 630 communities, which is up 7% from the comparable prior-year period. Plans still call for us to open approximately 200 new communities during 2015. Depending upon the ultimate timing of community openings and closings, we expect to operate from approximately 610 to 625 communities in both Q3 and Q4. And finally, we ended Q2 with a backlog of 8,998 homes valued at $3.1 billion, which is up from 8,179 homes valued at $2.8 billion last year.","Now, let me turn the call back to Richard.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob. You just heard Bob provide a breakdown of our business by brand, but we have had discussions internally about whether this data provides a complete picture of our homebuilding business. Why do we say this? As we have talked about on our prior calls, in 2014, we undertook a comprehensive study of active adult consumers. Then, this year, we launched a comparable study of first-time homebuyers to identify underserved market opportunities.","Last year's research has already led to our developing smaller, active adult communities. And while the first-time buyers study is still wrapping up, it shows distinct differences across the spectrum of first-time buyers, from traditional entry-level to millennials. While externally, we discuss buyer activity along brand lines for the sake of simplicity, investors who have followed PulteGroup for a while know that we actually design communities to serve 11 targeted consumer groups or TCGs. From the community location and lot layout to the specific floor plans and options we offer, we develop each community to address distinct buyer wants and needs.","Our TCG process and brands usually align, but not always. For example, some of our newer, smaller active adult communities are marketed under the Pulte Homes brand to differentiate them from large, highly amenitized Del Webb offerings that may also be in the market. At the same time, within our array of communities are those developed to serve a subset of first-time buyers who prioritize proximity to downtown over schools and single-family design. Based on experience and consistent with this year's market research work, the buyers for these communities are very much today's millennials who are moving out of shared living arrangements and into their first homes. While geared to first-time homebuyers, these communities typically sell under a Pulte Homes brand.","The active adult communities under the Pulte brand are just ramping up in number, but communities serving first-time millennial buyers under the Pulte brand accounted for roughly 10% of our communities and 500 sign-ups in the second quarter. And based on our project pipeline, our investment is growing consistent with increased first-time buyer demand. On future calls, we'll look for ways to efficiently bridge the gaps between our brand information and the more fundamental TCG data to provide clearer insights into our consumer-focused approach to the market.","Before we open the call to questions, let me close out my comments with a quick overview of market conditions. Consistent with comments made earlier in this call, overall demand in the second quarter was solid, with strong buyer traffic to our communities and sign-up gains in both units and dollars. Generally, demand trends at the market level have remained fairly constant over the past several quarters.","At a high level, conditions in the quarter were as follows: Starting on the East Coast, we experienced strong demand pretty much across the board from Massachusetts to Florida. As we have highlighted in the past, Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas continue to demonstrate notable strength. We have also seen improvements further up the coast, particularly in the Northeast. Working our way toward the central third of the country, the Midwest generally experienced a favorable demand environment although we saw volatility between markets and periods.","I'd like to make a comment about our Columbus and Kentucky markets which we entered last year through the purchase of certain Dominion assets. The team there has done a great job repositioning select communities and building the business, while getting integrated into our systems and adopting our common plan processes and related strategic pricing programs. Both markets are very healthy and we are pleased to have a business presence there. Dropping down into Texas, demand softness at higher price points in Houston, which we have commented on previously, is being exacerbated by shortfalls in lot availability in certain communities across the state, resulting from rain-induced development delays.","Traffic to our communities across the Texas markets indicate that buyer interest remains high, but consumers have more products from which to choose as additional supplies in the market. Demand conditions out west remained strong from Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico and into California. If there is a market or sub-market where we experience any softness in sales, the issue is more likely product availability than buyer interest.","We are certainly encouraged by the demand conditions we saw in the quarter and over the spring selling season. I will say, however, that market, sub-market and community locations matter, with better closer-in positions generally still faring better in the quarter and through the first few weeks of July. From PulteGroup's perspective, we would say the spring selling season was a successful one for the company and one that leaves us well positioned for the coming quarters. We experienced strong sign-ups allowing us to end the quarter with a backlog of almost 9,000 homes, our highest backlog in years. At the same time, we have a robust land pipeline that we continue to expand through our disciplined investment process, and our operations continue to deliver superior gross margins with the potential for significant overhead leverage as delivery volumes climb in the last two quarters of the year.","Finally, we maintain what might be the strongest balance sheet and financial position in the industry. We view the flexibility this provides us as an important competitive advantage as we continue to move through the housing cycle. The strength of our market and financial positions are a direct reflection of the hard work of our 4,000 employees. And I want to recognize and thank them for their efforts.","Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Jim?","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Thank you, Richard. We'll now open the call for questions so that we can speak with as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourselves to one question and to one follow-up. Steve, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys, good morning. Nice quarter and congrats on the buyback activity. I think that's going to be well received.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Alan,","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","First question on the backlog conversion and the closings. I think last quarter, you highlighted that you really expect to see most of the catch-up from the weather issues, more 3Q, 4Q. Was hoping you could just give us an update there on how you think closings are going to play out over the course of the remainder of the year. And with the new spec strategy or I guess a little bit higher spec total, is that something that we should kind of factor in to closing and order estimates for this year or is that more in anticipation of the 2016 selling season?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Alan, it's Richard. A couple of things, we really don't use conversion rate as something that we track a lot internally. But weather in the second quarter did impact our delivery schedule. And I would just say this, with regard to the balance of the year, we expect that conversion rates to trend back towards historical norms through Q3 and Q4. Relative to the spec comments Bob made, one thought there, we are not dramatically changing our spec position, but we are going to introduce selected spec deliveries to help even out production cadence. And that's more of a 2016 impact than anything you could expect this year.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it, thank you. And then one follow-up. On the pricing environment, you mentioned margins should be pretty flat with 2Q. Was curious what you're seeing on the pricing side. Is pricing power accelerating in any of your markets? And if so, how do you think about the margin outlook maybe beyond the next couple of quarters? Do you feel like the bias is more to the upside from current levels or are you still striving for maintaining a current kind of 23% level on a go-forward basis?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, this is Richard again. I'll say that we're pleased with our margin trajectory. And we're happy with the guidance that we provided, which is up slightly from what we said before. From a pricing perspective, I think we believe there is more upside than downside to pricing. We're going to have watch what happens with the economy and with rates overall. But we wouldn't want to provide, Alan, any commentary beyond the guidance that Bob gave. So nothing really at this point for 2016, our backlog visibility isn't quite that far yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thanks very much, guys. Good results. Let me ask you a question if I could about the orders. I think you mentioned about Centex down 7%. You were talking about some acquisition-related effects. Can you just give a little more granularity about that? What you meant by that and sort of what we're seeing on the ground which is driving that negative impact?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Stephen, this is Bob. What we were highlighting was that the cases out of the Columbus and Kentucky are slower. So if you had excluded that, for instance, from our Centex results, our Centex paces would have been flat quarter-over-quarter.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, okay. That's great. The second question relates to a comment \u2013 or I think a thread of conversation that you and I had a month or so ago where you were talking about some consumer research I think that you were conducting regarding the entry level. And I think one of the takeaways was that you were starting to see that millennials or entry-level buyers are willing to trade size for proximity. So, they're not willing to drive till they qualify kind of thing. They kind of want to live closer to the job centers and were willing to take a smaller footprint home to do that. I wanted to follow up with you, see whether or not that is in fact what your research has concluded. And if so, do you have any availability in your existing communities or ones that you sort of teed up here over the next year or two to sort of accommodate maybe some smaller, more entry-level product into existing land positions, because that would seem to suggest you'd have to sort of rezone them, or not? If you could just sort of talk about the research and the conclusion \u2013 how you would deal with the conclusions in your \u2013 on the ground.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Stephen, it's Bob again. We have not concluded that research. We're making progress and so certainly before the end of this year. But for everybody's benefit, essentially what it would suggest is that there is a group of first-time buyers in that millennial age group that \u2013 and you said it will \u2013 are willing to trade size for proximity. And I think it's essentially what Richard talked about in his prepared remarks about that millennial buyer. And what it was trying to tell you was that it is already a pretty significant part of our portfolio of, again, not entry-level, but first-time buyers in that millennial age group. And so, we do have communities open today. Certainly, you've heard us talk about three quarters of our spend is Pulte-branded \u2013 it includes that buyer group. So yeah, we are actively serving them today.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Stephen, Richard with a little additional commentary. That's what we call our TCG3 category, which is part of that first-time buyer group that serve under the Pulte brand, and that was sort of a clarification we were providing at the end. In addition to it being a big piece, as Bob indicated, we also indicated in our prepared remarks it's a growing piece. And then lastly, we would not anticipate being able to rezone existing communities to take advantage of it, but that's not to discount the ramp up in investment activity geared toward that category, which will play out over the coming years.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, Richard. You'd mentioned \u2013 made two comments during your prepared remarks that I thought were interesting. One, you talked about investing appropriately as you move forward, and the other, better located, still performing well. Could you talk some about what that means to you, investing appropriately as you go through this cycle? And maybe you can put it in content versus this year. I don't know whatever works best, but then also the better located, still performing well in through July and all that, talk a little bit about what that means, better located, if you will.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Stephen, good morning. I would say from an investing appropriately standpoint, what we really mean by that is tied to our disciplined philosophy, where number one, we invest in the business and our land positions. And then the other investment choices come after that, including on increasing dividend, selective M&A and then residual cash being used for routine systematic buyback purchases. And I think you saw us execute against all of those this quarter. So we view that as very consistent.","And to put a little more granularity in it, we're very proud of the fact that we stuck to the appropriate investment philosophy, which leads to your second comment around better locations. What we're really trying to say there is, that's one of the reasons our margins are holding up well. We continue to believe we're buying the best dirt out there. We're not reaching for things. Overall, our land trajectory, our spend trajectory has been up; so we would expect a bigger business in the future and that's why we continued to invest where we are, while keeping all the other parameters in check, so hope that helps.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","It does. Thanks. And then sort of along those lines, your orders grew pretty much in line with your community count. I know you focused a lot more on margins over the last three years and have not been as focused on the absorption pace, if you will. As you look out, call it, over the next four quarters, six quarters, whatever timeframe you're comfortable putting on it, how do you view that dynamic? Are you at a point in the cycle where you think your absorption should be greater or you still are \u2013 that's just secondary to what you're doing on the gross profit line?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Stephen, our overall goal, we've said it repeatedly, is return on invested capital. And the blend between pace and price is a tricky one in every single community, and frankly, it depends on the community overall. I would be hard pressed to say whether we had more opportunity in margin or pace going forward. But I will tell you this, we've made a lot of progress on margin over the past few years. We haven't provided any guidance sort of beyond that, but we're looking to balance both. And for us, everything from compensation to the way we talk about the business is really ROIC. We've emphasized margins a lot these past few years because our margins needed a lot of improvement overall. And at this stage, we're really talking about returns. So I apologize for not being able to give you more specificity there, but that's the way we're looking at it.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark (sic) [Mike] Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and the helpful color here. Wanted to just ask a question, maybe a little more granularly on the margin guidance because it seems like if you're holding these levels for the next couple quarters, it nets out to like slightly above 23%. And the previous guide was approximately, so are we talking was the previous guide really like a 22.8% and now it's a 23.2%? Or just any sense of magnitude on just really what the increase is.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike, it's Bob. We have, just trying to clarify, we have been speaking to 23% certainly in the last quarter since we delivered in excess of that and have suggested that we'll continue to. And with the seasonality of the business, the production being more geared towards the back half of the year, we would blend to a higher rate than 23% and just wanted to point that out.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And then shifting to some of the color around Texas, obviously some challenging conditions as you noted with the weather. But were some of those comments also around just being the high end pricing issues being exacerbated by shortages, but then there was also a comment about more competition. Was that also still isolated at the high end or was that a broader issue that you're seeing on the market \u2013 on the ground in Houston?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Mike, this is Richard. Rain throughout Texas hampered results across the state for the quarter, particular with regard to production. The comment we made regarding the high end was specific to Houston, but the comment we made regarding a little bit more inventory in the market is statewide. So our overall view on Texas, we like Texas. We like the market environment. It's a little more competitive than it was. We're trying to say it as matter-of-factly as we can.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, and congrats on a very nice quarter.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I've got a lot of very positive feedback on your share buyback activity. And just, I think, speaking to some of Richard's comments about land prices being inflated. If you don't find what you need in terms of land supply to your expectations, what is the priority for that excess cash? Does it go to share buybacks or what do you want to do with it?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bob, this is Bob. I think the answer is we look at that every year. Certainly, we have been more active in the share repurchase arena, that's largely not a call on the equity, it's actually just capital structuring; we're below our targeted range of 30% to 40%, leverage at 26%, so we feel we have significant capacity to do that. But again, first and foremost, we want to invest in the business. You can see that in the investment levels. Going forward, we'll look at that with a forward view as based on our best estimates of what the business can do. Certainly, you heard Richard talk about the priority is investing in the business, paying an increasing dividend. So we look at dividends. M&A activity, if it's out there, we would opportunistically look at, and then the rest would be share repurchases.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. So my other question is just on that theme of reinvesting back into the business. Today, when you're looking at the incremental dollar spend that you're going to put in, which of your three brands is most likely to get that dollar? And geographically, where are you trying to invest the most? Thanks and good luck.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bob.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob. Richard here. Thus far in housing recovery, and we've been pretty consistent in this, we've been putting most of our dollars into the Pulte brand to serve that move-up category. I would say there is an increasing focus on the entry-level for us, and again, we're trying to highlight in our commentary that we've been actually putting quite a bit of capital toward the first-time buyer, that millennial category, to serve that growing category. And we'll have more to say about that in the future as our study continues. And then I'd say some selective Del Webb investments in smaller positions across the system. So, overall I'd say Pulte is the priority and then probably the other two categories with a fairly balanced approach, but always trying to seek the highest return; so it can vary from quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. And your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question just on the segments, you kind of mentioned that the Pulte brand, in a sense, is bleeding into the other, if I could use that term, bleeding into the other categories in terms of serving some of the Del Webb demand as well as perhaps some of the entry-level or millennial demand. And I'm just curious when you think about, if you were to report ASPs and particularly closings is what I'm getting at, not by the brand, but by broader, let's say, entry-level move-up, entry-level\/move-up for Centex, active adult instead of Del Webb, which would include perhaps some of that Pulte-branded offerings. At this point, would the Centex and Del Webb percentages be up by a couple percent? And given the morphing or brand extension of Pulte, is this perhaps how you might report the segments from a demographic perspective going forward?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so, sorry, I hate to be technical. Our segments are geographic, Mike. We present this information for simplicity when we're talking to Wall Street. But I think the answer is, and what Richard highlighted, we are seeing a future pipeline of that active adult that's Pulte-branded. We have an existing book of business that is first-time buyer that is Pulte-branded. And he highlighted the amount of that. And so, I think what it would show you, if you looked at it in the way that you just asked, that entry-level first-time buyer group would be bigger than our Centex brand. You wouldn't see much of a change out of Pulte into the active adult, so that wouldn't change much. So I think what we're looking at is how to make that information digestible without confusing people with too much data.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right, right. Yeah, no, I think that kind of the continuation of thinking about that would certainly be helpful and maybe, again, broadening the \u2013 instead of Centex, Del Webb, maybe just broadening the definition, so to speak. Secondly, you mentioned Texas and also California in your regional review. I was hoping to get a little bit more, if possible, market-by-market review of California, how the different markets are going. As well as when you talk about Texas being slightly more competitive, is that just in the form of perhaps discounts coming up a little bit by percentage or two, or if you're seeing any price reductions?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mike, it's Richard. With regard to California, what we're seeing is the better located assets are doing extremely well. Some of the outer-lying positions not quite as well, but where you have very, very well-located communities, we're seeing a lot of strength. With regard to Texas, overall, the Dallas market is the strongest of the markets, but our commentary overall is not really related to discounts. It's just a little bit more inventory in the market across the state. Not a dramatic shift, but something that we've noticed over the past couple of quarters overall, so again, still a good housing market. One that we're pleased to be in, but a little more competitive than it was.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. So I wanted to ask \u2013 I think you mentioned either in your slides or your press release about an increase in the amount of land that's optioned. Was that a change over the last couple of quarters? Are you seeing any kind of change in increase in options available or could you maybe give more detail on what's going on there?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Megan, it's Bob. We have been seeking to do more option transactions and I would say it goes back over years, not quarters. You've seen a gradual increase, I think, in the data we've presented. It showed 10%, up to now 30%. And the answer is, to your second question, is it more available? Really not. So, what we're seeing is a lot more raw transaction. So historically, it was a healthier developer base in the country. You might have seen more opportunity to do finished lot option takedowns. What we're really talking about is, if there's a position and I'll make up a fact pattern that has 600 lots in it, and we've got a current need for 200 of them, of medium-term need for 200 more and then a longer-term need for 200 more, what we're trying to do is structure transactions that would allow us to take the first third, control the second third and third third over time. But we would be the developer typically, and so it comes down to a parcel-by-parcel negotiation.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Megan, Richard here. One of the reasons we highlighted it is just when you look at it over the few years, as Bob indicated, it's a pretty dramatic improvement and very consistent with our overall focus on a much more balanced approach with regard to capital. So in addition to the priorities for capital, even within the land priority, we're very proud of the fact that we're controlling a lot more lots while not taking here as much risk as we have in the past.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Great, thanks. And then just a little more clarification on the first-time buyer discussion. I think you're trying to answer this, but let me just clarify. You mentioned in your initial comments that there is evidence in the market that the first-time buyer is coming back. You mentioned statistics from the NAR and you also mentioned that the new stuff \u2013 that your Centex was flat, so are you saying that you are actually seeing it, it's just in these Pulte-branded communities? Or are you saying there's some evidence, but you're not actually seeing it yet in your order growth?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, Megan, if you go back over the last year or two, we've had pretty strong comps in terms of the Centex brand and not just in Texas. We've highlighted other parts of the country, but Texas is a big part of our Centex business. So I think we've seen, although flat absorptions this quarter, ex-Louisville and Columbus, we've seen pretty good results over time. And to your question in terms of what's in the Pulte brand, I don't have the data right now to tell you what that first-time buyer component that we've flagged Pulte is. But obviously, the Pulte same-store comps were up 6%, so you can certainly conclude that it was a portion of that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning. Another question on the first-time buyer and how it relates to the Pulte brand expansion. What I think I'm hearing is the strategy on the first-time for Pulte is, hey, look, we're going to keep focusing on that higher income, first-time buyer, maybe the larger house in part to preserve margin, more so than a lower margin, lesser location Centex-type product. Is that a fair interpretation of where we're at on the first-time strategy?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jack, I don't think it's either, candidly. What we're trying to highlight is that under the Pulte brand, as I think everyone's aware, we have been serving this millennial buyer. And sort of the traditional view of an entry-level consumer buying a home in their mid-20s and then trading up, et cetera, over time is changing. And in fact we're seeing a lot of people actually skip the Centex true entry-level product, say at $200,000, and buy a Pulte-branded home at $300,000 in their early-to-mid-30s, typically consistent with when they either get married or begin living together, and their housing needs change from rental to ownership.","We have been doing quite a bit of that business with the Pulte brand. And it's in an urban sort of infill location, it's clearly targeted to that upwardly mobile millennial buyer. And as we started peeling through the data in response to lots of questions from investors, we wanted to just provide a little bit more clarity that that was a significant portion of our business. And we were not ignoring the growing interest in what's happening with the millennial category overall. So we've been doing a lot of that business through the Pulte brand with townhome product, a little bit of condominium product, and it's not an insignificant amount of our business, as we indicated, about 500 closings in the recent quarter. So, we're simply just trying to introduce this concept that our brand strategy was not always perfectly consistent with first-time move-up and active adult. And going forward, we're looking for ways to clarify that a little bit more.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, thank you. And then I think Richard, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that land was heating up. Any way you can give us sort of a magnitude of rate of change. And then curious if the step-up in buyback is in any way related to that higher \u2013 a higher, more expensive land picture that you mentioned?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll start and then Bob may want to add something here, Jack. First of all, the land environment has been competitive for the last several quarters. And we haven't noted anything unique this particular quarter overall. And as it relates to our buyback activity, starting last fall, we told investors very clearly that we had a priority for investment, first in land, second increasing dividend, third, opportunistic M&A, and then fourth, residual cash for systemic and routine buybacks, and we've been executing exactly against that.","As Bob indicated, our leverage is a little bit lower than we like it. We had free cash flow. And I think we're extremely pleased with the flexibility we have. It's not an either-or for us. So we were able to step up our land purchases fairly significantly in the range of the guidance we provided, while still paying down debt and repurchasing shares at a higher rate than we had. So it wasn't particularly related to a spike in land prices this quarter, but more of an execution on our strategy that we think over time provides the best returns for our shareholders.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jack. The only thing I'd add to that on the land piece is it's important to remember, and you heard Richard talking about, that we are seeking better located assets, and the reality is those are always competitive.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Will Randow with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Will.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Will.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In terms of your two years of developed supply, is that skewed towards controlled? I won't expect it to. And do you think that's enough developed lot supply if we see demand pick up incrementally?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not sure I understand the question, Will. You say it is our two-year supply?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe you could repeat it, Will, if you don't mind.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure, sure, sorry about that. Your two years of developed lots in terms of supply.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Do you think that's skewed \u2013 is that skewed towards controlled in any way? And do you feel like that's enough lot supply if we were to see demand pick up?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think the answer is, it's going to be market-by-market. There are certain markets where we have ample supply of lots in front of us. There are others where we're working through and developing lots as we go. I think we've got 27% of our lots are finished\/owned, 26% are under development. So we feel pretty good, but you heard Richard talk about in Texas when we get weather, it can slow you down, so it's always a work-in-process.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for that. And in terms of the, as a follow-up, the $27 million legal settlement, do you expect any further reoccurrence of that? And what is the cash flow hit from that?","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, actually, this is a reversal of an accrual, so it means we won't spend the cash.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And it's really just another step in the process of settling construction issues, one that had been working its way through the courts for a number of years.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS. Your line is open.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Susan.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Your Centex ASP rose 6% during the quarter despite some of the sort of issues around the acquisitions and things in that segment. Can you just talk a little bit about what drove that and how we should be thinking about it going forward?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Susan, it's actually a mix issue. It's because of the production issues in Texas, which has our lowest Centex-priced product, so the mix is just different.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then looking long, bigger picture, with the potential rise in rate that's coming this year, are you hearing from any of your buyers that that's factoring into their decision process yet? Or maybe how that will eventually factor into their thoughts and getting them maybe to pull the trigger and make that purchase decision?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Susan, it's Richard. I would say it's a little early yet for that to have played out. Rates just did begin rising here over the last month to six weeks primarily. Historically, I would say that does drive purchase behavior as people kind of fear the loss of a low rate environment. So we certainly don't fear that occurring, provided that it continues with the economy continuing to strengthen. But are we hearing a lot of anecdotal information on the ground about that? I'd say not yet.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks guys. I'm just trying to interpret some of the comments and maybe read between the lines here. But based on the land investment strategies and the talk about the first-time millennial buyer, which may be acting and behaving differently than previous generations, I'm kind of wondering is there a sense that the core Centex, that entry-level suburban sub-$200,000 price point, is that really going to have a recovery in this cycle? And I'm guessing what are your thoughts about \u2013 do we really need to maintain the Centex land positions at this point or do we \u2013 is there a need to continue reinvesting in that product?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Buck, this is Richard. We absolutely want to continue reinvesting in that area when returns make sense. And nothing in our commentary would suggest that we don't believe that's an important part of a housing recovery. I would say, however, consistent with what we said in the past, making the returns work for those more suburban, lower-priced product is more challenging still today. And we would expect that as the housing recovery continues that that will get a little bit easier as pace continues to come back into that segment. So that's a little bit disconnected, candidly, from our comments about the millennials. We're simply trying to highlight with regard to the millennials that there's a growing appetite for a fairly affluent, in-town urban buyer that wants this attached product that we have been delivering and will continue to.","But with regard to Centex proper, if you will, the kind of traditional entry-level $200,000 price point as an example, that's an important part of the business, particularly in Texas, and particularly some of the southeast markets that we want to continue to invest in. It just hasn't warranted the ramp up in investment that some of the other categories have yet, but we're watching it closely and we candidly expect it to at some point in the housing recovery.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just because it was brought up earlier in a quick comment, but there was a mention about you'd potentially look at M&A transactions if they would make sense, I guess. I'm wondering what criteria and under what circumstances you guys would think about M&A? Is that mainly looking at other private players or potentially another public-to-public transaction? What was maybe behind that comment or thought process?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nothing new there. We highlighted that it would be one of the priorities for our utilization of capital. I wouldn't want to speculate as to whether it would be a private or public builder. We would typically look at these as land transactions though. So we use the same basic underwriting criteria for a transaction for a group of assets from a builder as we would for a single community. So it's really a land play for us.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. So, on the interest rate question, we've seen rates rising through most of this year, through, particularly in the second quarter. So, is there anything that you've seen on your month-by-month trends or maybe through your mortgage operation that could give us some sense of whether the rising rate environment has spurred people on or whether it has caused people to back away from purchases?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know that there's anything that you would be able to know what would've happened if rates had been different. One thing that you can see is that people are locking a little bit earlier. People are not choosing arms. So from the financing perspective, it influences their behavior in terms of how much risk do they want to take coming up to the closing. But I haven't heard any detailed commentary about \u2013 I'm not buying because of interest rates or I bought today because interest rates might go up.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And you've talked a good bit about the weather, you addressed Texas mainly, as I understand it, in your comments so far. So, in the Midwest and the Northeast, there were also some pretty significant rains towards the end of the second quarter particularly in June. You folks obviously have decent-sized operations in those regions. So any effect on those regions either from a demand perspective or from a deferral of closings, construction schedules perspective?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nishu, it's Richard. I would say what we've seen in the rest of the country, you'd typically see somewhere in the country with regard to weather. So we haven't called it out uniquely. Clearly, weather always plays a factor in production. It's not as big a factor with regard to sales unless it prevents you from opening communities, which the reason we called out Texas this time is it was so unique. It caused some community delays, which impacted our sales environment some, but more importantly, helped to cause the production shortfall that we've seen through the first couple of quarters of the year. So beyond that, nothing that we would note, particularly.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. On the capital structure, wanted to get a sense as to where you think you are today. Is your cash position about where you'd want it to be? And do you feel that you are still under-levered? And what might be the key metrics that we should be thinking about to understand what you view as an optimal capital structure?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, what we've highlighted is that we'd like to have leverage and it sort of hinges off of leverage somewhere between 30% and 40%. We're obviously a little bit below that today. We have just under $500 million of cash at the end of the quarter. We have several hundred million dollars of availability under our credit facility above and beyond that. So, we feel like we have a really strong liquidity position. Obviously, we chose to pay down our debt instead of refinancing it with the maturity in the second quarter. So going forward, I think as we look at it, a lot of it will depend on our expectations for investment in the business, and obviously we reforecast that periodically, coupled with our expectations for cash generation out of the business.","And so, in looking at it, I think it's fair to assume we've got a pretty big maturity coming up next year, so we'll be looking at our leverage over the next two quarters, three quarters to figure out what makes sense. We pay attention to capital markets activity all the time to see if there are attractive entry points. So, I think we're very comfortable running with this much cash and even a little bit less, candidly, because we have so much availability under the revolver. And then we think we've got access to the capital markets on terms that what would be attractive. So, when we need to, we have a way to fill any cash shortfalls that we might want to deal with. So, again, leverage being between 30% and 40% is what is driving most of our decision making.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And so is it fair to say \u2013 because I guess you had to make that decision whether to go refinance or not. And I certainly see that you might've decided to, yes, go out and refinance now, and yet, you choose not to. Is that because you want to have a greater degree of line of sight in terms of the investments in land and development opportunities that would have justified putting more debt on that balance sheet?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we feel like we do have pretty good line of sight into our projected spend, certainly over the next six months to 12 months. So what it tells you is we have obviously a business that is cash-accretive. We're not paying cash taxes. We have a lot of production coming in the back half of this year, which will be generating a lot of cash. We're also going to be investing a lot, but we didn't feel any pressure that says, oh, gosh, we should go refinance this debt. So really, it's just an evaluation as time goes on.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask in terms of the ROIC focus. Could you talk about the returns on potentially selling some of the land that you may have earmarked for some of these entry-level and maybe a little more spec-heavy communities? Because it looks like in the first half of this year, you guys have run a land gross margin of about 22%. Last year, I think it was roughly 31%. So, I think there would be a case \u2013 there's a case to be made that you might make more from selling that land, especially with the appreciation you've discussed rather than trying to put maybe some gross margin-dilutive homes out there.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jay, this is Richard. Several years ago, about three years ago, we undertook a really deep-dive look at every single position in our balance sheet. And we were pretty clear with investors that we did intend to sell a portion of land and we've done most of that. I don't know what the exact numbers are, but somewhere around $300 million of land over the past few quarters have been sold.","So it's always a portion of our portfolio, and from time to time, there'll be a position that gets sold. I would say a lot of that heavy lifting is done. It's also hard to predict the timing on it, so we couldn't give you any good projections, but there's not a concerted effort to wipe off a portion of the balance sheet there. We would rather develop that into home sites and capture the margin on the land as well as the home. We've gotten pretty efficient at capturing margin on the home in addition to any built-in land appreciation. So we prefer to capture it that way. And given the fact that our prudence with regard to our capital structure has been what it's been, we're pretty happy about that decision. So I wouldn't look for any big land sales.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Okay. And then just did want to ask a follow-on on the debt question with the 2016's and 2017's coming due. I mean is it \u2013 could you talk a little bit more about, could you refinance potentially both transactions at one shot? Or do you think you have a better shot at paying it off? Just a little more color on the 2016's and the 2017's?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Don't want to comment on 2016's and 2017's, other than to say we obviously look at them as we think about our leverage. I don't think necessarily it makes sense for us to go and take everything out. We'd probably start to want to build the leverage ladder again. So you'd see us putting different things in place, but not trying to take care of all our current maturities. But, you never know. Time will tell.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey there, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So I guess first question is follow-up on some other comments that you made on spec. I guess specifically, your appetite here for raising spec count levels. As you look across your platform, are there regions today where increasing spec count makes sense? Is it across the board? And how do margins on your spec compare to margins on build-to-order?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, our comments \u2013 this is Richard, Haendel. Our comments on spec are related to help us with regard to managing production cadence overall, and it would be on a very limited amount. We have gotten very, very comfortable and happy with our build-to-order model. So we're not trying to signal any kind of shift in priority. We just want to let you know we may feather in some additional spec in select communities to give us an opportunity to help even out our production cadence. And I would suggest the margin impact of that would be very, very minimal because we're not talking about any significant real change in spec policy.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you, appreciate that. And second question is, I guess, another margin-related question. Curious to what extent mix was playing a factor in driving gross margin higher sequentially and whether specific areas were able to contain costs versus the first quarter.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, on a sequential basis, actually, our margins are up across all three of our brands as well as a little bit of a benefit from interest. So no concentrated issue there, just better performance across the entire spectrum.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Gentlemen.","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Ken.","Robert T. O'Shaughnessy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Ken.","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I wonder, I have two questions. One, is your success in gross margins, which is adjusted for commissions, industry-leading, is that kind of actually trapping you into a narrower opportunity in terms of how you're looking to invest, perhaps?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, this is Richard. I would say absolutely not. We've tried to be as clear as we can that we run the business based on returns. And frankly, whether margins go up from here or go down from here, if we get excellent returns on it, that's the name of the game for us, and our land priorities are not margin-specific. They're return-specific as we look at the 200-plus communities we're going to open this year, it's all based on returns. So, no, I don't think gross margins have trapped us into anything. We're happy with our gross margins, we've done a good job with our gross margins. We're proud of them, but I don't think it limits what we do going forward at all.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good. And I asked that \u2013 I was obviously doing that respectfully because you do have very high gross margins. And I'm thinking about another builder that also focuses on returns, but in that investment process, pursued a lower price point, got a higher absorption. I agree with that approach, but obviously there's a wider view perhaps from investors in terms of interpreting if that's good to have the gross margins go down as they're not as focused, investors, perhaps on the returns on capital. Could you perhaps highlight little concerns or thoughts you've had on how others have enacted that return on capital as it relates to lower gross margins?","Richard J. Dugas, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you have to appreciate it in terms of what the company's overall philosophy is. And for us, it's very related to our overall capital approach. And if we were as focused on land investment exclusively as we were five years or 10 years ago, we might have a little bit of a different posture here. But given the fact that we want to be involved in all aspects of capital allocation, which we are very convinced over the housing cycle is going to be the best total shareholder return for shareholders, has dictated our philosophy. So, I wouldn't want to comment on what anyone else is doing. I would just say that we think we're doing a good job quarter-in and quarter-out and balancing it. And over time, we're very confident that it's going to yield the right result. We've learned our lesson in the past of trying to overdo it on the land side, and we're really pleased with our balanced and prudent approach today, so I hope that helps.","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Yeah, and just to close that out, Ken, it's Jim, we've talked for a while now about not being so focused on just driving unit volumes or driving volumes for volumes' sake and really being more focused on, to Richard's point, about the returns. And as a consequence, the investments and everything line up accordingly.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Zeumer, I turn the call back over to you.","James P. Zeumer - Vice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Great. Thanks, everybody, for your time this morning. We'll certainly be around for the remainder of the day if you've got any additional questions. We'll look forward to speaking with you on our next call.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
