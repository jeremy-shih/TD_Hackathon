My name is Jedi, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Morton Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our June quarter and fiscal 2018 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com.","During today's call, we will review the highlights for the June quarter in the fiscal year 2018, provide the company's outlook for the September quarter, and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits. For the September quarter, we'd like to note that our quiet period will begin on September 24.","On our call today, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our Web site. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and\/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about: the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance; customer and market demand in the current macroeconomic conditions; industry growth and trends; our technology and product development advancements and our ability to achieve volume shipment for new product development in 2019; demand for our products; continuity of access to long-term NAND supply; the expected return on our investments; our ability to execute our roadmap and address supply constraints while managing an agile manufacturing footprint; potential impact of trade barriers, such as import\/export duties and restrictions, tariffs and quotas; and, general market conditions.","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investor section of the company Web site.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave Mosley. Please go ahead, Dave.","William David Mosley","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.","I\u2019m pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, GAAP gross margins of 31.9%, and net income of $461 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.","On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%, net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62. HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year and the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million and free cash flow was $372 million.","Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results, our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. Strong year-over-year growth and exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and their alignment with the growing demand for data products globally.","For the full fiscal year of 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations, up 10% year-over-year and $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year. GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31%, respectively. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year. GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7% and total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.","I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today in addition to our earnings results regarding our CFO transition. Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to three years and with the company for over 23 years has decided to leave Seagate for a Senior Finance Executive role at another company.","We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role and the Board has appointed Kate Scolnick, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the Company Treasurer and over the last six years has been an integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. On behalf of the management team and the Board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. And I\u2019d also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","David H. Morton, Jr.","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments.","For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabyte with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over last year and up 54% from the June quarter two years ago.","In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in a 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10 terabytes nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter and we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12 terabytes nearline product.","As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network attached storage.","At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub 1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue.","Non-hard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions.","We believe that our strategic approach to participate in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structure and business mix.","Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year and free cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 18% year-over-year. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.","Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential upside in gross margins included better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.","On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.","Capital expenditures on a cash basis were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital. For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.","Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our Board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million.","During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. Our net debt to the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.","In the June quarter as part of a consortium led by the Bain Private Equity, we finalized our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held to maturity over its 6-year life. For fiscal 2018, we returned 51% of cash flow from operations to the shareholders, slightly above the high-end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%.","And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate storage products. As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region.","In response to the tariff changes that took place this month we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect will be evaluating additional minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. Going forward, we'll update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.","Overall, our operational and financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.","I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley.","William David Mosley","Thanks, Dave. Strong global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting mature market trends as in -- such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.","Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring mass storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we're bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers.","An important aspect of Seagate storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers. These qualifications are going well and our expectations are to achieve double-digit sequential quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year.","With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets.","We remain bit constrained and we're working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs as we actively work to optimize our media and heads for our entire mass storage solution product set. We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially, demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.","Cash flow from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range, as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products, continue to ramp to yield our highest capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio, and ramp our SSD business revenue. Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high.","We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. Toward these efforts, we're executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially.","Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then decline to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model and at the low-end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%. To address the high-capacity mass storage HDD demand signals and the product transitions we've planned for FY19 and beyond, we're increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December quarter's to approximately 6% of revenue. For the fiscal year, we're forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.","In summary, I\u2019d like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well-positioned for future success and value creation in FY2019 and beyond. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we'll now open-up the call for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Huberty","Thank you. Good morning. It seems like the biggest tailwind, but also a risk going forward is how strong the enterprise HDD business was in June. So, just wonder whether you can comment on what you see over the next six months from both the mission-critical business where you saw upside as well as whether you're seeing any softening in cloud demand? And then just as a follow-on to that, three months ago, you talked about better seasonal volumes as well as the ramp of high cap in SSD, new products helping margins in the back half, but it doesn't sound like you expect sequential improvement as you go into the September quarter. So just wondering if anything has changed on that front. Thank you.","William David Mosley","Thanks, Katy. So mission-critical has been fairly steady, I would say. Last quarter was a little bit higher than last couple of quarters, so we\u2019re watching it carefully to see if we do need to ratchet that up, but I would consider that market very stable. On the cloud front, there are a number of different things going on. And I would say that demand continues very strong. Strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up at 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see as people continue to do these buildouts you see the demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads and media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next six months. To some extent the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future that\u2019s very strong. Dave, do you want to \u2026?","David H. Morton, Jr.","Yes, in regards to the back half of the year, specifically as the sequential margin impact, I'd tell you everything remains on track. With that said, I just think there's some cautiousness in and around some of the regular inflationary pressures we see both from raw materials as well as some of the wage inflation. And as we continue to navigate through that, as we continue to be a bit constrained on particularly at the higher end of those capacity points, obviously that will continue to shape our -- us meeting that margin profile and moving into the higher end of that range, Katy.","William David Mosley","That\u2019s right, Katy. So we really want to answer the higher mix that we're seeing all the time. And as we do that, we\u2019ve to launch new products. Some of those new products we have to get to yield -- ramp to yield as quickly as we can. And those are some of the headwinds that we\u2019re facing I think, but long-term I don't think those trends are bad for us. I think they\u2019re very good.","Kathryn Huberty","Okay. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.","William David Mosley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering on the NAND front, if you could just maybe provide a little bit more detail on how exactly that ramp proceeds? You gave some color on the revenues, but if you think about a waterfall where you can have the most success commercially for a second, third as you go through the next few quarters and where, that would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up.","William David Mosley","Yes. Steve, I don't think we want to tip our hand too much. But you can see from the interfaces that we\u2019re addressing, that we're really going after the enterprise most heavily, I mean, Seagate has deep experience with SaaS drives, of course, and that's what we've had qualified in the past. So the transition as we get more NAND supply online, the transition in some of those existing customers already took to just more market share. And maybe a little bit of horizontal proliferation to the new customers as well as possible in SaaS. NVMe is -- as we all know, it's fairly new and changing very quickly. There's a lot of demand for new feature sets. We feel fairly linked in with customers there and we feel like we've a pretty good product portfolio. So as the market switches to NVMe, especially with enterprise features associated with that, with our customer intimacy we should do pretty well. There are also other consumer and gaming markets that we will try to deploy the new assets against, but it look -- really stays -- we really stay focused on enterprise.","Steven Fox","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just -- obviously, it's a small bump up in CapEx and you\u2019re talking about this being continued. But I was curious in terms of the Q1 increase in CapEx, like what bottlenecks are you addressing with that? Is it more related to components or testing etcetera?","William David Mosley","Yes, they\u2019re short-term and long-term. The component piece will be relatively longer lead times, so we\u2019re looking out into FY20 and '21 and making sure we have the right comp on stands with the market there. But there will be some short-term tactical things like more test capacity and things like that, because as we move to higher and higher capacity points for the individual disk drives, then we need more test capacity to answer that.","Steven Fox","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the solid results. Hey, just real quick, Dave, congrats. It's been great working with you and the company certainly performed well while you\u2019ve been in the role. So we look forward to seeing what\u2019s next in store for you. Just a couple, if you could. Dave, just going back to cloud, when do you or have you yet -- are you yet able to get a sense of when you may not be in a cloud constrained environment, or when would you envision that if you have a sense of that being?","William David Mosley","Yes, so for watchers of the industry over the last 10 years, you\u2019ve seen these digestion phases that the cloud goes through. I would say in answer to Katy's question as well, we don't see that in the next six months. Some of that will be driven a little bit by what's going on in the macro, but we don't see that in the near horizon at least. Longer-term the nice thing for us right now is not only the propagation of customers globally, it's not just a few hyperscale people that are doing massive installs, its globally happening. The other thing is that these capacity points are driving north. So I think as people are doing the install, they\u2019re not just answering the call of yesterday's data, they\u2019re actually the data growth is very large. So they want our highest capacity drives. Just over the last few years we've seen almost a 40% CAGR, but just in this last period that we\u2019re in is ticking up. So we are watching carefully. I think, Amanda, to answer your question about any of these digestion phases that we've been bit by the past, but we don't see one in the near-term here.","Ananda Baruah","And how are the constraints impacting like-for-like kind of pricing? And are the dynamics impacting the tenure of contract conversations yet, with your customers?","William David Mosley","I do think that this cycle is getting people to acknowledge that they have to be a little bit more strategic on the install. And so, therefore if you\u2019re building a big data center, you don't show up in the last few weeks and surprise us with a bunch of new demand, because we just can't answer it in that kind of lead lines. I think most of our large-scale customers are smart about that and that is affecting that cycle that you made reference to. Pricing will still stay aggressive for the highest capacity points I think and we will continue to have to answer that with cost reductions and new product introductions in areal density is the same way we ever have.","Ananda Baruah","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO. Your line is now open.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just a few, if I could. On the new products you mentioned around security and workload [ph] enhancements, et cetera. Could you talk a little bit about how you see them ramping into the revenue model? And is there any of that in the September and December views? And then just on looking out to December with the sequential growth there, just give us a little sense as to your visibility into the numbers. It sounds like there's just tons of demand and capacity constrained, anything other than that you could talk about in the visibility? Thank you.","William David Mosley","So as far as the new feature developments, I would say that some of this comes with the maturation of the market. You see customers who want their specific applications optimized and there -- they can pick from a plethora of different features that we've developed arguably over the years for key OEMs or for some of the early movers in the cloud. Now you're starting to see optimization scenarios for some of the growing Tier 2 people and so on. I think what that does is it creates a great business relationship between the companies. It's not necessarily something that that drives a lot of increased revenue or anything other than the fact that it speeds up their transition and makes their data centers more effective, so that they can get done with -- to get done. Beyond six months from now, it's really hard to tell, I mean, we've all been through these cloud cycles before and so I'm -- maybe a little -- there's a little bit of trepidation always that there is another digestion phase coming. But again given how broad-based it is this time, I think it'll probably more muted and we will stay at or above the traditional growth rates, I think.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thank you. And also congratulations on the quarter. I just wanted to ask and going back with the silicon business. I know that you have mentioned 53% year-over-year growth and that kind of kicking in here as we go forward. I\u2019m just curious as we think about that line, how we should think about the gross margin of that business progressing? And kind of taking that also into consideration, it would appear that your hard disk drive gross margin is actually even healthily above that 29% to 33% range. So any kind of color of the sustainability of that hard disk drive gross margin as well.","William David Mosley","Yes, I think that over time given the new NAND supply agreement, we will be able to grow certainly accretive to our operating income, which is where really what I'm focused on. The SSD businesses that we have, the lines of business that we have. I think it is fair to say that so far it's been -- it's not been accretive on the gross margin line or the operating income line, and we\u2019re going to go over to fix that as we move forward.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And hard disk drive gross margin?","David H. Morton, Jr.","Yes, Aaron, we don\u2019t want to get into separation of that for obvious competitive reasons. Clearly, we have some upside opportunities as they had intimated on our silicon business. And so we look at it as just all accretive going forward.","Aaron Rakers","Fair enough.","William David Mosley","Yes, it depends on the portfolio pretty well, Aaron. You know trying to balance all the things we can for revenue growth and cash flow generations on.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, I agree. Fair enough. Thank you.","William David Mosley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Cihra from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Robert Cihra","Great. Thanks very much for squeezing in. I guess just a long -- long-term question -- sorry, not long question. The -- you obviously had great leverage from reducing costs and capacity and focus on to nearline. Where do you -- sort of, how do you drive the metrics in terms, I mean, at one point could you -- could see the lead only due enterprise drives and no client at all? I mean, but at the same time how do you manage that, but keep your scale economics? Thanks.","William David Mosley","Yes, Rob, I really don't think that\u2019s going to happen and we\u2019re seeing growth in some of the non-client compute markets, the surveillance in particular. Some of the edge devices, the burgeoning edge device, I mean, we might even classify gaming as that, video cashing at the edge is going to be a big market. So, as we look to balance all those things, like I said and to the answer to Aaron's question, we\u2019re going to try to grow revenue first and then balance cash flow. Could the market all become cloud, I don\u2019t think the demand will grow that big, but its growing pretty fast in the last couple of years. So if it could have been nice for us to be able to pivot to there, we\u2019re going to need more heads and disks and drive capacity and so on and so forth to do that. But I would hesitate to say that the other markets are winnowing away if anything, they\u2019re growing in exabytes as well.","Robert Cihra","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thank you.","William David Mosley","Okay. Thanks, everyone. I would like to again thank all of our customers, suppliers, partners and employees for a great quarter, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.

We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.","We recognize there is a lot of interest in learning more about Thank you. Seagate's strategic initiatives in the silicon memory market and a deeper understanding of our technology portfolio roadmap including our advanced work in areal density improvements with heat assisted magnetic recording. We've a few high level prepared remarks. However, the focus of our call today will be September results and we look forward to planning a strategic update for investors sometime in early 2018.","On our call today, we'll refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and\/or cannot be reasonably predicted.

Please go ahead, Dave.","Dave Mosley","Thanks Kate. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today.","For today's earning call, I'll cover the high-level trends we're seeing in the business, our CFO Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I'll close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.","Beginning with our operational results for the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28%, net income of $181 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29%, net income of $279 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96.","HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were a record 70.3 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record, 1.9 terabytes per drive, and the average selling price per unit was $64.","GAAP operating expenses were $481 million, down 17% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million, down 14% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million and free cash flow was $113 million.","At the end of September, Seagate announced our participation in this consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We are pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company.","Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we have always been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and the storage customers worldwide.","In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets.","Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be it HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions. This agreement has the opportunity to increase the potential for meaningful future revenue growth from Seagate's NAND storage portfolio while providing significant value for our storage customers.","We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future; however, we will not be providing further color on the details of the transaction until we are closer to the deal closure.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities.","Dave Morton","Thanks, Dave. For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage, with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive.","Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter two years ago.","The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments.","Over the next 12 months to 18 months, we expect a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from two terabytes to four terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we are well poised to help our cloud customers with our stringent and varied requirements.","Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10 terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent and we are confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes.","For the December quarter, we are planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows.","In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-terabyte, 4-terabyte and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals.","Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year, with exabytes up 75% year-over-year. Average capacity per notebook compute drive -- year-over-year. Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13% and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year.","We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we are focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for their rich gaming experiences.","Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our cloud systems and silicon group, in the September quarter was 242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year.","Our operating expenses for the September quarter were 481 million on a GAAP basis and 408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures.","We continue to identify areas for cost improvements, and during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately 20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately 50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately 400 million per quarter.","Capital expenditures were 124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY 2018.","Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was 237 million, and free cash flow was 113 million. These results include approximately 46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. For the December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least two times more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook.","Our balance sheet remains heavy \u2013 healthy, and we ended the September quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.","Interest expense for the September quarter was 61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed 166 million to redeem 5 million shares and 22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.","As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation.","We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms, including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings.","Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.","I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley. ","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Dave. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum.","Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products.","Over the last five years, we have been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019.","Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than six months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt.","We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model.","While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier.","Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends.","On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints, we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017. We are continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.","For the December quarter, we anticipate strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem, normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market and sequential growth in our Cloud Systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year.","Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year.","Gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost containment measures, as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal 2018; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially, with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs.","In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions-and-answers. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Edward Parker from BTIG. Your line is open.","Edward Parker","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about your exabyte ships. And it looks like the growth in the quarter was mostly from non-nearline, and so nearline has actually been down year-over-year for the past couple of quarters.","So, I recognize it's a really tough comp from last year, but I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically as to what you're seeing in that segment, what you're hearing from your customers and what type of exabyte growth you would expect over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Edward. Yes, it is a pretty tough comp year-over-year. I think, if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces.","We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so, some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017.","And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But to your point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back.","What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who still have yet to build out the scale.","But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of their suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good morning. I just want to follow-up on the enterprise segment. While there is a tough compare, exabytes did recover sequentially and the decline was less year-on-year. But you're seeing more aggressive pricing, both sequentially and year-on-year. So, can you just talk about how much of that is mix shift to cloud versus more aggressive pricing in the market? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Right, Katy, I'd say that there is mix shift going on. I'll let Dave talk about the pricing.","Dave Morton","Yes, I would classify any pricing you may see as more of a normal mix shift versus a like-for-like across consistent customers within that same channel. Pricing has been relatively benign. And so, to your point, as the exabytes continue to expand in this data rich area, pricing has not been a major factor across all of our nearline portfolio.","Dave Mosley","Right. Year-over-year, last year, we were talking about 8 terabytes. Now we're talking about 10s and 12s at the high-end. But especially back to Edward's question, the 4s and 8s now, even 2s, are very relevant in some applications in some of the smaller cloud players. So...","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.","Christian Schwab","Great. Thanks for taking my call great quarter. Can you -- as we talk about the cloud and the hyperscale and the increased offerings, which we're hearing about as well, do you have any changes in outlook for exabyte growth over the next three years versus what you previously thought?","Dave Mosley","I'd say, great question, Christian. The exabyte growth, as both the previous people have asked the question about, has been rather muted this last year if you look at it in aggregate. And some of that's driven by the cloud, some of it is driven by other dynamics. Long term, we think data's growing at 30% to 35%.","We've been talking about that fairly openly, but the fact that we're off to a trend this year, means that we'll get back on the trend in the future. Now how fast does it come back, some of that depends on the architectural nuance that I referred to earlier. Are people truly on to further architectures that they can deploy? Or do they still have parts in the system? And what's going on with their specific applications?","I actually think we're going into fairly healthy period of the growth that gets us back on to the trend line, and that's what's something we're trying to respond to. We can do it with higher and higher capacity drives because we have areal density to solution it.","Christian Schwab","Great. And then just one quick follow-up, just as far as you look at your solid state drive business and the broadening portfolio, obviously, with the long-term supply NAND agreement with the technology leader, are you guys prepared to give any expectations of how big that business could be in three to five years?","Dave Mosley","Not yet because, I think, to our points on the script, which I don't want to go into more detail on, I think it depends on exactly the natures of the deal. I will say that the work that we've been doing with customers means we have a lot of options. There are customers who really like our solutions.","I think our portfolio is a little too varied , actually, right now, too many interfaces and different solutions for our customers. I think we're going to have to make sure we pick and choose exactly which ones that we want to scale, but I think we have a lot of options.","Christian Schwab","Great. I don't have any other questions. Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, thanks guys. And congrats for a solid quarter. I would love to just get your take on, I guess, the conviction and then what would be the levers to get the growth margin over time to move back to, say, the midpoint of your range?","And then just I'll just make another one in there, too. Your share count, you continue to move it down. Is that opportunistic buying at these levels or should we think about a return to sort of share count to $250 million philosophy? Thanks, on both of this.","Dave Mosley","Yes. I think, from the margin perspective, to see exabyte growth go back, to Christian's question, I think that's the most relevant point. Obviously, 2017 or early 2017 was rather muted on exabyte growth. We think it'll come back. And on the share count, I'll let Dave answer. ","Dave Morton","Yes, the share count, it's back within overall capital allocation, the system that we've been working at over returning over 30% to 50% of our cash flow back to shareholders. And so, obviously, we've been fairly muted on our buybacks, which has been more a reflection of a NII dilution perspective.","But we're still very convicted in and around the 30% to 50%. And as we continue to see strength in our cash flows, obviously, we'll continue to be in the open-market.","Ananda Baruah","Awesome. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Rob Cihra","Hi, thanks very much. Two quick, if I could. On the enterprise, with mission-critical, I know it's been sort of declining for a while, but the exabyte shipment growth actually looks like -- or declines, I guess, picked up, looks like kind of declining with the low double digits. Is that now, do you think, the pace or do you think you can get that's more of us to a flattish exabyte business?","And then, I think, just quickly on cost cuts, OpEx coming down nicely. Is that -- are you still sort of cutting capacity and pruning portfolio or is it just more keeping OpEx percentage of revenue discretionary-type cuts? Thanks. ","Dave Mosley","So, I'll start with the enterprise side, mission-critical in particular. This market was one of the most impacted earlier in the year by some of the changes in build material pricings. To your point, we do see a mix up in there. Some of the lowest-capacity drives that we sell are on the order of 300 gigabytes. Those are impacted because some of those architectures are changing quickly. Mission-critical is actually a very rich, diverse space. There's not -- it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.","And we do see mix up to 1.2 and 2.4-terabyte type drives. And we think that, that'll have a long tail for especially for a lot of those workload-intensive applications that need that value. So, I don't think you're going to see significant exabyte growth, but you will see that mix in the longer tail. And then on the OpEx question, I'll hand it over to Dave. ","Dave Morton","In the OpEx, it's been too hard. We still have, I'll call it, some curtailing specifically in the portfolio when you look at some of our adjacent businesses. But then we also have just common items that we've been still trying to drive towards the lowest common denominator. So, we're still very much convicted on achieving the $375 million by the end of FY 2018, and I believe we're on a very good glide path to enable that.","Rob Cihra","Great. Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Good, I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.","C. J. Muse","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess a follow-up question on the nearline side. Clearly, you had a difficult comp from a year ago. But if I look at your outlook for calendar '17 in its entirety, it looks like that business is growing low to mid-single digits on an exabyte basis. Curious if you could kind of walk through what your outlook is from here?","And then second part of the question, on the enterprise side, as you look at Intel and the launch of Skylight, can you talk about how you see that core enterprise piece of the business flowing through from here? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Yes. Thanks CJ. I think we've talked about it quite a bit on the call. With the issues that there were earlier, that's why the year-over-year compare is pretty tough on the nearline space, with now higher capacity drives and ramping in the market and some of the markets, especially geographically turning on, some of the smaller cloud providers now seeing the architectures that they want to go invest in. We think that there will be substantial nearline growth into next year.","Now, obviously, our job is to turn that into orders as quickly as we possibly can, and we're out pursuing strategic agreements to go do that because these are large investments that these companies are going to have to make. But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective.","On the Skylight question, it's kind of interesting because we look back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, what does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?","This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interface and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, it does move to a different value proposition overtime, and that's consistent with the mix-up discussions that we had in mission-critical.","We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points and mission-critical as we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market but the mix will be high, so.","Dave Mosley","Okay. I would like to thank all of our customers, suppliers, employees for all their hard work on this quarter and all their partnership. It's been a very good back half of the year coming. In July, when last time we spoke to investors, things were pretty tough with the slow Q4. It's good to see August and September turning on, and we look forward to talking to you on the next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly lower than our expectations due primarily to expense control around the core business and commensurate with our revenue growth.","Capital expenditures were in-line with our expectations and inventory both internally and externally are within manageable levels.

We believe we\u2019re the first high-tech BBB minus company to issue a 20 year coupon which is a testament to the market's confidence in our management team, the strength of our technology portfolio and our financial and business policies.","Turning to our outlook, while we're generally optimistic about calendar year 2015 in terms of the demand for storage and overall economic activity especially that of the United States, we're tempered somewhat by the instability of the European business environment as well as the commodity and currency volatility throughout the world.","For example, Europe represents approximately 20% of our revenues and in retail we would have historically experienced an increase of about 5% revenue in the December quarter and in fact it declined by about 5%. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it's difficult to assess the degree of impact this will have on revenue and demand.","While Central Bank activity can alleviate some of the issues that are impacting specific country growth issues globally, these instruments are by design temporary and given the low level of interest rates we're now experiencing are by definition less effective at least on the measure of providing cheaper credit. While our forecasting continues to maintain a sense of caution due to these macroeconomic conditions, the trends we're seeing in the marketplace continue to align with our long-term expectations for exabyte demand and the growing need for economical and efficient storage.","Industry estimates for the HDD market demand are forecasting a seasonal decrease and we believe TAM will be approximately 135 million units in the March quarter. This is primarily driven by a seasonal decline in the client and retail market which is also expected to be the low quarter for the calendar year. The traditional enterprise market is estimated to follow seasonal patterns as well, although this market has been more resilient than we have forecasted over the last several quarters. The cloud enterprise market is estimated to be relatively flat, reflecting continued demand strength for high-capacity storage.","We anticipate the cloud market will exhibit relative strength throughout the calendar year as the acceleration which began last quarter continues. We're experiencing supply constraints in some key products for this market and we expect to be supply challenged for the next few quarters, based on current demand signals.","Pricing in the client and cloud enterprise market was slightly more aggressive than the December quarter than the five prior quarters. In some accounts we participated and in others we did not. As we look ahead, we believe this is a temporal issue related to specific industry conditions. Given the increasing demand trend from a broad base of customers towards the higher capacity products, we also believe this level of price erosion is unsustainable to fund the required capital and R&D investments needed in our industry.","We anticipate we will need to drive margin expansion at least towards the higher end of our long-term range of 27% to 32% to fund the long-term capital and R&D budgets related to the increased demand for cloud-based storage products.","Seagate's product portfolio is well positioned competitively in this demand environment and we expect to achieve revenue of at least $3.45 billion in the March quarter. We're planning our non-GAAP gross margin to be up sequentially and at least 28.5%, due primarily to seasonal product mix shifts, while also taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We're planning for operating expenses of approximately $570 million in both the March and the June quarters. These expenses include some increases in core R&D as we refresh nearly our entire HDD and SSD product portfolio this calendar year as well as investments in our new market adjacencies.","Based on customer engagements to date, we're encouraged that our value proposition for cloud computing is gaining traction and our revenue potential is likely greater than our original expectations. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors and suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support.","I'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. ","Aaron Rakers","Steve, if you wouldn't mind if you could go a little bit deeper into the commentary around the pricing environment and specifically to the enterprise space. You had suggested that maybe there was some temporal issues. Could you be more specific on what maybe you\u2019re seeing from a competitive perspective? And then also on top of that, how should we think about the constraints that you might be seeing in that space? And how that might translate to pricing on a forward basis? Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Well I think the pricing discussion can't be limited to just the cloud space. I think it's really a relationship between the cloud space and the client space. And the client pricing, even though it's quite low continues to be strangely aggressive and the reason I say strangely is that most of those components are low-capacity for the most part. You have a lot of single disc, two-headed products there. So you don't have a lot of cost opportunities.","And yet in a demand environment that's been volatile, relatively fell flat both in notebook and desktop if you take a one year perspective. There is not a lot of movement for absorption or cost reductions from especially the single part component companies. So, continued price aggression there kind of doesn't make a lot of sense, but there are certain market segments for example in retail where a couple of our competitors seem to be battling it to the end of who can have the last 0.5 point of market share. It's just been kind of silly.","It relates to the cloud market in that people can manage their overall gross margin, obviously, because the cloud products by virtue of their increased difficulty of manufacture and test, do carry higher margins. The reality is given the shift that we've had towards high-capacity we won't be able to match supply long term at these margin structures because the shift to high-end requires a lot more test, it requires a lot more heads of discs, they're harder machines to make and therefore we have to have margin structure\u00a0I think\u00a0in the 30% to 32% range to fund the mix change that we've seen already. The mix change that we're at is probably a year ahead of where we thought we would be.","So, I think we view it more holistically of what's happening across the portfolio and it just doesn't seem sustainable for the industry to continue like this. I think as it relates to your specific topic, Seagate does have some product leadership in particular categories. Where we're very constrained, that obviously relates to pricing that remains more firm. As I indicated, there is a couple of classes of product that we're effectively sold out through the rest of the year, subject to what we can do on the manufacturing side to increase supply.","So I do think that in the last few weeks we've seen some firming around the pricing on cloud, but I think the reality is, to really get the investment rates that we need long term, we're going to have to see an end of the erosion so we can basically rebuild the margin profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.","Benjamin Reitzes","Can you talk a little bit more about the client space? What are you seeing there sequentially? And with the weakness in desktops and some of the strong results in notebook and consumer, how do you see that playing out and impacting your business into the first half here? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","It's in flux. I think the whole balance between notebook and desktop has been interesting and dynamic over the last calendar year to say the least. We had a start of the year that had a lot of relative strength in desktop especially relative to what people were projecting and then the second half of the year really flipped the other way where the relative performance was on the notebook side.","I think as we left the December quarter we were I suppose discouraged a bit by the lack of momentum in the client space\u00a0which I think again, lends to some of the cautiousness that we're seeing as well as Intel's forecast was about 7% down on their revenue estimate and that's with the probably not nearly the pricing pressures we have.","So, I think the client space is a bit in flux. It feels for us right now that actually oddly enough, that maybe desktop demand is doing well already these few weeks in the quarter whereas notebook seems to be having troubles getting started, but I think it's just going to be this constant dance between the two.","And again, what you're probably looking at is relatively small growth, single, low single-digit percentages on a TAM basis through the calendar year and that just doesn't support the price aggression that we've seen in the market place. I think it's something the industry is going to figure out. And I think our supply chain is being pretty firm with us, that they just don't have additional costs to give us especially again if they're single-part providers to each platform.","Benjamin Reitzes","Okay. Just to clarify though, you think the pricing there gets better as we go throughout the year as well though?","Steve Luczo","I think the price erosion has got to stop.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rich Kugele","Let's talk a little bit about the cloud system side. I think you talked about it being ahead of where you thought it would be from a demand perspective. Any additional color you could provide? And how much did that weigh on gross margins in the December quarter?","Steve Luczo","Well obviously again, Rich, those class of products carry higher margins just because they're much more complex machines to build and test and develop, that business began to pick up a couple of quarters ago after as we know a few quarters of less than expected growth. We all talked about, was that a function of deployment? Was that a function of utilization rates? Or was that a function of time to deployment?","Our thesis was probably time to deployment and utilization rates and that there would be an acceleration, that's what I think we're seeing. I think the backdrop of end-user demand hasn't slowed and again, anything that's high-content video is going to drive more and more demand for that class of storage. So I think for Seagate, the portfolio is quite strong.","Our position in 6 terabyte is really good and we see a big demand profile. I think for a lot of the CSPs, especially the Top 15, they would almost take any amount of capacity per spindle that you could give them. If we had an 8 or a 10 terabyte drive, they would take it. They have software that knows how to manage that much data under a spindle now.","So as our portfolio shifts to that, I think we've had some relative advantage and that's helped the margin, but again the client space is aggressive and it all mixes up. I think the other thing to remember though is on our new businesses and I'm not sure this has been modeled well but I'm not sure that we've been probably able to give you as much detail to model it well. So, I'm not being faultful, but our cloud business is dilutive to gross margin, that's a business.","I think that we've described we're going to grow into the margin. We're adding revenue. We have really excellent confidence in the revenue profile going forward. If anything like I said, I think we're probably either on the June quarter call or we'll do it at the analyst meeting, we'll reset our revenue expectations. Again, that business comes in at a lower than corporate gross margin and we will grow into it. We will exceed the corporate margin when the thing is all fleshed out.","But I think that was probably a little bit heavier in the quarter than we would have expected and then the client pricing was a little bit heavier than we would have expected in the quarter. Those were the two main drivers offset as you point out by better margin from the higher demand for our cloud products.","Rich Kugele","And then what element of your manufacturing is the tightest to be able to produce the high cap cloud drives then? Is it test?","Steve Luczo","For the competitive reasons Rich, I'm not going to specifically answer that question, but let me say this way, that product has long lead times on wafer and it has a lot of test. So between wafer and test, you're looking at 20 plus weeks of supply chain that has to be managed. So if the customer set doesn't have that fully baked into their ordering system or if they are seeing demand increases that are inside those lead times, it creates a lot of stress on the system.","So what we're seeing now is a lot of stress on the system for the demand that we see this quarter and next, let's say. We can't really do much about this quarter unless we have yield improvements because you've either got a wafer issue or a test issue that's more than the quarter in duration. For next quarter we can start to line some things up. But it's really all the work we have to do for the September quarter and the December quarter\u00a0and of course for that, we have to go back to our customers and say these are pretty firm orders because we're going to do a lot of things to our supply chain to accommodate that demand which will impact our total portfolio.","So it's pretty dynamic right now and it's a good problem to have, but the lead times in this class of product, it's not like calling up and saying I need another million notebook drives. These are complicated machines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman","I had two, if I could. Steve, I want to just talk about a comment that you made previously about you thought that TAM in calendar year '15 would grow. If I look at the March quarter guidance, you're actually guiding to TAM to be down on a year-over-year basis. Where are the pockets of growth as you see 2015? Specifically, do you think as you get into 2015 that the client side on units actually grows?","Steve Luczo","I think over the course of the calendar year it does, probably low single-digits. Again, we believe March is probably the low quarter. Actually, for the first time in as long as I can remember, we're looking at from the customer demand-side, it looks like June quarter will be up versus March on the client side. Obviously, September and December are typically up as well. I think net-net, we will see a little growth.","I think the real issue is what's the nature of the growth and what's the class of machine that people are offering? I think the biggest opportunity the industry is going to see, I don't think it's a calendar '15 event by the way I think it's probably calendar '16 event, but there will be a smarter client. If we believe half of what we say about the value of the cloud, while it does talk to in some applications, a lighter client, it also talks to a richer client.","So whether or not that's greater compute or greater storage or greater bandwidth capabilities, especially for the knowledge worker and the value creator, these machines have to get more sophisticated not less. I don't think that's really been thought through completely. Things like Chromebook are gaining a lot of attention, but when you think about the use case of a Chromebook let just hope that's not where the world is going to check my email and weather and that's all I do.","I want more faith in inhumanity than that. I actually think we're going to see a big rotation in the client in '16, but I think in '15 it's probably going to be low single-digits and March is the low quarter.","Keith Bachman","Okay, well my follow-up relates to that Steve, if I could or Pat. In gross margin, you're guiding gross margins up sequentially, if you could review some of the puts and takes and what's the sustainability of that gross margin that you guided to given the comments you just made about TAM. And that's it for me, thank you.","Pat O'Malley","Keith, this is Pat. I think, as Steve even highlighted in the revenue we see some levers there that are more apparent to us that help us manage it that even with the lack of visibility and some of the segments we would like, we still feel confident that's growing. With the backdrop of that, we see where that revenue is coming from and how we model that. We feel pretty confident in this range.","As Steve said that range needs to expand and that's the backdrop of the erosion comments because the costs to deploy these are getting greater and greater. You see that in the gross margin and just as importantly is the OpEx, as we fundamentally refresh. I think we feel fairly confident on this gross margin and staying in this range, but that is on the backdrop that the erosion needs to slow down. The cost take-downs continue to happen, but you remember, these products are long in the tooth and that's why you see the OpEx with the refresh of almost the entire portfolio this year. So that's part of that as well.","The gross margin I think, it's modeled pretty straight and it's the classic, how much price you can afford to make these investments, that's where it's lining up and so we feel pretty confident we can hit these numbers.","Steve Luczo","We have good cost opportunities in front of us in some of the near-term things that we can do, but we're also having this portfolio roll on us which always gives us an advantage as we wrap up the yield curve. Again, Seagate is the only company over the last 20 years has consistently rolled the portfolio across the company. We're in one of those phases again.","It hits us a little bit on OpEx in terms of some of things that we have to do to prep the lines and things like that which these are one, two quarter events, but then you roll into a new portfolio and that gives us a lot of room. I think for the next couple of quarters we have underpinned cost take-downs that we're confident we can deliver relative to the shift in the portfolio and then after that, we get a whole new product line that's going to help us on both the HDD and the SSD side.","Then I think going forward, while that margin profile feels secure, my point was a little different. It's got to be higher than that though to maintain the level of investments that we need, if the shift to cloud versus client continues at the rate it is. I think that's the challenge for the industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Monika Garg","My question is more on the OpEx, if you look the OpEx guidance is on 16% [ph] you talked about related more towards refresh your portfolio and investment in cloud solution segment. So maybe if you look last 7 or 8 quarters, revenue is more like flattish on the quarterly basis. So maybe could you talk about all the investments we're seeing in the business, when can we see pick up in the top line? And the impact -- basic inflection in the revenue?","Steve Luczo","Yes we'll provide another update again, depending on where we're at on the cloud business off the June quarter certainly at the September strategic update. Basically, we're engaged with a few significant opportunities that I think will put us in position of changing that revenue forecast and to-date the growth has been strong. We're happy with the engagement that we have. Even just based on what we've done, we would probably be ahead of what we anticipated we were going to be either for Fiscal '15 or Fiscal \u201816, but there are a few opportunities that could change that in a more material way which certainly justify the tiny incremental investment that we're making in the OpEx side. Increasing the OpEx by $10 million to $15 million to get the type of revenue opportunity that we think is in front of us, we're quite confident is the right thing to do and hopefully we'll have more details on that, again, either off the June call or certainly at the September update.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Steve, with a consolidated market at inventory levels that has been quite rational the last year or so. What do you think is driving the pricing behavior? And does it suggest that we need even more consolidation maybe vertical consolidation in the industry? And then secondly, why not buy back more stock in the December quarter given the payment from WD came in early in the quarter?","Steve Luczo","Well I think in terms of the consolidation remember in the client space there is still five competitors. So a lot of people forget and I get it because of two of the entities owned by, if you will parent corps. But the reality is given the whole separate agreement that's been dictated by the Chinese government.","There are five competitors in the notebook space and in the desktop space, although Toshiba is maybe not quite as strong there as they are in the notebook space. So, I think until that gets resolved we're going to have this in balance and again it's just an economic dislocation of that. It will adjust one way or the other.","Secondly, I think in the retail space, there has been a battle between two of our competitors that just are refusing at this point to either give up share or not stop trying to gain share, at no matter what cost. We don't quite understand it, but that's okay. We'll just walk away from business where it doesn't make sense and redeploy our assets in the products where we can make more money. Again, that will end up creating a shortage which then will be self-adjusting somewhere down the stream.","In terms of vertical integration in the industry, it's an interesting point. I don't know that it's necessary from what's happening with pricing, I think the real issue is around continuity of supply under critical key components. And especially again those components that aren't gaining the value that we gain at the drive level of the shift to the high end. It's more heads and discs, that's our two most expensive areas for capital and R&D, if you take them together.","So we get the absorption we need with that shift, but if you're just selling just one part per device, it's a tough world when TAM is not growing and so that creates stresses on the supply chain that may need to either have tighter relationships in terms of the up and downstream suppliers or I guess theoretically could result in some types of consolidation in spaces that are critical components that either us or our competitors would worry about in terms of continuity of supply. So more to come I suppose in terms of how does that really play out.","In terms of buyback, I think we're still in the position that we were that when we had the last call and the stock was momentarily sub $60, we said at these levels we would be aggressive and that's still our position. We will buy for anti-dilution and then will be opportunistic about buying below there.","So we're thinking our buybacks over this fiscal year, next fiscal year and we want to continue to commit to return capital at the levels that we've indicated. So I don't think we're going to disappoint anybody on that front either in terms of the buybacks or the dividends or the total amount of capital that gets returned to shareholders and we'll be advantageous where we can. But I think, like we said before below $60 we believe is pretty attractive and then it's just a function of timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Steve or Pat, just in the context of the comments around getting the margins up to the 32% to 35% range to support cloud build and customer deployment in the second half of the year. What are the levers that you envision I guess taking place to create energy in that conversation? Should we have an expectation the margins potentially could go up in the second half of the year? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I don't know that we see an adjustment that quick or that it's needed that quick. I think the point is if the shift that's occurred continues at the rate it is then the margins have to adjust. So I think we believe the industry should be behaving with a better sense of the long-term needs on R&D and capital and what our economic models have to look like to provide that and I think in the last couple of quarters, we haven't done that as well as we should have given the demand profiles. I think we should certainly be trending that direction as soon as possible, but I don't think that means we get to the endpoint this year.","By the way, it also drives revenue growth. We keep talking about in the context of margin, but the reality is the industry should be exhibiting more revenue growth, given the shift in demand to the higher capacity and more complex devices and we're just not delivering to the extent that we should. So I would like to hope that certainly for the sake of the long-term health of the industry that we start making those shifts.","Ananda Baruah","Just a quick follow-up for Pat, if I could. On the OpEx guide, as you guys roll the portfolio over the next couple of quarters, how long should we expect those levels to be the sustained levels for OpEx?","Pat O'Malley","Well as the model sits today, you would probably see a roll-off coming in the start of fiscal \u201816, but as Steve said we have opportunities in front of us that will continue to course and guide that way, but as we sit here today you should see a roll-off of that starting in fiscal '16.","Steve Luczo","Think of it this way. We would generally manage our core flat and in the next couple of quarters, there is a slight uptick in core to again prepare some of the things we have to for the roll. So then we would expect that part of the portfolio to roll back to flat and then obviously, we go for leverage where we can there and that gets back to this dynamic around are we getting paid what we need to invest in the core products?","And then we have the adjacencies, whether or not that's the PCI business or the cloud business that carry a different load of expenses, but are also driving a different revenue profile. I think we all have to work together here over the next few quarters, as we manage the expense side and continue to try and provide you updates on the revenue and then we get more confidence.","At the end of the day, this model could be very different, but it would only be very different if we're generating the revenue growth and ultimately the margin growth that would sustain that type of OpEx increase.","Right now we're feeling pretty confident about that. So we want to make sure we continue the investments that Jamie needs for his business particular building the go-to-market capabilities, as well as some of the technical capabilities that are being put it front of us by a wide variety of customers whether they be OEM or end user or startups.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","I just wanted to ask you Steve, to remind us what your Exabyte growth expectations are for the business and thinking about the cloud Nearline Drives becoming stronger as we move through the year. How do you see that playing out in terms of year-over-year growth?","Steve Luczo","Obviously, exabyte growth on the consumer side is really high too. So depending on even the client products if you\u2019re looking at a certain segment in the consumer area that's a lot of 2 terabyte drives get eaten up there and 3s and 4s for some of the consumer at-home applications. So I don't want to not talk about desktop because it does drive a lot of high-capacity devices and in fact a lot of high-capacity devices.","In the cloud, there seems to be 4s will be the predominant capacity I would think. For the leading-edge companies, there is still a lot of 1s, 2s and 3s that are sold in the generation of cloud companies behind them whether or not those are private clouds or public and then the leading-edge ones are transitioning pretty quick to 6 and like I said, if we can make 8s and 10s, I'm sure they would take them. I look at it more, is where is the exabyte growth overall relative to areal density growth? And then also thinking about it in terms of absorption of heads and disc channel capabilities and test and all of those measures are still moving in a way that says we're constrained.","Whether or not you think of it as heads and discs or test time or lead times or complexity channel or exabyte growth relative to areal density growth, they're all ahead of areal density growth that the industry can provide right now. So I think that's the dynamic we think about long-term.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. Can I just ask quickly, I know we've talked about it a little bit but the TAM guidance was down 7% Q-over-Q after a pretty soft December quarter based on typical seasonality, it seems kind of high to me. We haven't seen that kind of decline since 2009. Just trying to understand what you're seeing that make you so cautious. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","We didn't say 7%, we kind of said, we think 135 million units. I had to rewrite that sentence. Sorry, I garbled it. We don't really know where December came in, is the issue and of course being the first reporter, it could be a 142 million units, it could be a 144 million units. Maybe when the dust settles in a couple of week, we'll know really. But depending on that range and depending on what your expectation is for TAM next quarter, it kind of talks to 5% to 7%, I'm not going to debate that and that's kind of where we think.","I think part of it is just again the momentum. December is always a tricky quarter because sometimes the momentum accelerates and sometimes it decreases and then sometimes that impacts what happens in the March quarter and sometimes it doesn't. So it definitely slowed down on the client side in December, that has us cautious and frankly the issues around currency and what's going on in Europe. I just think it's wiser to aim for the lower TAM and we can obviously leverage up a couple of million units pretty easily as an industry versus over-producing. And again, I have to look at the Intel midpoint and that's a company that doesn't have a lot of price pressure and they kind of guided down 7% on the midpoint of the range, so we have to take that as input as well.","Steve Luczo","All right, everybody thanks very much. Sorry we went over here a little bit and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin our quarterly overview, I\u2019d like to welcome Jamie Lerner who has recently joined Seagate and is our President of Cloud Systems and Solutions. Jamie is leading the integration of the storage systems business that we have recently acquired with Xyratex in addition to other cloud initiatives within Seagate. We expect Jamie to provide more details about these initiatives on next quarter\u2019s call.","Now, I will review the key figures from our fiscal third quarter. Seagate demonstrated solid execution this quarter achieving revenues of $3.4 billion, net income of $395 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.17. On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded gross margins of 28.5%, net income of $453 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.34. During the March quarter, we shipped 50.8 exabytes of storage and average 920 gigabytes per drive across our portfolio. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.7% and operating expenses were $470 million slightly better than our plan due to lower variable compensation and cost containment efforts. Inventory turns, days sales outstanding were within our targeted ranges.","We continue to manage our capital investments closely and our production cautiously and we are pleased with our performance against our metrics for manufacturing efficiency and operational excellence. For fiscal year \u201814, our capital investments are running below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue and it will most likely be below the range for the full fiscal year.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $443 million and free cash flow was $319 million. There were various reasons operating cash flow was impacted this quarter, some of which were non-recurring in nature and some front-end linearity. We expect to be back to our normal level of operating cash flow in the June quarter and we anticipate achieving operating cash flow of at least $2.7 billion for the fiscal year. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments.","We continue our focus on returning capital to shareholders. And during the March quarter, we returned $324 million, including $184 million to redeem 3.5 million shares and $140 million for a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share. We are planning for a similar level of cash return in the June quarter, which will keep us on track to exceed our shareholder capital allocation goals for the fiscal year. We are currently in the early stages of planning for fiscal year \u201815 and we will update our capital allocation plans on the July call.","We closed our acquisition of Xyratex on March 31 slightly earlier than planned. The addition of Xyratex will further ensure uninterrupted access to important capital equipment for our integrated supply chain and expand Seagate\u2019s storage solutions portfolio with their enterprise data storage systems business and high-performance computing business. We are in the initial stages of integration planning and we expect the acquisition to be slightly EPS accretive in fiscal year \u201815.","We continue to believe that this decade will be transformational in the amounts of data created as well as where and how data will be stored. The economics of storage infrastructures are changing as utilization of public and private hyperscale storage and open-source solutions are working to reduce the total cost of ownership of storage, while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage power. Growth in mobile, personal devices, video surveillance and big data analytics are all trends that we believe will continue creating significant demand for next generation storage systems and solutions.","Through our technology investments, we are aligning our storage product portfolio with these emerging trends, which we have categorized as mobility, cloud and open-source computing. We believe the significant investments we are making at the drive device level can bring even higher capacities, faster access time, increased reliability and improved overall efficiency to storage systems. Examples of these investments are reflected in the new products we introduced this quarter, including our 6 terabyte nearline enterprise drive, which is our highest capacity, self-encrypting product for server and storage systems and the fastest nearline drive on the market. We believe we will see a strong ramp for this product in the second half of the calendar year, as enterprise cloud customers continue to push for higher density drive technology.","Our seventh-generation surveillance drive, which can store over 500 hours of high-definition video, is specifically designed for the high right workloads of surveillance applications. It is estimated that surveillance cameras worldwide are producing over 400 petabytes of data each day. And we believe this market will continue to be a high growth opportunity for Seagate.","In addition, market interest for Seagate\u2019s object-based Kinetic Open Storage platform continues to grow across many industry verticals. We believe the Kinetic platform will be a fundamental underpinning for next generation cloud architecture and we continue to actively cultivate an ecosystem of system integrators and software developers. We plan to have further technology development and customer announcements later this year.","Turning to our outlook, the market environment in the tech sector remains dynamic with visibility somewhat limited. We therefore continue to plan conservatively for the near-term, while providing flexibility to meet importer upsides and make investments for the longer term opportunities we have discussed. For the June quarter, we are planning for revenues of at least $3.3 billion and operating expenses of $505 million, including the acquisition of Xyratex. As we just closed this acquisition, we are not modeling synergies assumptions at this time. Non-GAAP margins of approximately 28%, down slightly from the March quarter reflecting seasonality, market mix and with relatively stable pricing and maintaining overall market share of approximately 40% to 42%.","Our June outlook assumes unit demand to be down a few points with negotiated pricing having been relatively benign. The outlook also assumes Exabyte growth will be modest due to seasonality in the client and branded markets as well as due to a few specific temporal factors in the enterprise and nearline market this quarter. These factors include a few significant enterprise customers are absorbing in-house drive inventory and reducing disk drive purchases in the June quarter as they prepare for their new product introductions planned for the second half of the calendar year. And a number of cloud service providers have accelerated their time to deployment and have improved overall utilization and existing cloud infrastructures during the last three to four quarters, thereby absorbing their in-house drive inventory over the last two to three quarters. Based on current customer sentiment, we are planning for a stronger market demand in the second half of the calendar year as these entities deploy new build outs.","As we look ahead at the second half of the calendar year, we are anticipating the stronger seasonal demand in the client and branded markets that we have seen historically and for the temporal issues in the enterprise and nearline market to be resolved. Given these factors, we would expect market demand at the higher end of the range we have seen over the last several quarters with continued benign price erosion.","On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank our employees for their performance this quarter and thank our customers, partners, suppliers for their support and commitment as well as our shareholders.","At this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Please proceed.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions, I guess first just a follow-up, Steve on your last comment there on pricing, so your indications from conversations with the OEMs that you think that the second half if their demand profile plays out that you can maintain this or even a lower level of price erosion quarterly?","Steve Luczo","Yes, I mean if we break it down by market, Rich I think on the client side both notebook and desktop, those markets have stabilized I would say over the last year, I mean I think we have been pretty consistent in saying we thought it was kind of flattish market year-over-year. And it seems to continue to be so and I think for the rest of the year we are probably thinking the same, which would imply maybe low-single digit growth for the second half of this year relative to the first half, but flattish year-over-year. That pricing has been pretty stable overall. There has been shifts by the OEMs in terms of capacity points that they have been purchasing.","Nearline, I think has been aggressive in the last couple, three quarters and I just don\u2019t see those price erosions sustaining themselves, given the capacity points that we have to deliver over the next year, going from 6 to 8 to 10 terabytes, that\u2019s a lot of technical investment as you know, it\u2019s also a lot of test investment. And therefore I think that the margin profile on those drives is about where they can be in order to sustain the investment that we have to make going forward. So I would say that I would see a reduction in that price erosion to something close to what we are seeing on the client side.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay. And then just lastly I don\u2019t know if Jamie wants to handle this or Pat, but how should we be modeling the progression to neutral to slight accretion from Xyratex, how long do you think it will take to get to a more efficient operating model for that business?","Pat O\u2019Malley","This is Pat. Jamie could add color to it Rich, but obviously we haven\u2019t started the synergies. Jamie and his team and Dave and his team are working on the capital equipment group have already started that. I would imagine you would see incremental improvements quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we want to drive the top line growth as well and not just the OpEx, but I would expect you see OpEx reshaping over the next two quarters and start seeing signs of that in the P&L as Jamie reshaped the top line that will probably take a little longer.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","And will the Evolve business be rolled up into that entity?","Steve Luczo","Well, Jamie has responsibility for Evolve as well and we are going to through the work right now to figure out how they are going to integrate our Evolve business, Xyratex, our data center operations business and some of the business \u2013 some of the new efforts that we had focused on devices aimed towards hyper scale inside the both the product management and the design center, so all of that will be under Jamie.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please proceed.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Thanks for taking the questions. So the first question just to build on Rich\u2019s question on the Xyratex transaction. We actually build our models I have got a lot of questions around how we think about the gross margin of bringing Xyratex into the fold, relative to what Xyratex were to look like on a standalone basis to gross margin on that systems business. So maybe you can help us understand at least albeit early how we should think about that gross margin trajectory from that revenue stream and are you still targeting $500 million to $600 million in revenue for the first fiscal year of combined, that being in the model?","Pat O\u2019Malley","This is Pat. I think the $500 million to $600 million is where what we are targeting whether we can achieve that obviously we are engaging with customers has been pretty positive. So that would be the model we are aiming to, but even with that with the gross margins probably 10 to 20 basis points drag on overall HDD, but we would hope to even neutralize that as a year, but that\u2019s what we are modeling now.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about capacity shipment trends in the overall hard disk drive industry, I think obviously at 8% year-over-year growth that\u2019s a little bit off the pace that we saw outlined at the analyst event back in 2013 I think 26%. So maybe you can help us understand are we changing at all from that growth trajectory in terms of capacity shift are you still comfortable that that\u2019s a progression we are working towards?","Steve Luczo","I think we are still working towards that projection. I don\u2019t, it\u2019s an interesting discussion between capacity shipped versus capacity deployed. And I think \u2013 I usually typically think of it in terms of capacity deployed, i.e. end user demand of petabytes versus ability to deliver aerial density. And I do think that there has been a lot of inventory absorbed over the last six months as again on the cloud side as utilization rates have bumped and deployment times have been blocked down. And you know at least of one major customer that also kind of redeployed a bunch of drives into cold store or warm store. All those customers have kind of said that that one-time event or series of one-time events is kind of over and they were looking at second half demand that more reflects the end user growth in data. And their end user growth in data is actually, probably accelerated not decelerated over the last six months. So that\u2019s why I am still fundamentally encouraged by the overall delta, which is what\u2019s petabyte growth at the demand level versus aerial density growth and I still believe it\u2019s running two laps at least.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Okay, thank you.","Steve Luczo","Yes, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi, I think I just wanted to ask a quick question about your expectations for Xyratex in terms of how much revenue they add next quarter, I guess I would have thought the revenue would have ticked up some based on the benefit of having Xyratex in the business?","Steve Luczo","Yes, about $100 million, but it\u2019s really hard to say right now, because again you may have a big test business, which we now own and we have to kind of \u2013 we don\u2019t really know what the order profile of that business is going to look like yet. I mean, obviously their customers are still deciding which orders to place when and then of course we have to be able to fulfill those and that timing isn\u2019t completely understood yet either. So I think right now we are thinking about $100 million. I think you also have to recognize that the systems business was declining fairly rapidly over the last year. And the good news is, is that the traction with our OEMs has been quite positive in terms of their perspective on what they might do with us now that it\u2019s owned by Seagate, but of course, the lag time on that is fairly long as well. It\u2019s not like they are making order and we shipped it this quarter.","So, I think we have to recognize that those revenues were falling and we are kind offsetting the fall of that revenue as quickly as we can. So, all in all, I think about $100 million, which kind of speaks to a seasonal decline in the June revenue numbers for the HDD business. And then we will just see what happens with the test business, whether or not the Xyratex business picks up a little bit. Good news on the Xyratex business is they do a lot of the integration for some of the new storage architectures as well and we have seen a lot of encouraging signs from those customers buy Seagate\u2019s ownership as well. So, I think we just have to get a little more time under our belt to be able to be more articulate about what that revenue profile looks like and we hope to do that in the call for the June quarter.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Steve. And then I just wanted to follow up with a question about your expectations for PCs, you were generally pretty positive in your comments earlier about the PC market, but I think some people are concerned that maybe the XP refresh impact is starting to wane, so wanted to get your updated thoughts? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","In general, I think versus last quarter where it felt like business was getting some traction. And I was a little bit cautious about \u2013 but we are going to be really disappointed in April or May like we were kind of the last two cycles that\u2019s happened. I actually have to say that I am more encouraged in terms of what I think is going on, on a global basis in terms of economic activity and what that means for technology spending in general. So, I mean, I think that we are \u2013 we have stabilized the decline and I think we are going to see some modest growth across \u2013 really across all segments here going forward. June quarter is obviously, mostly always seasonally down except for when we have been recovering from floods or huge cutbacks by the industry. So, where we are at in June? I actually feel okay about and the back half of the year is we are starting to get some good indications from customers about stronger shipment scenarios.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you.","Steve Luczo","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please proceed.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions from me. First of all, I don\u2019t know if there is any more detail in terms of what the initial steps are that you guys had tackled in terms of integrating Xyratex, it will be great to get some more color on that. And then secondly, Steve, in terms of some of the temporal issues you mentioned, you did mention that higher utilization of HDDs. I guess is that something that we should think of as an ongoing impact of some new technologies, have been sort of ramped into some service provider capital models?","Steve Luczo","Not as I have heard the conversation, which has been directly with two of the largest CSPs that they are more. Again, I think people can understand that for the big CSPs today that are buying directly mostly from the drive industry, they are all employing very different architectures. I am not sure if we grasp this yet that those architectures are in fact their proprietary competitive advantages for the application set that they are serving. So, the Google implementation is very different than Microsoft\u2019s is very different than Amazon\u2019s and different than AWS\u2019 versus the rest of Amazon versus eBay. And what\u2019s happening is that as they are pursuing different architectures to achieve those application sets, they have breakthroughs every once in a while whether or not they are on how quickly they can get a server up and running and active with storage to how they get utilization rates and then in a couple of cases over the last couple of quarters, a couple of those really being providers have either dramatically pulled in time to deployment in one case, because I think they were probably not competitive and\/or kind of step function improvements and utilization.","The conversations are pretty much that I have had it pretty much some of those technical leads have pretty much concluded that that\u2019s it for a while. And then you know in another year or two maybe there is another step function change. I just think that\u2019s the nature of the business with those big CSPs that are calling multiple billions of dollars into their infrastructures. So, I don\u2019t think it was like some magic of some new technology. And by the way I wouldn\u2019t say it was disk drive related, I think it\u2019s overall system related that those are utilization rates and deployment rates that have improved, not just targeted towards disk drives. I think it\u2019s across the board.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just any other color on what are the first steps in terms of or you got to get a handle on with Xyratex?","Steve Luczo","I will let Jamie talk to it, because he has been into it the most.","Jamie Lerner","Hey, Steven, this is Jamie. I mean, I think we are thinking about the acquisition of Xyratex in terms of putting together both a technical architecture and a business architecture. On the technical architecture side, we are looking at ways and drilling in with our customers in the ways that we can combine the storage devices that we have into the enclosures and appliances that Xyratex builds. And working with our customers say, are there architectures that we can come up with that allow us to achieve synergies or technical breakthroughs by combining those technologies, essentially Seagate on Seagate methods. On the business architecture, we are looking at can we provide greater operations, manufacturing and logistics synergies between the disk business and the enclosure business to pull cost out of the model as well. So, we are working to do both those and next quarter we should be able to come back with a strategy.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great, that\u2019s all. Very helpful. Good luck going forward with that.","Steve Luczo","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions for me. One on the enterprise side, Steve you talked about a couple of the temporal issues that are impacting the enterprise business. It sounds like enterprise units both mission-critical capacity will be down sequentially in June. I am curious are we seeing incremental conversations about SSDs becoming a more of a replacement option on the enterprise side and if that\u2019s the any parts, especially for nearline drives?","Steve Luczo","No. Again, I mean, I just don\u2019t \u2013 the architectures aren\u2019t really about replacing HDDs. I mean, we have kind of been over this a whole bunch of calls. SSD deployment is about the acceleration and fast data processing. HDD is about storing data and they complement one another. So, it\u2019s not that architectural shift. What\u2019s happening is we have two big customers who are both about to release new products on the storage side, which are mostly HDD-based storage products for the second half of the year. And when they do that, they typically bleed down all the inventory they have inside of their company in various labs. And I mean, people don\u2019t realize the scale of what some of these customers do in terms of the drives that they hold for a number of years as they test these systems. And when they get to the end of a product cycle, they basically are able to flush through all that technology as they prepare for the next generation of technology. So, it\u2019s related to that.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. And then I guess the $505 million of OpEx that was mentioned for June, how much of that incremental $35 million is Xyratex centric versus some of the organic Seagate dynamics, can you kind of break that out? That would be helpful.","Steve Luczo","The vast majority of that, you could probably model in $40 million for Xyratex, $35 million to $40 million, almost all of it. You might have little puts and takes, but you just model all of it.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Steve Luczo","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks. How did the shorter cloud deployment times impact you order visibility? In other words, when will you have certainty around whether those orders come through, is it a few weeks ahead of time or is it months?","Steve Luczo","Well, kind of I\u2019d just associate to two things. It\u2019s not so much about visibility on orders, it\u2019s about how much inventory or how much are they guessing about what they need. So, I think, how I view it Katy is that we have way better alignment between supply and demand, because with the longer deployment periods, what was happening is that the customers were having to predict out in the future how much capacity they would need, server capacity, storage capacity, and they would buy all that and then sometimes they were right and sometimes they were wrong. And of course, being wrong is probably was really probably a really bad thing, because when they couldn\u2019t bring servers online. So, with the ability to deploy quicker just means that the forecast that we get are more accurate.","In terms of our ability to respond to that, that\u2019s a completely different dynamic which is actually becoming more challenging I think for the customers. And one of the reasons why we think some of these pricing issues are going to kind of have to stabilize is that, as you get to the 6 and the 8 and the 10 terabyte drives, the lead time on those drives is going to be pretty significant whether or not that\u2019s wafer-related or whether or not that\u2019s test related. And so you are not going to kind of be able to call up and say, by the way I need an extra 500,000 eight TBs I forgot to order, because they are just not going to be there and the industry can\u2019t respond that quickly. So I think we are going to get better linkage on supply and demand and I think we are probably going to get more accurate forecast because people are going to realize that the lead times on these drives are longer, much longer than they are used to.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. Any update on expected timing or results of MOFCOM deciding whether the industry can begin taking out costs?","Steve Luczo","I think Ken can talk to that.","Ken Massaroni","Yes, we continue to have a positive dialogue with MOFCOM regarding market dynamics that gave rise to the original conditions that were attached to the approval of our Samsung transaction. We are going to continue to have those discussions with MOFCOM and we continue to expect that in due course, the conditions will be released. But unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you it will be this day or that day. It continues to be something that they are paying close attention to and we will continue to cooperate with them on.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please proceed.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Few if I could, the first maybe for Pat, the second for Steve. Pat I believe last quarter you guys were talking about HDD related OpEx starting to soften at least as a percentage of revenue, in the June quarter you are beginning to drive some leverage and having some of that going forward, I was just wondering if you could give us some context around what to expect now?","Pat O\u2019Malley","I think you saw it manifest in this quarter where we basically went from the 4.90 plus down to the 4.69. So we started shaping that at the end of activities in December, which showed up in this quarter. We expect those to stay at the same level from an HDD level and all the increases from Q3 to Q4 are really driven by the integration or just the addition of Xyratex OpEx. As we look to integrate the organization, Xyratex we expected some synergies there. But many of the modes that we are looking to reshape right now and on this reshaping deployed obviously with Jamie\u2019s initiatives to drive cloud we will make the appropriate level of investments there with the SSD appropriate level there. So probably we are going to stay at the high end of that 12 to 14 for a period of time with the expectation to drive revenue growth with those investments. But for the short period of time in that high end of HDD and then we have to figure out how to integrate Xyratex. As Steve said Evolve and look at the whole holistic picture and say how do we reallocate that, but it\u2019s going to be at the high end of the range. And we will \u2013 as Steve talked about the capital allocation we will talk further about the OpEx model for \u201915 as we finalize our plans going into next year.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Yes, thanks Pat. That\u2019s really helpful. Steve can you just \u2013 just a follow-up for you on your TAM comments with regards to the second half, should we expect I guess you said sort of a high end what current quarters have been, should we expect September and December to be sort of towards the high end of what sort of recent quarters have been which should be more in the 1.42 range, are you saying September quarter will be sort of at the high end of what recent September quarters have been and December quarter at the high end of what recent December quarters have been, just a clarification there? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Sorry I was trying to be confusing. I think we think that September and December are probably in the 1.40 to 1.45 range.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I understand the weakness in the enterprise, but can you discuss the initial uptake of your new 6 terabyte drive by the cloud providers? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Rocky Pimentel","Hi, this is Rocky Pimentel. So the 6 terabyte drive is in late evaluation with the customers and we see clearly very positive response from all the cloud customers there. They are definitely interested in higher capacity, higher density per drive products and we have done some really good engineering work on that product. We think it\u2019s a real value leader in performance and design margins, so we are pretty optimistic about how it\u2019s going to play in the marketplace when we start production shipments probably towards the back half of this quarter, but certainly building strongly as we go into the second half of this current calendar year.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Okay, got it. And then I know you will update your capital allocation next call, but can you tell us how much cash you need on hand to run the day-to-day operations and what\u2019s your appetite for taking on more debt to maintain the current level of repurchases if needed?","Pat O\u2019Malley","We think we have the appropriate level of leverage, we certainly could take on more leverage, but we look at that leverage more as monetizing it through investments in business. So I think returning the level of capital we did has been appropriate for where we have been in the investment stage of the company, so we are still committed to our dividend and growing the dividend. And we will continue an active buyback program, but we want to look at everything that\u2019s available to us. So we will monitor that and like Steve said, we will come back in July with further updates on that, but we will \u2013 certainly will continue a buyback and a dividend program. And with the debt like I said, I think the levels we have today even though we have the capacity for some additional debt, but I think the levels are fine today.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","And then the minimum cash level?","Pat O\u2019Malley","I am sorry minimum cash level, $1 billion to $1.5 billion we could run the business at that level. I am more comfortable with $1.5 billion for strategic elements that may pop themselves up, but we feel comfortably at the $2.3 billion that we have plenty of cash to run the business.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of first on the September and December time, which you talked 1.40 to 1.45 range, maybe could you elaborate which particular segment you see the more pickup for the demand?","Steve Luczo","I think it\u2019s across the board.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. And then you kind of talked about some inventory digestion at your customers at enterprise and hyperscale, do you think it is possible that you are seeing the pause, because people are waiting for the 6 terabyte drives or it is more to do with some products at their end?","Steve Luczo","No, this has to do with your own products.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, just kind of the last one on the NAND side, maybe could you kind of talk about the NAND strategy, do you think you need any more M&A in this field or do you think you would like to grow the business more in-house? Thanks.","Rocky Pimentel","Hi, this is Rocky Pimentel. On the NAND side, certainly, we have our organic efforts on SSD, but as we have said in the past we are definitely always on, looking at the inorganic activates we can do, whether it\u2019s acquisition or investments. So we continue to have a pretty disciplined filter, but needless to say we see ourselves pushing forward the initiative from both an organic and an inorganic standpoint.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Pat I was wondering if you can go over the OpEx again on the quarter because it came in a bit better than you guys have thought originally, you mentioned cost containment, given you expected some of the comp stuff to go away, so is there anything specific you guys are doing on the cost side that perhaps continues moving forward here. And then secondly, just a clean up item on our models on the tax rate, there was a credit there as opposed to an expense, can you help us understand what that was and is that something that is more one-time in nature? Thanks.","Pat O\u2019Malley","Yes, so starting backwards on the tax there was some tax adjustments every periods from time-to-time, audit periods expire with time, so you just \u2013 you take a look at that and you make the appropriate level of adjustments. So that was a $14 million one-time item, that\u2019s why I think claiming the tax rate of about $60 million on a go forward basis, spread equally through quarters is probably the best model for that. On the OpEx were some actions of reshaping some of the activities throughout the company. We had some cutbacks over the last several months. So we certainly reshape some investments through actions inside the company and then through slowing down some investments on pieces we talked about SATA 4 SSD where we thought that wasn\u2019t probably the appropriate place, so you saw some expenses come of there. So it was looking across the board, not just core, but some of these new investments where we thought the best chances if we get the adequate level of return on investment. And so that was done, that activity will continue to keep ourselves flat through on the HDD for Q4 the June quarter and as Steve and Jamie talked about from a business process we will continue to look to how to integrate further and maybe harbor some of that, but like I said probably with the appetite to redeploy in other areas. So, I would like I said model that high in the 14% and we will get more clarity on the Xyratex, Evolve everything else optimization in the July timeframe.","Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Pat O\u2019Malley","Sure, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Hi, thanks. With the weakness in enterprise, I am curious, Pat, if there is an impact, a noticeable impact on gross margin for not just on a mixed basis and if so how much?","Pat O\u2019Malley","We already gave you our gross margin outlook of 28%.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Yes, I am sorry. So, talking to just to clarify talking to the current weakness we have seen over the last couple of quarters, is that driving a noticeable level of weakness in the companywide consolidated gross margin that you are reporting?","Pat O\u2019Malley","Yes, enterprise drives have higher gross margins in the corporate average.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Okay. And then maybe just on market share, with the big swings in enterprise and the downside in client, especially desktops and the upside, is there anything you would like to note in market share that\u2019s been happening over the last quarter?","Steve Luczo","No, market share has been pretty consistent for the last four or five quarters. Maybe if I think back the last six quarters, I think the biggest swing in market share has been a couple of points overall. I think half a point shifts here and there are kind of to be expected then those are seem to be mostly a function of either product gaps from either us or the competitors or maybe someone has access to a customer that happens to be doing better and sometimes that advantages us and sometimes it advantages one of our competitors. I would say the only kind of significant trend if I think back over six or eight quarters is that Toshiba has picked up a lot of share on the branded side, which was done through relatively aggressive pricing three or four quarters ago and that seems to have been resolved in the last couple of quarters as well. So, no, I don\u2019t see any huge market share shifts, some at the fringe, but that\u2019s mostly either product related or maybe something specific customer related.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Okay, helpful. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Good, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Cihra with Evercore Partners. Please proceed.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners","Hi, thanks very much. Two questions as well if I could. One on just your internal head in media, mostly the head side just that without, not so as far number, but just where you are now and if you think there is that\u2019s changing over the next couple of quarters in terms of more internal head mix or do you think it will stay similar? And then on the enterprise side, I know it\u2019s been picked apart 50 times, but out of the 7.7 million enterprise units, if you could give us any kind of mix between mission-critical and nearline and all the dynamics you are talking about, Steve, in terms of the OEM product cycle than a hyperscale, I assume is applied across both mission-critical and nearline or are they kind of mostly mission-critical on the OEM side and mostly nearline in the hyperscale side? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Let me answer that before forgetting and Dave can talk about the sourcing stuff. Yes, the most of the mission-critical stuff is I would call legacy system, which is obviously still an enormous market and that\u2019s where you see a big rotation on the architectures, the new product offerings from a few of the customers that\u2019s causing kind of the soak up in the inventory that they have in the house. And then the deployment and utilization rate stuff that we have seen over the last few quarters has been mostly on the hyperscale side. That can show up either in the OEMs or it can obviously just show up directly to the drive companies and to the server companies or the white box server companies, because as you know, the CSPs for the most part are buying direct although from time-to-time, they are still buying through certain OEMs. So, there is a more of a mix on that side of whether or not it\u2019s impacting OEMs or if it\u2019s impacting the component industries directly.","Dave Mosley","And Rob, to answer your question on the heads internal versus external, we are fairly happy with the mix, also the technology access that we are getting across various platforms. So, right now, I don\u2019t foresee any changes in internal versus external strategy for the coming few quarters.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners","Alright, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Technologies Insights. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thank you. I got a couple of questions. First is to pick apart guidance a little bit more, $3.3 billion includes about $100 million from the Xyratex. So hard drive operations revenue, it sounds like that\u2019s about $3.2 billion, so probably about 6% Q3 decline on hard drive revenue. Could you help parse out the two factors that you have cited, the inventory correction and the seasonality?","Pat O\u2019Malley","So, on the inventory correction, that would probably be\u2026","Steve Luczo","The seasonality is usually 4%, yes.","Pat O\u2019Malley","Right. And the inventory correction would be the other piece and probably the bigger drag on the margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, okay very good. And my other question is on the branded that has had two consecutive quarters of core unit growth, but more importantly two consecutive quarters of ASP growth. So, the question is are you seeing this growth coming from higher ASP offerings, and more importantly, where is this mix shift at this point in time and where do you think it will go two years from now?","Rocky Pimentel","Hi, this is Rocky Pimentel. Yes, I think we have been pretty pleased this last quarter with the execution on our retail side. And that is a mix to higher product, higher capacity products, particularly our momentum built in the 2 terabyte category in the channel. So, we continue to see higher capacity products playing a bigger role in the mix as we go out over the foreseeable future in the branded side as well as the emergence of more NAS centric products in both the small, middle \u2013 small, medium-sized business as well as consumer NAS.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks. Looking at the demand outlook you discussed, how should we think about exabyte shipment growth in the second half of the year given that the strength I believe you said was going to broad-based across the segment?","Steve Luczo","Yes, I think it\u2019s going to accelerate. I think what I said is I expect growth across all segments, but I do think that on a relative basis, the growth will be better on the nearline side, where it\u2019s been pretty flat the last three quarters. So, I think we are going to see some exabyte growth acceleration. And keep in mind obviously on the client side, we have large capacity types, through lots of people gobbling up one and two and three terabyte drives on notebook and then two, threes on desktop. So, it doesn\u2019t really hurt you so much even if you get it on notebook and desktop, but I do think the weighting will be more towards nearline mission-critical.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful.","Steve Luczo","Thank you.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Second question on MOFCOM, can you remind us of the potential benefits you would expect to see if all the restrictions were lifted and obviously we don\u2019t know how it will play out, but just how are you thinking about that today?","Pat O\u2019Malley","Yes. Obviously for Seagate, it was \u2013 we picked up a product line, we picked up a good engineering team that would still utilize post MOFCOM and continue to invest there, but if you take a look at the total operating synergies on the OpEx, you could make that case for $40 million, like I said what would we do with that, whether we redeploy it, but that will be probably a magnitude for us. And then obviously just giving us our customers would like to have one access point. So, the customers would prefer it as well. So maybe customer set and that yields something, but from an OpEx about $40 million.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Steve Luczo for closing remarks.","Steve Luczo - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, just want to thank everybody for being on the call today.

My name is Kevin and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to today's call. Joining me today in the room from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO and Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Dave Mosley, President and COO is connected into the call remotely and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group is not on today's call as he is traveling.","We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2016 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call we'll review the highlights for the June quarter and fiscal 2016, provide the company outlook for the first fiscal quarter 2017, and then open the call for questions.","We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the investor section of our website.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kate. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business and the direction we will be taking with the company with respect to structure and focus, and Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial highlights and I'll close the call with our guidance for the September quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016.","For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.65 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 25.8%, net income of $207 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter were $443 million. Capital expenditures of $146 million for the June quarter were higher than our previous forecast due to our decision to accelerate the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. In addition, we are accelerating the expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the plan manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites. For the full fiscal year, our capital expenditures were $587 million, approximately 5% of revenue and below our targeted long-term model range of 6% to 8%.","We believe Seagate's June quarter results are reflective of a generally stable but relatively benign macroeconomic environment as well as an acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Demand from cloud service providers was stronger than expected after several quarters of relatively modest demand from these customers.","Our HDD shipments for the June quarter were 36.8 million units, representing a record 61.7 exabytes of storage. Average capacity per drive increased to a record 1.7 terabytes per drive and ASPs of $67 were a record since the Thai floods. Overall inventory levels were down 6% sequentially and within this, finished goods were down 21%. These inventory levels represent sequentially improved inventory turns and lean production schedules as we ramp our new HDD products throughout the portfolio.","With respect to our cloud systems business, we are making good progress in ramping new platforms and gaining new customers offset by some demand softness from top-tier OEM and government customers. The integration of Dot Hill is complete and we will be launching converged storage platforms, including hybrid and all-flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition.","On the silicon side, we have recently introduced a number of new products including our industry-leading 2 terabyte NVMe enterprise SSD product which is getting positive customer feedback. This business is extremely competitive and we're working in construction with our key NAND partners who are enabling us to develop workload-specific and optimized products.","For the fiscal year 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $11.2 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $684 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.26. In fiscal 2016, we shipped 233 exabytes with average capacity per drive up 29% year over year. Within these results, we shipped 70 exabytes for the business-critical product portfolio, up 28% year over year.","Consistent with our expectations of the impact of the shift from client server to mobile cloud architectures, Seagate's HDD unit shipments over the last five fiscal years have decreased 15% while at the same time exabyte shipments have grown 112% and average capacity per drive has increased 133%.","Applications which require higher capacity HDDs are responsible for the record demand for HDD storage. Additionally, these application trends align with the Seagate actions that are in progress to optimize utilization in our heads, media and drive-test factories. Since the majority of exabyte growth is related to high-definition streaming content where massive data ingest and sequential write operations are the key characteristics for the specific workloads, HDDs continue to be the optimal cost performance solution over any other storage device.","In the nearline enterprise market, our 8 terabyte products were the fastest growing products in units and revenue within our overall HDD portfolio this quarter. We expect the market to continue to shift towards this capacity point over the next two years.","Our 10 terabyte helium enterprise product is best in class for power performance and we will be shipping our 12 terabyte helium nearline enterprise test units for customer evaluation this quarter. To meet the high capacity storage requirements of the client marketplace, we have recently introduced 10 terabyte capacity points across our Guardian Series client portfolio with particular focus on the surveillance, gaming, DVR and NAS markets.","Over the next several quarters, we will refresh most of our high volume capacity points in our portfolio with lower cost designs using our leadership in areal density and our improved operational footprint. Our customers will benefit from the portfolio advancements and we believe that Seagate will be in the leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low capacity, units-based demand profile to the future applications which are component rich and require aggressive technology advancement.","This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments. While we expect this shift to continue to pressure PC unit volumes with HDDs, we are encouraged by the capacity needs of the remaining PC client as well as the significant growth in non-PC-client devices and applications.","Assuming a relatively stable macro environment, we believe that given the continued shifts in our product revenues as well as recognizing the full impact of the significant changes in our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will achieve revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability.","I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on these activities.","David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial model that were impacted in FQ4. I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking to manufacturing and operating expense levels.","For the June quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our 8 TB nearline enterprise products were our leading revenue SKUs as overall ACD enterprise revenue increased to 45% of our total HDD's revenue. By comparison, our PC client shipments were 25% of HDD revenue in the June quarter, reflecting the shift of client server storage environments and our strategic participation in the higher-capacity segments.","We continue to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low-capacity notebook and gaming market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate's HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.","As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand and changing nature of our customer base, we are continuing to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint and we are reducing our capital expenditures to maintenance capital requirement levels, which is expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year. Through these actions, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity and our operating philosophy will shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity.","Earlier this year, we began the process of reducing the HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately 55 million to 60 million drives per quarter to approximately 35 million to 40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next six to nine months. At the same time, we are continuing to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories, internal head and media facilities.","Towards our infrastructure cost alignment, in the June quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $80 million in pre-tax charges and additionally in July, we announced further cost reduction activities reflecting $164 million in pre-tax charges. Overall restructuring actions are proceeding as planned and we expect the financial benefit of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter.","For the June quarter we recorded a tax benefit of $16 million. This is primarily related to the release of tax reserves and changes in our deferred taxes in foreign jurisdictions, impacted by our global footprint changes. Our overall fiscal year 2016 tax expense was $26 million. While we are still formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profit, we believe the new high capacity and cost-advantaged products in our full HDD portfolio refresh and overall cost alignment activities we are implementing will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017.","Given current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in exceeding the minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017 that we indicated last quarter. We recognize that we are on track to exceed this goal and will provide additional insights for calendar 2017 on our October earnings call.","Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $269 million, and for fiscal 2016, we generated $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the June quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 299 million shares outstanding.","Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.","I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dave. As we manage the business in the near term, we are cognizant of the recent published earning results and related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology industrial markets, as well as many consumer products companies.","As indicated, demand for our nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and\/or replacing HDDs that are in service. We expect this demand to be relatively flat in the September quarter. We see growth in some areas of high capacity non-PC clients, specifically DVR, surveillance, NAS, and seasonal gaming demand, offset with declines in the PC-related markets as we narrow our participation in this segment.","Overall, I expect demand should improve in the September quarter with our focus on high capacity opportunities for our portfolio. Based on these factors, we expect revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the September quarter. Given the dynamic nature of the technology business as well as a still tepid macroeconomic environment, we have approached our outlook cautiously. We expect to achieve revenues of at least $2.7 billion in the September quarter, with gross margins of at least 27%, and relatively flat operating expenses.","We believe it's important that investors recognize the continued shift from client server to mobile cloud, and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional customer base, while also creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base.","The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies, and will likely include corporate demand in the not-too-distant future.","As a result of these changes in product demand and customer base, we have experienced shifts in our traditional seasonal demand patterns. Cyclicality associated with cloud infrastructure buildout can now override seasonality, and this has implications for investors' expectations and management of our company resources.","While the overall shift in technology deployment and related growth in data science applications is quite favorable for the HDD industry on a moving annual average, the rate of growth for storage demand in the near term will likely fluctuate quarter to quarter as major systems installations either aggressively deploy or absorb capacity.","As we analyze these trends, we are considering that these changes in customer buying patterns and capacity utilization may be better reflected in annual guidance planning for investors. We will discuss this possibility with our investors over the next few months.","In addition, we continue to implement actions to align our manufacturing footprint and operating expense investment with market demand. These actions, as well as the product portfolio introductions previously discussed, should result in continued gross margin and operating margin improvement over the near term. Should there be improvement in the overall macroeconomic conditions, we would expect to see improved HDD unit demand across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's financial performance.","Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we can now open it up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Just thinking about the restructuring actions you've taken, you've taken a number of actions over the past quarter. Are you done with the restructuring actions? And how should we think about OpEx as we move beyond the September quarter? Should we start to see that trend down because of the actions, or is it still going to stay about flat?","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're not done. And in terms of OpEx, I think for the next one or two quarters, it'll be relatively in this range, Sherri, and then it should reduce afterwards.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I know you said you'd comment on the $2.50 in October, but it seems like at least at these levels, you're well ahead of that $2.50. Do you have any thoughts for what the earnings power could be as we move into fiscal 2017 and calendar 2017?","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're starting to get a sense of it, and to your point, obviously we're confident that the $2.50 will be exceeded. I think until we start kind of getting a better sense on some of these demand patterns on the CSPs, we just want to get a little more data under our belt before we give you a more specific number. But to your point, we're confident that it'll be materially different than $2.50 a share.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. First, congratulations on the balance sheet. It's good to see those turns. Just in terms of your comment about cyclicality overcoming seasonality, that's interesting. When you look at the cloud service provider market, do you find that they tend to be more accurate if you look at it over six months versus a quarter? And also, about the qual cycle there, do you see the 10 terabyte and other high capacity products like that getting qualified quicker in the future? And would that help improve the visibility as well as you move out to 12 and other terabytes? Thanks.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say that the visibility over a year by quarter isn't great, Rich. I mean I think they have a decent sense of what they think they need in terms of capacity deployment on an annual basis, but when it breaks down to quarter to quarter, I think given the nature of the customers, many of them aren't actually witnessing centralized perspective of demand. So there's a bunch of BUs that are deploying, and a lot of those BUs actually buy on their own. Some of them go to a centralized deployment; some of them don't. So you can't think of these big CSPs necessarily as holistically planning capacity for every one of their application sets, because a lot of those business units within those companies are on their own cycles and maybe it gets aggregated, maybe it doesn't, depending on the customer.","So I think they're all learning. I think what's going to drive the better visibility is just the lead time associated with these products, and we've already seen it with the ATB. As you know, the wafer cycle times on the heads are longer than the quarter and then the test times are three weeks on top of that. So you're well outside of a quarter in terms of lead time. So if you don't do a great job of your capacity planning in advance of a quarter as a CSP, and you don't have excess capacity, you're going to be somewhat constrained, especially as they move into these spaces where they could see big step function changes in demand, i.e., they pick up a big corporate customer that's going to a huge cloud-based installation of applications, let's say. If they don't have the capacity in place, they can't take that business.","My guess is if they miss one piece of business like that once, all of a sudden the planning's going to get a lot better. And we've seen that. Those trends are starting where you have these Fortune 50 or even Fortune 20 companies that are now making big moves to the cloud. And that puts on basically sometimes pressure of, we need a whole new data center. And this is the beginning of the trend, not even the middle or the end game. So we expect a lot more of that.","So the lead time, and the lead times of course with the 10 terabyte are longer and the 12 terabyte are long just because against the complexity of the technology. So your process content is way higher and of course, the test time is way higher. So I think in general, their views aren't bad on a looking out over 12 month basis. It's just their quarter to quarter visibility is still developing.","In terms of 8s, 10s, 12s, we think the 8s are going to be around for a long time. It's super high performance and very lost cost product for us. 10 TB, we certainly have customers that are taking the drive. We don't know that we see a huge uptick in 10 TB just because you're only picking up 2 terabytes and it costs a lot more right now. Maybe as the two companies get up the yield curve and bring cost down, we'll see an acceleration of the deployment. That's what we noticed on ATB, that once you got up the yield curve and in our case, because we have a disk and two heads less, we were able to hit cost points that really accelerated the replacement of 4s and 6s with 8s.","So whether or not it's 10 or maybe 12 where you pick up 50% more capacity or frankly, maybe even 16 where it's I'm doubling capacity in that same real estate, it'll be interesting to see where that transition happens. I think the important thing is to make sure from a Seagate perspective that we're leading in areal density and we continue to deliver that in our products. And whenever the customers decide they want that product, we'll be there with it.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks. And, Dave, just on the free cash flow, if you fast forward nine, 12 months, are you confident in the company's ability to generate $1.5 billion type of cash flow?","David H. Morton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think what we've laid out with a lot of our restructuring activity as well as where we're just relying and defaulting on maintenance capital and how that has come down compared to previous years, the trajectory that we're on would suggest that number.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. Take care.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks you for taking the questions. And hey, congrats getting the confluence of these actions to come together pretty quickly in a nice way. Steve, just a couple for me real quick. I just love your context around second half, specifically second half CSP cycles. Sounds like you saw a little bit of a greater than expected pickup in June. How long do you expect that to last? And then we'd just love your current thoughts around kind of the longer term normalized exabyte growth. And I'll actually squeeze my last one in. Just any thoughts you have on September Q TAM. That's it for me. Thanks.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah again, the CSP influence on the overall business is a little tricky just because like we witnessed in this quarter, can be so kind of significant. And when they do start buying, they tend to start buying for longer periods of times, two, three, four quarters. That really hasn't been modeled into our expectations. We'd rather kind of see the whites of their eyes before we make that call.","We can say that July started off quite strong and the demand seems to be fairly solid. But as I think most of the analysts know, typically the September quarter is a back-end weighted quarter. And if we overlay the back-end weighted quarter on what we've seen so far, it kind of doesn't make sense to us. So we've been a bit cautious and then we'll see what happens with that demand. And again, I think until that customer base diversifies a bit more and we get I think more data around what happens month to month in addition to quarter to quarter, it's probably better for us just to be cautious about what we see and then be smarter as we move forward. What was the second question?","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","The annual.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I still think the annual demand for storage is still probably more defined by available capacity than it is real demand. I mean again, if you take population growth times connected devices times richness of content, it gets you easily to three or four zettabytes by 2020, which would imply kind of 30% to 35% annual growth in storage. And I still think that's really kind of what the demands is, and the question is can the HDD industry or the NAND industry for that matter invest to those levels of capital or not. And we'll see. It's pretty tight though, given the budgets that people have deployed or the fabs that are lined up.","But I still think you're seeing exabyte demand that's well in excess of areal density demand, so in that sense we view it as demand's outstripping supply. And then of course the packaging requirements are moving to more high capacity, so more heads and disks per units, but units probably flattening out. But from an absorption perspective for Seagate, making heads and disk or because the process content is so much higher or the test content is so much higher, that's a really good trend for us.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Thank you. And just real quickly, September Q TAM thoughts.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of unit TAM?","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Unit TAM, yeah.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're not actually that focused on unit TAM. Again, we're more focused on exabyte. We've heard the 110 million number from our competitor, and on the face of it, that probably seems reasonable. That's not probably a TAM we see visibility to, because we're not participating in the low end of that segment and there's obviously a lot of units there, especially in the gaming market. But it doesn't seem unreasonable to us.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Thanks for all the context. Appreciate it.","Stephen James Luczo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, market's opening so we should probably wrap it up, everyone. We appreciate your support and thanks to our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and we'll talk to you in three months.

My name is Melanie, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick","Good afternoon, and welcome to today's call. I'm joined today in Cupertino by Seagate's CEO, Steve Luczo; and CFO, Pat O'Malley. Dave Mosley, our Executive Vice President of Operations, is joining the call from our Singapore offices. Other members of our executive team are traveling today and will be unable to join the call.","We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal fourth quarter and year-end 2012 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, Steve will review the highlights from the June quarter and provide the company's outlook for the fiscal first quarter 2013. After that, we'll open up the call to questions.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to the company's historical and currently anticipated future operating and financial performance in the September quarter and thereafter and include statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen J. Luczo","Thank you, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Kate mentioned, we are in 2 locations today. Pat and I are in Cupertino, and Dave is in Singapore. We've just celebrated the 30th anniversary of Seagate's Singapore operations. It's been an honor to be such an important part of the business transformation of this leading industrial country, and we thank all the employees, community members and government officials who have played such an important role in Seagate's overall success.","Seagate's fourth quarter and year-end results reflect the overall strong operational performance by the company and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. In the June quarter, we achieved record revenues of $4.5 billion and record shipments of 66 million units, which represented an approximately 42% market share.","We had very strong profitability with non-GAAP net income of $1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.41. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%. Fiscal 2012 revenues were $14.9 billion, with non-GAAP net income of $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.75 and non-GAAP gross margins of 31.7%. We also achieved record operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in the June quarter, and we returned over 90% of our operating cash flow for the quarter to shareholders in the form of dividends and share redemptions.","As further evidence of our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and as a reflection of our confidence in the company's future, we announced today that we have raised our quarterly dividend payout 28% to $0.32 per share. For the fiscal year, Seagate generated over $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, of which we returned over 85% to shareholders through dividends and share redemptions. We ended the quarter and the fiscal year with approximately $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments.","We are on plan to reduce our share count to 350 million ordinary shares outstanding by calendar year-end 2012. Assuming market and macroeconomic conditions and the company's performance and valuation metrics are similar to what they are today, we plan to reduce our share count to 250 million ordinary shares by calendar year-end 2014. Given the assumptions stated above, we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend payments in a meaningful manner while continuing our redemption plan over the course of the next several years.","We achieved many of our goals in the June quarter and set records in revenue and unit shipments. There were, however, a few areas where we did not perform as expected, which we highlighted in our preliminary results announcement a few weeks ago. I'll discuss the dynamics of the quarter and our thoughts on the business outlook for the September quarter and fiscal year 2013.","Looking at our overall business activity in the quarter, we executed on our OEM agreements, and we resumed more typical volume shipments to the channel and retail markets. Overall unconstrained demand was lower than we expected going into the quarter. Against this demand profile, industry shipments have ramped to the point where supply and demand have come back into balance earlier than we had believed at the start of the quarter.","The company is encouraged by its performance in transitioning to the next-generation technology across its entire portfolio. We believe Seagate is leading in technology transitions in all product categories. As a result, our inventory is comprised primarily of the newest generation products.","In our enterprise business, we had a strong year-over-year growth, reflecting demand for cloud infrastructure build-outs and enterprise storage. Our shipments to cloud applications grew faster than the market, increasing 70% year-over-year.","Offsetting some of this strength in the quarter was an isolated supplier issue in one of our mission-critical products that impacted our enterprise business. From an operations standpoint, it was a unique problem that required a thorough and timely investigation in order to determine the root cause. Given the nature of the problem, which was a particle contaminant coming from a supplier 3 levels down in the supply chain, determining the root cause was a challenging endeavor. Once we identified the issue, we were able to switch to an alternate supplier, and we resumed shipping the product within the June quarter.","Despite our efforts to solve this issue quickly, the time we were out of the market impacted enterprise sales by approximately 1.5 million hard drives. As a result, our earnings were impacted by approximately $0.48 per share.","We recognize the fact that an issue like this requires additional engagement with our customers to regain their confidence. Given the overall strength of our [indiscernible], shipments were relatively flat sequentially, and our share decreased marginally to 56%. Our notebook drive sales were up 12%, resulting in nearly twice the sequential growth of the market due to the strength of the 7-millimeter product line and the successful ramp of the Samsung product line.","Our consumer electronics and retail businesses achieved sequential growth, and during the June quarter we made an important investment in our retail business with the proposed acquisition of LaCie, known for its premium external storage business.","The overall breadth and depth of our hard drive product portfolio leads the industry, and we are aligning our technology road map to broaden our ability to provide customers with hybrid and solid state products that leverage NAND flash technology. To facilitate this effort, we announced today that Gary Gentry will be rejoining Seagate as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our SSD business. Prior to rejoining Seagate, Gary was General Manager of Micron's Enterprise SSD business.","In the fall, we will be introducing our third-generation client hybrid drives, which will be in the 7-millimeter form factor. We will also be shipping demonstration units of our enterprise hybrid drives later this calendar year. We are encouraged by our engagements to date on this product, as several OEMs have requested exclusive access to this technology.","In addition to the enterprise SSD products we are shipping today, our technology partnership with Samsung has progressed on plan and has resulted in a highly competitive Tier 0 product. We expect to be shipping customer test units of this product at the end of this quarter.","To further deepen our SSD capabilities, we made a strategic investment in DensBits technology, and we are also jointly developing a next-generation solid state controller technology with DensBits that\u2019s focused on breaking through current cost, reliability and performance benchmarks in the client and enterprise markets.","We continue to believe that hybrid drives and SSDs are an important complementary technology to HDDs. We are confident in our approach to these markets, where we leverage our customer relationships and technical capabilities and focus on building core technology with strategic partners to produce best-in-class devices and solutions.","Turning to our September quarter outlook, we believe that the industry is operating with sufficient supply -- with supply sufficient to meet demand. We continue to monitor several key indicators in the market, including macroeconomic dynamics, overall PC demand, product mix, growth in tablets and smartphones, the upcoming release of Windows 8 and the numerous thin and light product initiatives.","Based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers, we are approaching the September quarter conservatively, focusing on supply-demand balance and are currently aligning our business for relatively flat demand sequentially and continued improvement in the average capacity per drive shipped.","For the September quarter, we expect to maintain market share, achieve revenue of approximately $4 billion, deliver gross margins exceeding 30% and have operating expenses that remain relatively flat. At this time, we believe the December quarter's addressable market will improve for the September quarter, and these conditions will put us on a path to revenues of at least $17 billion in calendar 2012 and exiting the year with margins above 30%. For fiscal 2013, assuming modest market growth, we are planning to maintain market share and deliver at least 25% annual growth in non-GAAP earnings.","With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, as previously discussed, we expect to continue to enhance shareholder value through dividends and share redemptions.","Seagate is well positioned in the current environment, and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our Investor Meeting on September 21. Melanie, we are now ready to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions from me. First of all, on the lost $0.48 during the quarter around the enterprise problem, can you just talk about more details in terms of how quickly you expect to recover that share and how it'd flow through the next couple of quarters? And then secondly, any details on capital spending for the full fiscal year? Not just the dollar amount, but what you're going to be spending at all will be helpful as well.","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, we'll give you what the dollar amount is. I don't think we plan to competitively tell people where we're deploying our capital. Dave, I'll let you handle that in a second. With respect to the $0.48, Steven, I think an issue like this, clearly we need to, like I said, rebuild confidence with our enterprise customers. I think some of the good things are we caught what was a very difficult problem in an extensive stress test, and we were able to really protect the vast majority of the field from the problem. That being said, I would expect that it's going to take us at least a couple or 3 quarters to regain the market share that we would typically see across our enterprise product line. And Dave, you want to talk about capital?","William David Mosley","Yes, I can. I think as a relative percentage of revenue, Steven, we\u2019d be about the same level that we were last year. I don't really see any reason in today's economy to be ticking it up if we -- we're through most of the product transitions. We've still got some technology transitions going on that force us to buy new capital, but we won't be adding significant capacity with the economy where it is right now. So that's the way I'd characterize it.","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Yes, and I -- and so Dave, if I could add to that. I mean actually, we looked at our historical model of 6% to 8% capital. We've talked about taking it below that, and we'd be below that range for next year with the outlook that Steve gave. So we're monitoring it very tightly. And as Dave said, he could position it if there's need for growth. But he's -- we're down much lower.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","And just a quick follow-up, Steve, just to make sure I'm clear on what you're saying about your outlook. It's all predicated on that you're comfortable with the current levels of market share you have now and going forward x the problem you had in the enterprise?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. I've always liked more market share. I'm not sure what you mean by comfortable. But we believe that the market shares that are in the industry today -- look, we've talked for a while about a 43-43-14 or 40-40 -- 42-42-16 kind of split between Seagate, Western Digital and Toshiba, with Hitachi and Samsung obviously still operating as either fully or semiautonomous units at Seagate and WD. So 45-42, could those shift by about a point or 2? Yes, but I mean, I still think that that's the general market share splits. And on the 66 million units, the 1 million units of lost enterprise isn't a huge market share issue. Obviously in terms of revenues and profits, it was very difficult. But yes I think overall, that's where the market will sell out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I can, as well. Steve, when we talk about the guidance and you say $4 billion roughly in revenue, looking at that on the basis of what you're telling us on the shares and the gross margin line, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is it seems like you're implying as much as a high single-digit sequential blended ASP decline to get close to that number if you keep your share trends on a flat TAM. So I'd just like -- I'd like to understand a little bit in the context of where you're seeing pricing going right now and how you're factoring that into your assumptions over the -- for calendar '12 but also looking out for fiscal '13. And then I do have a follow-up.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, pricing has remained relatively benign. I think the issues that you have to think about are mix more maybe than pricing and how mix relates to pricing and AUP. So with the pricing overall being relatively high compared to pre-flood, a lot of the OEMs have mixed down in order to preserve the budgets that they have going towards storage. So it's one of the factors that we're still learning a lot about in terms of what happens with different price moves at different capacity points and how does that result in volume changes and how does that result in AUP changes. So price erosion is one measure, but AUP is another. And so we try and think about AUPs that aren't hopefully falling at very high rates. And of course, one of the ways you can prevent AUPs from falling is by having mix up. So those are what we're continuing to model with our customers in order to kind of help them achieve what they're trying to achieve is also maintaining a -- the benign -- kind of the benign environment we have. I mean, it's fairly consistent with the outlook that was given by WD also in light of, I think, a September quarter that right now is a little bit vague from the OEM perspective. So we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of what the OEMs are seeing. And I guess we'll hear more about that in a month or so when 2 of the biggest OEMs report.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, Steve, clearly, you've made an appointment on the SSD side. You've invested in DensBits. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Do you think you have all the pieces of the puzzle as it relates to SSDs? And as it relates to DensBits, when do you expect products to hit the market from that investment that you've made?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, so the -- to answer the first part first, yes, we feel -- like I said in the script, I mean, we feel good about the approach we're taking for a market that today hasn't been terribly attractive from a profit perspective. And we've kind of consistently said that in the enterprise, we view this as a 2015 market where we want to be significantly engaged, and I feel like we're still on that path. Our work with Samsung has really progressed very, very well. We feel very good about the performance of the controller that we developed with them, and we're getting really quite good feedback from the test beds that we run, which we run at kind of enterprise HDD grade, which is quite a bit more stressful than what a lot of the SSD companies run. So I do feel good about the path that we're on. And our path, like I said, is really leveraging our customer relationships, leveraging a lot of what we know about enterprise-class storage and enterprise workloads and then complementing that with significant technology. So if there's technologies out there that we feel are going to be important going forward, then that's something we investigate typically in a partnership manner, as we've done so far. DensBits, I think, is a -- is really an indication of what I would say next, next generation. It's really about a controller technology that has the potential for significantly reducing the overall cost of the flash in both enterprise and client applications. And we're hard at work with them. We haven't disclosed yet when we expect to deliver a jointly developed technology, but we'd probably be talking to that more specifically in the September analyst meeting. But we feel very, very good about what we've been able to achieve, both with the investment and technically where we think we can go with DensBits.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Steve, 2, if I could, I guess, just real quickly on the September quarter guidance. What types of ASP declines do you have baked into the guidance right now?","Stephen J. Luczo","Pretty marginal, less than 5%.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. On a like-for-like basis?","Stephen J. Luczo","ASPs.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","ASPs, yes. Okay, great. And then the second one for me is to get to the share count, I guess, the 250 million exiting calendar year '13, I think you said -- I'm going to paraphrase -- something like a stable or normalized kind of environment. Can you give us -- I don't know, a little more sense of like what that might feel like? Or would something like this feel like that environment with a little slight growth in the TAM?","Stephen J. Luczo","End of year 2014, calendar year 2014, not 2013.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Sorry. Sorry about that. 2014, yes.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. Yes, I think what I said was assuming market conditions and company performance similar to what we're experiencing today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess I'm going to ask 2 questions, too. That\u2019s the norm. First, just on Samsung, if you can give us a view into -- I don't know where their contribution is in terms of percentage of units or just where that integration stands. And then secondly, just keeping with the flash discussion, you guys historically have obviously been the biggest proponents of hybrid drives. But if you look at the interest that's building in just using a flat small flash cache module plus a drive, where do you see that demand shaking out versus hybrid? I mean, do you think that's an interim step? Or do you think we literally end up with 3 setups: drive-only, full hybrid and then maybe in between using a flash cache plus a drive?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, thanks, Rob. One, Samsung, just quickly, operationally, we were integrated really at the end of December. So the March quarter, we were up. From an operations perspective, we were fully integrated. From a sales perspective, it's a separate entity. So everything that's revolved around the customer interaction, product planning, order, pricing, commitments, road maps, that's all a separate team. And that would continue to be in place under the requirements of ModCom [ph] through at least December this year, depending on whether or not the -- our agreement with ModCom [ph] terminates at that time or not. So it's integrated as much as we can, and it's operating well. And we don't break out separately the unit volumes of the Samsung product line. On your question on hybrid and flash cache modules, I mean, not to discredit any other great technology companies, we believe there are certain performance advantages to a real hybrid device. And we still believe that that's got some performance characteristics, both in terms of endurance and absolute performance that are better than other alternatives. But my guess is that yeah, it\u2019s a world where you'll see lots of different implementations of how flash presents itself in a system, even with people calling things hybrid drives that maybe we wouldn't call a hybrid drive, i.e., you could stick some flash in between the DRAM and a rotating disk and call it a hybrid, but if you don't have the algorithms that we've developed over those 3 or 4 years to optimize one in how you cache both on a rotating media as well as on the silicon and your error correction code n, n, n -- there is going to be a lot of different flavors out here. So again for us, I think the benchmark that we've tried to establish in our portfolio, whether or not it's on the client side or in the enterprise side is maintaining or bettering HDD performance, which is a technology that is robust and is step -- is standing the test of time on workloads. And I think it's one of the biggest challenges of flash, obviously, is write performance and write endurance, especially as you get to small and linear density or newer technologies that have to be compute grade. It's one thing to dump something down on a memory stick, and it's another to be really maintaining your corporate data in it. So that's where we think we bring a lot of value-add to the equation. So yes, so I think there will be all sorts of different versions, not just 3, but we're primarily focused on hybrid and full SSD along with HDD at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Steve, I'm wondering if you can take a crack at inventory for the industry, including your best guess at the OEM, and how that makes you think about the potential growth of the market in the December quarter. Any color there would be great.","Stephen J. Luczo","Okay, Keith. Well, let's just say -- I was just going to say no, but I'll -- but since you said in the December quarter -- look, I think it's -- you're on the point, which is that the industry, I think, has to be very cautious about maintaining supply-demand balance this quarter, particularly in light of the macroeconomic conditions, potential issues around our fiscal cliff and then weighing that against an opportunity in the December quarter that we're actually pretty bullish on, primarily driven by Windows 8. So it's just something that we're going to watch very closely and probably going into the quarter fairly conservatively in terms of build and inventory management. Again, I think it's important to recognize that in the case of Seagate, I'm not saying that it's not the case in WD, it's just not my position to talk to them, we're really running full on now with all of our new technology transitions, so -- across the portfolio, the products that we're building are products that we'll be building for a couple of years at least.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, right.","Stephen J. Luczo","And therefore, the management of the inventory is important, but we never kind of feel bad that we're stuck with some \"stale technology or stale products.\" So it's something we're watching closely. Where do I think people are? I think it's hard to say right now. It's -- the June quarter is always a tough quarter, and then you flow into July and August which are slow, and then September usually is very strong. So I think it's just something that we have to keep an active engagement with our customers on and make sure that neither us at the component level or they at the systems level get too out of balance. And obviously, we have our vested interests in doing that.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. let me -- just one clarification, if I will. Did you say mix would improve in the September quarter? I thought I heard that yet on Aaron's comment. It's just hard to reconcile ASPs going down as much as implicit within the guidance with mix improving, but perhaps I misheard it.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. I mean, again, I don't know if it\u2019s any different than what the other industry competitor has said. So -- but mix have -- I mean, average capacity per drive's flattened in the December quarter and the March quarter. They picked up in the June quarter. And so thus far this quarter, the average capacity per drive does seem to be improving. So I think it's really an issue of where does ASP end up. Where does TAM end up, to your point? How much inventory rebalancing is there? And again, we want to be conservative. If it turns out that the TAMs are bigger or the inventories are going to be replenished, then we can easily chase upside. That's not to say [indiscernible] chase upside than it is to reduce outflow once you build it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping to get your thoughts, Steve, on inventory growth going forward. I think you commented that you expect -- for your calendar '14 guidance or fiscal '13 guidance that you expect modest unit growth. If we look at the flat TAM guidance for 3Q, it looks like units declined 10% year-over-year. So I'm just curious what type of modest growth do you think there is going forward? And does it worry you at all that 3Q is down that much?","Stephen J. Luczo","No, it doesn't worry me in light of the macro conditions that we're in and in light of maybe what some delayed purchases around Windows. I think that the kind of 5% to 7% unit growth number that industry analysts are putting out there seems to be the right number for how the world feels right now. You could be here the third week of September and things could be a lot better or a lot worse depending on what's going on with the macro conditions. But I'd say right now, growth is probably a good thing and period [ph] relative to what a lot of other companies and industries are facing. So -- and the fact that September is down seems pretty -- flat seems pretty consistent with what most technology companies are saying, which is they feel like it's a bit of a roll, but they're still fairly confident about December and the first half of 2013. So now, obviously flat relative to what a normal September would be, you could argue is down 5% or 7%, right? I think that's a reflection of what we're reading in the newspaper every day. It's not like there's a lot of great structural decisions being made by the leaders of the world. So maybe when those people start getting their act together, then we can get some better growth.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Well hopefully, that will happen soon. And then I just want a clarification on fiscal '13. I wasn't sure if that was EPS growth of at least 25%. Does that also include buybacks in that assumption?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, it's EPS growth.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And that includes your buyback plans?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones, one on technology. In terms of the enterprise hybrid hard drives, do you see others in the industry supplying that as well? Or looking at it another way, do you think the OEMs will acquire multiple sources for that? Or do you think you can go for a while as a single vendor?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I don't think -- again, Rich, if -- the type of hybrid drive we're talking about no, we don't think that there's anything competitively in the marketplace just because of the amount of time that we've spent developing the technology around our hybrid drives. It's been going on for 4 or 5 years really. And in terms of the OEMs, since we've had OEMs that have asked us for exclusivity, I would say that it would be really obnoxious for them to ask for exclusivity but require redundancy. So I think we'll probably get over that heartache. The performance on these drives and certain attributes that certain segments require is pretty impressive given the dollar investment relative to pure SSD. So it's a pretty exciting opportunity, and I think people will feel quite comfortable. Probably half of our portfolio, we're the only company that provides right now. So it's not like we're not sole sourced through a lot of our customers in the enterprise. Most of the small form factor SAS products we're really the only supplier of right now. So that's something that they're pretty comfortable with.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of inventory, since the flood, the industry has had some pretty good visibility by directly shipping to the OEMs or their manufacturers and moving away from hubs. Is that still the case today? Are the hubs being used?","Stephen J. Luczo","It's kind of getting modified, I'd say. So Dave, you can answer the question about what our direct shipments were over the course of the quarter. But Rich, overall, I think again, most of our customers certainly the biggest and most sophisticated ones, are focused on velocity of inventory as opposed to kind of, if you will, cost of product. I think a lot of them were less than a -- saving $0.50 on a drive is not nearly as impactful as the velocity of getting a product through that generates $500 to $2,500 of revenue. So if there's any issues around reestablishment of inventory, if you will, regardless of who owns it in the hub, right, I think that there\u2019s been a lot more focus on doing that in a way that increases velocity. So it's not concerning to me. Dave, you want to answer the first part of that question?","William David Mosley","Well, I think you said it, Steve. The only thing I'd add, Rich, is that it's not just about the velocity, but it's also about foreseeing the demand and making it as predictable as possible just so we make sure we have the right product [ph] in the right place versus flowing out to hubs and having too much there. So from a quantifications [ph] perspective, we're not nearly for the models, the various models that we had before. There are some hubs that are open but specifically for some customers, there's reasons why we haven't opened the hubs and we're still having a really successful model develop after the flood: velocity and this demand predictability and fulfillment predictability.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So the inventory that's on your balance sheet in terms of finished goods is more a reflection of the new normal as opposed to stopping production for the past -- the last 2 weeks or something like that?","William David Mosley","Kind of a good way to think about it is that maybe in the past it would have been largely in hubs, and now it's largely close to the backdoors of our factory.","Stephen J. Luczo","And Dave, percentage direct ships, June quarter?","William David Mosley","Yes, still over 80%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping I could get a little bit of context around gross margin for the September quarter and maybe what some of the positives and negatives are there, and how close to that 30% level you kind of expect to be, because I know you said greater than 30%. And then just secondly, Steve, with -- around the December number, it seems like it was back out at $17 billion. You're looking at $4 billion -- just over $4 billion worth of revenues. And so I guess I'm trying to triangulate. You said you feel bullish on the fourth quarter prospects with a number of things going on. Obviously, you probably have some ASP reductions and maybe they'll be benign again. But just trying to triangulate sort of a flat or -- revenue number and the sort of bullish commentary around the fourth quarter.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, I'll let Pat answer the gross margin question. I think what we said was revenues of at least $17 billion, not $17 billion. So if I stumbled over those words sometimes, since I seem to stumble over a few in the script, I apologize. So it's revenues of at least $17 billion if December plays out the way we think. Do you want...","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Yes. And then the gross margin, obviously, as Steve talked, there is pricing, and we view it as relatively benign. But there is pricing. But the upside, as Steve said, using the pricing that we are to mix up in all product categories, whether it's enterprise, mixing up the capacity, clients, et cetera. But the other piece is that with the enterprise share loss last quarter because of the issue, we're regaining it. And I -- it's not that we're not we're regaining it, it's just not at our historical levels. So that certainly gives us opportunity for the next quarter. And the last piece would be now that these products are ramping pretty significantly, we're getting the cost efficiencies that will probably continue for a couple more quarters through the factories. So we got those tailwinds behind us. And of course, the one that -- why we put it near to the 30% and we're not talking how close is that there are macro concerns that we're just going to be very partial about. But our goal is to exceed what we're putting out there, but we're also being very cautious. So I think we have some good tailwinds behind us that we're looking forward to harvest.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A question on distributor revenue first, up 37% sequentially by our math. Is that just rebalancing, or is there something more going on there?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, no, it's just as we finally had product to address the channel away from the OEMs to bring it [indiscernible], it's just giving us, like I said, the ability to kind of start shipping more typically there. So they were pretty constrained, obviously, in the 2 prior quarters to that.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. And then with LTAs, would those still comprise 60% of calendar '12 production? And should we expect to see LTAs carry into calendar '13?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. I mean I think 60%, I think that number is still the right number it is. And we do have LTAs that extend into calendar year 2013. There may be even some that go beyond that. So yes, you should expect that that\u2019d be due.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citigroup.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question is regarding the new products. Steve, you mentioned that you're leading the industry in the new product transitions in every form factor. Can you help us understand how this advantage is translated in either volume or profitability for the company?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, as you ramp the technology, typically your newer technologies have lower cost at yield. So the further down or the further up the volume curve you are, then the further ahead in the race you are on getting to the lower cost. And so we feel that whether or not it's the 1 terabyte per disk on the 3.5 or the 500-gigabyte on the 2.5 or the host of products on the enterprise, those are just good technology points to be on in order -- as Pat said, as we ramp those and we pick up yield, which means we lower cost.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So is it fair to assume that just based on similar mix, your margins should be better than the competitor's?","Stephen J. Luczo","No, I don't know about that because I don't run my competitor's business, but it should say that as we continue to ramp our volumes, we get a positive gross margin impact from the increased volume that we get from the new products. And so we're on the front end of that ramp. And usually, once you get on to that ramp, you get some nice gross margin accretion for a couple or 3 quarters.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And for Pat, you've obviously increased your dividend in a fairly short amount of time. Can you talk about your thinking behind the recent increase and maybe just how we should be thinking about future dividend increases?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Well, I mean the way we look at this first step function, Joe, is we -- I think we've effectively executed what the board authorized us to redeem the ordinary shares out there. And we did that in a fairly effective manner with the tools given to us. And so we take a look at -- just from a year-over-year with 100 million shares out, clearly the step-up is not a -- more of a significant cash outflow, just representing the existing cash flow we would have given and a commitment to where we believe the valuation could be underpinned with the ongoing cash flow. So that's step 1. And step 2, we'll continue to monitor -- as Steve said in the script, we'll continue to look at enhancing shareholder value through redemptions and dividends. And so this one was more of a step function because of what we've executed in the last year and our conviction going forward.","Stephen J. Luczo","But I think I was pretty clear that the intent of the board is to continue to increase the dividend in a meaningful manner, prudently assuming that business conditions and operating performance are as strong as they are right now and that there's a balance between how we handle that between buyback and dividends. And we're well aware of all the various constituencies and lobbying about which one of those deserve priority. But at 3x cash flow, I think everyone's -- or 4x cash flow or wherever the company's trading right now, it makes sense, obviously, to reduce the equity base and then continue to increase dividends in, as I said, in a meaningful way. So that's the plan. And I think in September, we'll probably be a little more descriptive in terms of how we view our payout ratio, if you will, and how we split that between dividends and buyback. But again, it's a dynamic situation that's driven primarily as a function of company performance and valuation metrics. We're not ignoring either one of them. We think that they're both important to enhance the value of shareholders. That's primarily driven, obviously, by our operating performance. And we're going to continue to have an active dialogue and hopefully strike a balance that satisfies both classes of investors that like to see a smaller share base and those that like to see a bigger dividend. And we honestly think we can do both, and I think we've shown that we can do both. So we'll stay on the path as long as the operating performance is there.","Okay, great. So with that, I think again, on behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees, our customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders for your support and your commitment, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. That does conclude the presentation. You may disconnect.

Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Mosley, President and Chief Operating Officer.","We've posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our June quarter and year-end fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com.","During today's call, we will review the highlights for the June quarter and fiscal year 2017 and provide the company's outlook for the September quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour. And we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.","We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's earnings call I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. And Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights. And I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.","Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan. Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer. Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company. Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately.","Over the last two years the board and I have been focused on executive management succession. In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago. And recently we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate Schuelke as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary; and Ravi Naik as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer.","In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygaard. And we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements.","The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace, and continue to create long term shareholder value.","It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years. I'm grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders. And I look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate.","Turning to our operational results. The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability. And we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth.","In the context of the storage marketplace the major transformative shifts from a client server to mobile cloud high capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. The long term trajectory of growth in infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact, as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum.","At the same time, the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates.","In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2 times to 3 times in the memory markets. The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters.","For the June quarter Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year over year, net income of $192 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.65.","HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive. And ASPs per unit were $64.","We saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S. based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets. Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China CSP nearline demand, and our own Cloud Storage Systems business. In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and NAS markets due to some intraquarter channel inventory management.","As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan, with approximately half of that shortfall from our Cloud Storage Systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management. We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and NAS and surveillance market demand, are temporal and supply chain related, while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural.","Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance. Within this, approximately two-thirds of the impact was due to operational trends issues in our CSSG business and approximately one-third was due to lower than expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix.","GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year over year. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year over year.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million. And free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year over year.","While we were disappointed to not meet our top-line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year 2017. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, for fiscal year 2017 we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.","In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year 2017. And we are well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities.","David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Steve. For the June quarter we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage, with an average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market we shipped 23.5 exabytes, with an average capacity per drive of 3.4 terabytes. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over 4.8 terabytes per drive, up 8% over last year's strong 8-terabyte sales quarter and up 60% from the June quarter two years ago.","We continue to ramp our 10TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter. Our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last two quarters. And we expect to ship approximately 1 million 10TB units in the September quarter. In addition, our 12TB product shipped for revenue in the June quarter with excellent customer feedback. And we are confident our qualification process is competitive. We expect to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB market by the end of the calendar year.","The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployment continue to represent a significant opportunity for Seagate. And we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these storage environments. Over the next 12 months to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from 2TB to 4TB products for certain applications and up to 16 terabyte for other use cases.","In the client and retail markets our 1TB per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. And to date, we have shipped over 45 million drives, substantially ahead of the competition. Using similar technology, our 2TB per platter, 3.5-inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB client capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition.","Operating expenses for the June quarter were $470 million on a GAAP basis and $422 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 5% year over year. Total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to lower variable compensation.","We continued to identify areas for cost improvements. And this morning we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately $90 million annually. These cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter. In addition to these actions, we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of FY 2018.","Capital expenditures were $104 million for the June quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment.","Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $243 million. And free cash flow was $139 million. These results include approximately $50 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges.","Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the June quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 292 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 4.","Interest expense for the June quarter was $62 million and will be lower in the September quarter due to the lower debt balance. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.","In FY 2017 we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5% and paid $316 million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt, including our 2021's 7% senior notes.","Overall, our operational and financial performance in FY 2017 reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our Storage portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go to market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.","I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Dave. Turning to the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends. We believe the end to end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year. And therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher than normal supply chain pricing.","At the same time we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market.","For the September quarter we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range. Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially.","As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter. And we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year 2017, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter.","Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we'll now open the call up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from me. First of all, on the Nearline Enterprise business, have you identified any market share shifts that might have hurt either the quarter or your outlook?","And then secondly, in terms of the non-HDD business, the Enterprise Systems and Flash business, you've done a bunch of acquisitions in there over the last few years. It's had sort of fits and starts. And this quarter is somewhat disappointing. I guess I'm wondering if you could just sort of step back and give us your big picture take on those acquisitions and the progress you expect to make in the coming quarters? Thanks.","William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah, Steve. This is Dave Mosley. Let me try the first one. They're somewhat interrelated, I think, your two questions. So on the nearline side, some customers you're heavy with and other customers you're not as heavy with. So there are some fundamental shifts going on, depending on capacity points. I think at the highest capacity points there are some things about our ramp that we're not happy with. The product is really good. And we're ramping it hard right now.","At the lower capacity points, the 4 terabytes and 8 terabytes and things like that, quite happy with our products. That's where some of the China CSP behavior and the smaller customers and their issues that they had across their supply chain were affected. So there's slight share shifts going on. But really only the highest capacity point is super relevant, and we think that's temporal.","Like I said, the two questions that you asked are interrelated somewhat. The systems business that we have is \u2013 there's a few different kinds of business in there. There's some specialty products buildout that we do. And then there's some things where we're really acting more like an ODM, I'll say. And that stuff is not very good business.","And obviously a lot of ODMs got themselves into situations with the supply chain issues where either they were underwater or they couldn't procure parts at the right point. They had supply that was older supply, so to speak. So it was a really tough road for the last two quarters in that. And we're going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Steve, congrats on retirement. Dave, congrats on the new role. Just a question on gross margins. Appreciate that you've guided flat for September. But when you take a more medium term look out a couple of quarters, is 29% the right normalized gross margin to think about? Or are there costs in the September quarter around the 10- and 12-terabyte ramp around enterprise mix that you think is depressing the gross margin in September? And you would expect a rebound from that level? Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","So, Katy, let me first say, while I appreciate your congratulations on the retirement, much to my children's chagrin, I have not retired. In fact, this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years. But I did I suppose retire from the CEO job. But so I'm super happy about where I'm headed and what my engagement will be with the company. Also super happy that Mosley is CEO.","As I said to someone the other day, that running a disc drive company is a little bit like driving in stop-and-go traffic. Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour. But you usually get to your destination on time and no one's hurt. But it's stressful as shit for the driver and oftentimes for the passengers too. So I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now.","The \u2013 I think your point is right on where we're headed on margins. The way we see the math, to your point, clearly ramps are always challenging, whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or a 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product. And whenever you're ramping the products, the yields come up the ramp. And you get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down. And you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera. So we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mix-up that occurs as customers move from 10s [terabytes] to 12s [terabytes] to 14s [terabytes] to 16s [terabytes] that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range.","I think the good news on the quarter frankly is even with the weakness that we had in nearline and mission critical in certain customer bases and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should have been. Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD business is operating pretty nicely right now. And yes, it should improve as we execute here in the second half of the year.","William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from C. J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess two questions. First part, in terms of your commentary on enterprise, can you walk through in a little more detail what you're seeing as temporary versus structural? And then I guess as a follow-up question on the gross margins side, is Enterprise still above 40%? Or do we see it dip below there? And how should we think about I guess that part of your business going forward? Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah. Let me answer that. And then I'll turn the other thing back to Mosley. Like, we've never talked about where our gross margins are by products. And it's a really dangerous game to get in, because we're so leveraged in our manufacturing and our R&D systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments, while it may be a fun accounting practice, it's really deceiving from an overall business practice.","I will tell you though that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies we're deploying. And again we have an areal density lead there that's now going on almost two years. So that means fewer heads and discs. So to reach the same capacity points those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively.","So but I think the real message here is that it's you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole. And we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible.","William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc","And then on the enterprise commentary, there's a structural piece in the sense that our mission critical lines are continuing to decrease somewhat. Some of that is penetration from flash. Some of that's architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise. And we may see some rebound of that with new chipsets that are coming out from Intel, for example.","But it's kind of interesting, because the last few quarters \u2013 we saw a strong back half to the last calendar year. But the last few quarters have been weaker. And that's counter intuitive with flash prices going up the way they did. So that's the stuff that we're referring to as structural though.","The temporal stuff, it's very different. If you look at the bill of materials, whether you're a cloud service provider, you're world \u2013 around the world or whether you're an enterprise builder, the bill of materials was dramatically upset because of some component price increases. And tradeoffs had to be made inside of that. In some cases the tradeoffs can't be made, because your supply chain can't do the build with the right economics. In some cases you'll make the tradeoff by saying, I'll prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of DRAM for example right now. And then I'll hold.","The good news on that front for us is \u2013 well, first the bad news. The bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year. And that doesn't make sense for where the cloud is going. The good news is from the discussions that we have with our customers worldwide, growth of bits inside of data centers is still on a pretty healthy pace. And so this will come back. We've seen this a number of different times in our industry. And that's why we'll call it temporal.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I guess I wanted to ask about the restructuring. Was this something that you already had planned in prior quarters? Or was the restructuring a result of something that happened during this quarter that made you feel like you needed to take some additional cost actions?","David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc","Hi, Sherry. This is Dave. No. This has been in constant dialogue and under plan, as we continued to drive to a glide path of exiting calendar year \u2013 this calendar year under $400 million. And so this has long been in process as we go out and continue to drive further synergies amongst the organizations. And how we continue to repivot to higher yielding, higher portfolioed product sets that we bring to market.","So to your point, this is something that we've definitely had under long consideration and have taken the necessary actions.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah. If you go back a year ago, we kind of \u2013 I think we did at the June call of last year indicate that we were going to take a variety of actions on the manufacturing side to address the capacity issues and where that would have a significant COGS impact, which is obviously reflected.","And secondly, that we were going to work OpEx on two different vectors. One was absolute OpEx dollars, and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to. That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down, because the last six months of last year were quite strong. And we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand. And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well. And that benefited us extremely through fiscal year 2017, where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago.","So I think we're back on how do we get to $400 million? I would probably say though, as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million, that that is not a reflection so much of something going on in the market as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your OpEx. You obviously then see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions. And some of it is also related to things that Dave Mosley mentioned about what's the quality of business that we're doing in the systems side? And what's the underlying OpEx support for that? And does that math really make sense?","So a little bit of that, I'd say in terms of how we're going to get from $400 million to $375 million. But not like market-related to the sale of disk drives. It's more I think related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as one that's positive.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on the nearline, just quickly. That piece, I think you did a good job of describing where the weakness was. And it sounds like the cloud is still healthy. But can you give us some sense of the mix in nearline in terms of the exabyte shipments? I think I've heard generally 50% goes to cloud and 50% goes to traditional businesses. But it'd be helpful to have some perspective on that. Thanks.","William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc","I think it's probably a little lower going to the cloud service providers. If by the cloud service providers, you mean the top \u2013 the biggest ones of them, right? It's probably a little bit lower than that historically.","We did get into this discussion about structural versus temporal and noted some of the weakness among OEM nearline worldwide. And some of that may be structural as well, Sherri. I'd say as people are looking to buy, they may be buying from ODMs or other third parties, their non-traditional customers. And that model is accelerating. It's not going back to the old way. So some of that \u2013 that's been soft. But some of it may be structural as well.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Okay. I think we have time for one more question, because I know we're running into the open here. And we want to be respectful of that.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next question is from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question here. I just wanted to better understand where we are from a technical perspective. You'd talked about some changes in R&D in terms of getting to the next node and HAMR type of technology.","And then also if we could just review what you think about in terms of your policy around keeping folks updated around quarters with respect to mid-quarter updates, pre-announcements, and those types of activities, that would be great. Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","I'll do the HAMR first. So this is a technology, for everyone's benefit, that we've been working on for quite some time in the hard drive industry. It's the next S-curve. The top of the areal density curve that we're on right now, it's getting harder and harder to squeeze that much more out of.","The progress \u2013 and we haven't talked about HAMR very much in the last two years. But the progress has actually been pretty substantial in the labs both on the reliability front, which was really the issue, and then on the demonstration of areal density front as well. So historically we had talked about 20-terabyte drives in 2020. And we still are on path for those kind of demonstrations. We're going to shoot as high as we can. And we may even get above that based on what we're seeing in the labs right now. But productization is looking more and more favorable all the time. And we're going to be driving hard from it from inside of Seagate.","So what that means is there's been a lot of discussions about 12 [terabytes] and 14 [terabytes] and then ultimately we'll get to 16 terabytes. But we will get to 20 [terabytes] and 24 terabytes some day. And we're seeing that \u2013 those kind of components in the labs right now that with the right amount of coaxing, we'll get them into products and get them out to the markets.","And then on...","David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah, Stanley, this is Dave Morton. In regards to a definitive process per se on a pre or not a pre, I think the approach that the management team took this go-round was, given the fact that there was so much information coming together and lack of visibility of what was really extending out, not only between this quarter but to the back half of the year's results, we opted to have a further context and full disclosure and earnings call set around the full year, versus just the current situation at hand to be able to provide a full context to our investors and shareholders. So that was our thought process that went into it.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Very helpful.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Okay. I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to be on the call today and thanks to our employees and our customers and suppliers and investors. Look forward to talking to you next call.

Seagate demonstrated solid execution this quarter achieving revenues of $3.5 billion, net income of $428 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.24.","On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $455 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We had a very strong cash flow quarter generating operating cash flow of $856 million and free cash flow of $713 million. During the December quarter, we shipped a record 52.2 exabytes of storage and averaged a record 922 gigabytes per drive across our portfolio.","Our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.4% and operating expenses, inventory turns, and day sales outstanding were within our targeted ranges. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments.","As part of our capital allocation strategy, returning value to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends remains a top priority for Seagate. During the December quarter, we redeemed 33 million shares which put us a few quarters ahead of our fiscal \u201914 plan and raised our quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.43 per share.","Through these activities, we expect to meet our goal of returning approximately 70% of operating cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year.","We have talked about strategic acquisitions as a potential area of capital deployment and at the end of December we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Xyratex for $374 million. Xyratex is a leading provider of data storage technology including hard disk drive test equipment in modular solutions for the enterprise data storage industry. The addition of Xyratex will further enhance Seagate\u2019s vertically integrated supply and manufacturing chain for disk drives and ensure uninterrupted access to important capital equipment. The acquisition also expands Seagate\u2019s storage solutions portfolio by adding Xyratex\u2019s industry leading enterprise data storage systems and high performance computing business.","We expect to close this transaction sometime in the June quarter and for the acquisition to be slightly accretive in its first full fiscal year of operation or sooner.","As the trends in Exabyte growth and technology shifts continue to develop over time, we focus on a few main areas that we believe will allow us to continue to deliver solid results in the near term and position us well for long term success. These areas include expanding and innovating our storage product portfolio to align with emerging trends in mobility, cloud, and open source computing.","In the mobile space, we\u2019re leading the industry in hybrid technology and our 5-millimeter drives are now being sold by multiple-OEM manufacturers in tablets. For cloud-based applications, we have launched our Kinetic platform for object based storage with strong interest from developers, customers, and then users, and we are continuing to expand our offering of high capacity drives with our 6-disk, 6-terabyte drive shipping early next quarter. Investing and improving areal density and advanced storage technologies, we are shipping in-volume drives that utilize single magnetic recording or SMR and we will continue to deploy this technology advancement across our portfolio in the coming months. We also continue to invest in advancing our HAMR technology development and our hybrid and flash technology initiatives.","We are deepening our customer engagements. One of the most positive emerging trends we are seeing is the interest from customers in requesting a deeper strategic engagement. Our opportunity to add more value for our customers and help them advance in areas such as big data analytics, hyperscale data management, and high-density content management are new opportunities for the disk drive industry. We are making investments in our go-to-market capabilities and product development and technology to engage more strategically with an expanding customer landscape, including OEMs, service providers, enterprise information technology functions, and consumers, and we are managing our capital investments. We are currently running our capital investments at the lower end of our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, and it will be most likely -- and it will most likely be below the range for the full fiscal year. We are managing our production cautiously, and we are pleased with our performance against our metrics for manufacturing efficiency and operational excellence.","Turning to our March quarter outlook, we expect to achieve at least $3.4 billion in revenues and to maintain non-GAAP margins approximately flat sequentially. Demand so far has been at a solid pace this quarter and industry inventory remains low. We are planning for operating expenses to be relatively flat sequentially, which would result in OpEx that is slightly higher than our targeted range of 12% to 14% of revenue for the third quarter, but it\u2019s still within the targeted range for the fiscal year. Over the last year and a half, industry Exabyte shipments have grown approximately 30%, while units have remained in a manageable range of between 130 million and 145 million units per quarter. Based on macroeconomic conditions, we expect these market dynamic characteristics to continue as customers remain cautious with their forecast and the project-based nature of cloud build-out represents challenges for them in terms of purchasing, timing \u2013 of purchase timing. Given these dynamics, we are running our business consistent with what we have done in the last several quarters by managing production slightly lower than forecast with the ability to flex up if additional demand warrants.","On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank our employees for the performance this quarter and thank our customers, partners and suppliers for their support and commitment. Seagate is well-positioned in the storage technology markets we serve and we will continue to focus on executing to our financial model and delivering strong operating results for Seagate shareholders. We are now ready to take questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please proceed.","","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Yes, thanks for taking the question. So I guess I want to go back to two things really, the comment on the capacity shift, if I look at your capacity shift and also what Western Digital had reported, it looks like we saw about 12% year-over-year growth. So I am kind of curious of what underneath of that you are seeing be it on the enterprise side, I guess in the context of that given the decline sequentially that we saw in this last quarter?","","Steve Luczo","Decline, I am not sure you are referencing any decline?","","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","The enterprise shipments sequentially declined in the December quarter?","","Steve Luczo","Okay.","","Rocky Pimentel","This is Rocky Pimentel. I think it addresses actually which I think our competitor referred to, in the fourth quarter, I think the industry saw a bit of a softness in the cloud side of the enterprise drives, the capacity-centric enterprise drives, and that was really just due to the timing of the build-outs and planning of CapEx. It has continued to be a category that offers substantial long-term growth, but I think as others have pointed out, it will be a situation where it will be lumpy until processes improve at the cloud service providers to create a more smooth and linear approach to how they deploy their resources in the data center but I think that was just what you saw in the December quarter, but fundamentally the category is very strong and represents a tremendous growth opportunity as we go forward.","","Steve Luczo","One of the things that we have noticed in terms of conversations with some of the customers, in case, sometimes it's through the OEMs and sometimes it's directly with the customers that are deploying. There has been a lot of effort to reduce the time between purchase and deployment of these assets that are going into the cloud infrastructure, and especially you know the folks that are in the multi-billion dollar range per year, so deployment being reduced from in excess of nine months to more best-in-class deployment rates that are probably in the 3- to 4-month range now are still working their way through the industry, and so I think that does create a situation where there is inventory that\u2019s basically being absorbed as people reduce that deployment time.","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Couple of questions, one I guess just for the March quarter, it sounds like you are expecting sales to be down about at least 3.5% - 4% or so. What are you expecting from a TAM basis, and then on the pricing as well because it sounds like enterprising can actually pick up for you guys a bit in the March quarter?","","Steve Luczo","Again I think what we -- right now the outlook is for revenues to be at least $3.4 billion so it's in the least. So, I mean I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the percentage you want to apply to that and it kind of depends how good the quarter fills out, but it's off to a good start. In terms of TAM, that\u2019s why we try to make the comments that we did that the industry seems to have been operating in the 130 to 145 range, and we expect it will continue to operate in that range, and then I guess we said in the last few calls within that range, you know, arguing about whether or not it's an extra 1 million or 2 million units is not what drives the business models of the companies.","","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","And inventory, let\u2019s say was up about 9% sequentially for you guys. Can you talk about what drove that in the quarter and how do you expect inventory to track in the March quarter going forward?","","Dave Mosley","Yeah, a couple of things on inventory, so finished goods was relatively flat, although there is some of the \u2013 I\u2019m going to call it and hold it across the finish line especially in the cloud space, because their lead times are very long for those product lines. I think as people know, but finished goods was relatively flat. It was within raw materials and some of that was just staging for this early linearity that we have seen pretty healthy up against Chinese New Year, I think so, but that\u2019s the general trend there. I think we can get it back right down and check to where we have been running them the last four quarters, so I\u2019m not too worried about inventory.","","Steve Luczo","Inventory in the system at the customers is very lean.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Just following up again on those enterprise comments I guess your overall enterprise unit growth lagged to Western Digital this quarter, but your capacity [centered] (ph) drives certainly performed nicely despite not having a 6 terabyte drive in the market. So I guess were you surprised by that growth and do you think that will accelerate when you have a more competitive product in the market next quarter?","","Rocky Pimentel","I think we definitely think there is lots of opportunities, still you know some throwing out in some of the cloud service providers demand, but certainly as we go out over the year strong growth and in terms of next generation capacity-centric drives, you know we\u2019re very positive because we will be, we\u2019re releasing a 6-disk, 6 terabyte drive early in the June quarter which we think will be very interesting to the customer demand.","","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Okay well maybe then on the performance-optimized side, I guess what\u2019s going on there? Is there any sort of competitive dynamics impacting your growth there?","","Rocky Pimentel","No I think it's pretty much as it's been in the last number of quarters. Nothing unusual there.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Steve, I hope you could talk about within the PC category, the mix of hard disk drives within PCs, and really just kind of where they are trending, is the rate of share loss let\u2019s say easing? From my \u2013 from where I sit, I guess in the low end, we are starting to see some $300 type PCs with traditional HDDs and Windows, etcetera that seemingly makes sense for the category that has faced some headwinds from Chromebooks. And then in the high end, you guys have put out the press releases on the 5 millimeter getting into 2-in-1s in some tablets, so really just kind of curious on your commentary of the rates of share movement of HDDs within the PC category?","","Steve Luczo","Yes, I mean, I think the client business was stronger than we would have expected in the December quarter and it was stronger throughout the quarter, and client can be desktop and\/or notebook and it seems to be continuing into this quarter. So in that sense, I think there is a stabilization and I am glad you pointed out, most of the world is not at $1,000 price point, but I think that the one thing in your comment, to just point out too in terms of even the high end, about 6 million notebook units a year -- a quarter going out with SSDs, but the hybrid penetration on that has been actually growing as well. I think last quarter we did something like 1.7 or 1.5 million hybrid drives, so almost 20% of that market that was part of that time, SSD-only has already been penetrated by HDD, which I think not a lot of people aren\u2019t really focused on.","And then as you pointed out, the traction of the 5-millimeter drives in no thinner, wider either direct tablets or even convertibles, we do think it\u2019s going to be a decent product category, especially for people that have high-density content that they want to have on those devices. So I do think that there is plenty of role for disk drives to play in this ecosystem. But again as you heard me say many times, whether or not it\u2019s about mobility or whether or not it\u2019s about SSDs, these are all complementary technologies that are just expanding the product portfolio of technology that people use, and it grows the overall need for storage across the ecosystem whether or not there is lighter devices that are helping it make people capture things in 4K like the Samsung Note 3 has 4K capture capability, and that eats up a lot of video in an hour or the network effect of being able to share that stuff. At the end of the day, it all ends up on a disk drive or usually three to four of them. So I don\u2019t want to make it seem like it is this net zero sum game, because I don\u2019t think it is at all, I think these are just technologies that are growing the ecosystem, but we do believe there is a role for high-density caching g, which is really what we do with the 5 millimeter drives, and we believe those opportunities are expanding, not decreasing.","","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I am glad you brought up hybrids , that was my follow-up, just kind of curious where are we innings or however you want to talk about it on the high-end client environment taking a look at hybrid again adopting them, I would assume we are still in the early innings, kind of curious if you can talk through it?","","Steve Luczo","Yes, early innings and actually we have often been surprised a few times over the last five or six quarters in terms of some of the traction that we see with hybrid on desktop and it\u2019s not just gamers. So no, I think the hybrid drive, it\u2019s probably not a great name for \u2013 probably some of the different names of hybrid, but I think high performance drives have their role and I think we are still in the mode of thinking the majority of our portfolio is going to be hybrid drives whether or not it\u2019s for aerial density or performance as we look out over the next three or four years.","","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Thank you.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jay Noland with Robert Baird. Please proceed.","","Jay Noland - Robert Baird","Okay, great. I wanted to follow-up on the hyperscale drive opportunity, Steve, it sounds like it\u2019s in lumpy and a certain degree of limited visibility right now, I wonder if that\u2019s a function of just the product cycle at this point or maybe R&D that\u2019s involved, but your outlook, your thoughts on the full year calendar \u201814 as it relates to this part of the market?","","Steve Luczo","Well, I mean, we are still encouraged by the outlook for the full year. And I think that this is a market, where small unit TAM variances can have big implications. I mean, the community, the investor community sometimes moves the driver to driver to drive, a million notebooks drives is just like a million nearline drives and that\u2019s not in lot of case in terms of lead time, ability to respond revenue or profits associated with and some of that is related to the technology and some of it's related to the test.","We\u2019re still confident that 2014 is going to be a positive year in terms of deployment and cloud infrastructure what it means for the growth related to nearline drives. I do think that there is this added variable that the big users of this technology realize that they can\u2019t take nine or more months to deploy the assets because they get into this very difficult situation where they are making estimates about cloud infrastructure and not just storage, right, but everything that goes into the infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure is nine months out to satisfy a quality of service for users and that\u2019s just too long of a lag and so you get this thing of it's not really about in quarter demand it's about how well did you predict demand was going to be three quarters ago and it's costly. I mean that\u2019s all inventory that basically they laid out capital for, they haven't started generating revenue. So it's an intense focus clearly at the big buyers of this capital especially if you\u2019re spending 1, 2, 3, 5, $7 billion a year on it to get that stuff in the production much quicker and I think there has been success. As we look at our customer base and the big purchasers of those systems, again whether or not it's through OEM or direct I think that time of deployment is actually compressing which is allowing them I think to use some of that inventory that they bought a couple of quarters ago to bring it online quicker and we will see if that features holds out but we\u2019re still bullish about the Russell calendar year especially actually when you think about the 4K deployment and a lot of the technologies that were shown down at CES whether or not it was actual high density captured equipment or high density viewing [ph] equipment or some of the technologies being shown to assist big data analytics, biometrics and various other technologies.","It all talks to an increasing need for people to keep the data. We\u2019re still bullish about it and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not pulling back on how we invest in that infrastructure because I think it's going to be the situation where again if the industry is faced with a 1 million or 2 million unit upside on nearline in the quarter the industry can\u2019t respond to that. If it's faced with a 1 million or 2 million unit upside on notebook we can probably respond to that in two weeks, that\u2019s how different those two markets are.","So we\u2019re going to stay focused on making sure that we can deliver till it's upsides as they come.","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please proceed.","","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Just a couple of questions from me, first of all, looking at this current calendar year in terms of Exabyte growth, how confident are you in achieving 30% type of growth rate for those shipments and any color on how the mix might be changing between on an average capacity and then secondly I know you\u2019re not talking about Xyratex specifically but can you just sort of outline your plans for say moving upscale into more of a storage systems offering overtime and how that fits with your strategy? Thanks.","","Steve Luczo","Yeah we\u2019re not going to respond to this second question because that could be too closely related to the Xyratex\u2019s acquisition, I rather just not tread that line while we\u2019re under review. On the first one I think we\u2019re confident that the data growth rates are still in excess of 30%. Again I think it comes back to infrastructure that\u2019s being installed and deployed relative to original expectation. So we will have to keep an eye on it. The industry does a great job obviously of keeping track of the Exabytes it ships but that\u2019s not quite the same as the Exabytes that have been put in production by the various cloud companies and we\u2019re trying to get a better handle on that directly with some of the relationships we have been through our OEMs but we still believe the growth rates are in excess of 30% a year. I would expect that the average capacity per drive crosses over terabyte sometime this year and we always think about the cloud but again one of the biggest drivers of the average capacity per drive calculations, what\u2019s going on in the consumer front? You know where people are taking 2 and 3 and 4 terabyte drives into their homes pretty rapidly and we see that continuing as well. So we are still a lot confident that we have good growth in average capacity per drive and that we have petabyte growth rates in excess of aerial density growth rates, which puts pressure on us from an ability to deliver the petabytes required.","","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great. And then just real quick, in terms of the PC industry serve this bottoming that we have all been talking, is there from your PC any differences in terms of client versus enterprise we should pay attention to over the next couple of quarters? Thanks a lot.","","Steve Luczo","I mean, yes, it\u2019s been bottoming for a while, I am not sure what a bottom is when it\u2019s been bottoming for five or six quarters, but it does feel overall, I would say, it feels better, demand feels better. And maybe on a relative basis, it feels better in client than it has, but I\u2019d say across the board, business feels a little better. The caveat I would put on it is in the last five years, its felt better three to four times and it seems to have always felt better right about now. And then right about May or June, it feels not as better. So I am hopeful because it hasn\u2019t felt like this in a while I guess. I don\u2019t know that last year it felt better at this time. So I think in that sense, I am encouraged or we are encouraged, but we are cautious that we can always flex to the upside. Again, the industry in this range of whether or not it\u2019s 132 or 144 that\u2019s easy for the company, the industry to respond to. So \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we are going to break out from that one way or the other this quarter or probably next. So we are pretty cautious things from how we are going to plan our production. That being said, it probably feels better than it has in the last couple of years. And maybe the relative strength is in the client that might reflect a better macroeconomic condition for regular people instead of just big governments and big companies that could borrow at zero percent and buy the stuff they need to keep the companies and governments running.","","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Great, thank you very much.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to dig into the expenses this quarter a little bit higher than I think at least I was expecting, I know you have commented Steve that they are going to be up a little bit, they are going to be flat next quarter, can you give us a little detail on why they were up and do you expect them to come back down into your targeted range of 12% to 14% of revenue in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.","","Steve Luczo","I will let Pat handle that.","","Pat O\u2019Malley","Yes. So, sure, yes, I do expect to come back down as you see in the financials, we have talked about last quarter doing a little reshaping, so we certainly went off to reshape the P&L where we took minor restructuring charge, but we continue to shape that to stick in the 12% to 14%, but we do want to continue to make some investments as Steve and Rocky commented on getting deeper relationship with the customers, that\u2019s just not in the go-to-market, but that\u2019s also in a technology engagements, whether it\u2019s IP, whether it\u2019s working with them or whether it\u2019s product offering, that\u2019s all in front of us. So I think there is good opportunity. So we are going to keep those investments. The other small piece about that is that we have a deferred comp trust that you had some about $5 million to $6 million more in OpEx this quarter than you normally would have that offsets an OIE, so that\u2019s \u2013 that will disappear, so that will be normalized in the future. So that was a little harder, but that wasn\u2019t really P&L harder, that was just a category. So what we do, we are committed to that 12% to 14% and we see some of these investing\u2019s for a good business model or revenue stream in the future, that\u2019s why we are going to keep those investments.","","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you. And then just I just want to need a little more detail on your SSD strategy, I know we talked about hybrids, but maybe if you give us some detail on what you are seeing with your SSDs and how that\u2019s going? Thanks.","","Rocky Pimentel","Sure. This is Rocky Pimentel. So we continue to make great progress on our organic SSD initiatives. We also have a very robust portfolio of inorganic initiatives on the SSD side. We look at our solid state storage business as a portfolio. So it\u2019s the pure SSDs plus the success in the hybrid. And on the hybrid side, we have been succeeding in not just the client level, but also at the low end of the enterprise level on hybrid adoption. So what we are looking at is a complete portfolio, but believe me we are making serious investments in our organic efforts on the pure SSD side. We continue to make progress, did design wins and some of our inorganic portfolio opportunities are really looking interesting and as they mature we plan to share a little bit more detail about them but at this point I think we feel a need for some confidentiality due to competitive concerns and so we will keep those things under tap until a future day.","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","I was wondering if you could give us your view on cash priorities for calendar \u201914 and maybe talk a little bit about what we should expect for allocation between dividend and buybacks in","\u201914? And then maybe just lastly comment on sort of how you think about share repurchase, does it meet through the year? Thanks a lot.","","Steve Luczo","So obviously our biggest message is returning the best fashion of capital to shareholders and given as we have talked about we are pretty much on target for the 7% this year so that\u2019s important. Now giving guidance for next year obviously the dividend in a buyback program will be active. We do have an active buyback program, authority to do so and it will remain active. Now the split and how we\u2019re going to manage that, we will probably look over the course the remaining part of this fiscal year for June and will get more clarity but I think what your reference is we had it go 250 obviously that was put in place when stock price was well different from it's today but we\u2019re still committed to the stock buyback program and the dividend and both of them will be vehicles as Steve also alluded we will continue to look at opportunities whether it's an IP or other assets that we will look at but that\u2019s all we will probably be needed on it and we will stay committed to the 70% but this share will probably come with greater clarity in due time on how we want to breakout the dividend and the buyback.","","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","I guess and just second one for me. How should we think about free cash flow generation or how you\u2019re thinking about in \u201914 you know cash conversions like all you know think you can do to grow free cash flow?","","Steve Luczo","I think right now our cash conversion side we\u2019re pretty comfortable, could move it for a couple of more days we could but as Dave said we\u2019re managing the inventory on just the tactical but a strategic where we want to setup some things. I think we have a good understanding of the cash flow on the margin it might change a couple of days but for the cash flow I don\u2019t think you should plan up difference than you\u2019ve seen recently. As Dave talked about, we\u2019re living in the world sort of a set range and we\u2019re committed to staying in a target margin range and for the products that continue to generate the cash flow you\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters.","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.","","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","First question on the Kinetic solution maybe can you talk about just sampling or is it solution in the produce type stage and when they expect the revenue recognition? And also since the solution competes with often kind of storage OEMs. Do you think it's going to impact your relationship with the storage OEMs?","","Dave Mosley","I will say couple of things firstly we\u2019re shipping this is the technology development platform right now so we\u2019re shipping it largely to a developers community. There is a lot of interest amongst customer base but we ship 6000 CTUs [ph] now so that people can get developing on these platforms that is not usually one drive at a time since it's a network drive. Their (indiscernible) a number of these things together but there is a lot of software host level development that has to happen in order to enable solution. So the cycle if you will the developmental cycle has been very long to that host side. A lot of people have a lot of interest because they see the opportunity to save money on the host side. Does it challenge our customers? Architecturally it challenges but I think at the end of the day some of those architectures need to be challenged for lower, lower cost. The host will enable the architectures and also the drive. Architecture is still, you know I think the customer ultimately once the, since the whole development platform matures then those customers will be able to take advantage of it and deploy it as they seek it.","","Rocky Pimentel","This is Rocky Pimentel just to add on to Dave\u2019s comments, with our existing cloud service provider customers and our OEMs customers are clearly very interested and have cost [ph], as Dave mentioned I think also an emerging set of customers in the telecom space and the content delivery network space and also coming to the forefront team, this is a big opportunity for their future infrastructures as well. So it\u2019s a pretty exciting space for us to get new customer.","","Steve Luczo","Yes, a lot of work left to do I think, but it\u2019s going to be quite some time before we monetize it.","","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Then as a follow-up, I mean, on the Analyst Day, you talked about organic revenue growth target 3% to 4%, it depends it\u2019s kind of in the units which you talked about 130 to 140ish moving units, do you think it is still possible to realize that revenue growth?","","Pat O\u2019Malley","This is Pat. Over time, absolutely, because we fundamentally believe in the data storage trends out there that Steve talked about that the deployment maybe somewhat soft one quarter, stronger the next, but over a period of time, it will show up. And as folks deploy this capital and start utilizing and filling these up, that\u2019s going to drive more growth. And so as it sits today, we are probably living in this range and we will continue to live in this range, but longer term, we do think it breaks out eventually clearly in the storage, how much storage we are shipping, but that eventually the industry is going to have to make some investments in capacity that we have made for the last several years.","","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham. Please proceed.","","Rich Kugele - Needham","Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from me. In terms of share count Pat for the fiscal third quarter what should we be assuming? And then on the OpEx side, is the guidance flat in absolute dollars relative to the second quarter or should we be backing out the incentive comp?","","Pat O\u2019Malley","So you could back out there incentive comp, Rich and outside that would be relatively flat. And then on the diluted shares for next quarter that is 2.41 [ph].","","Rich Kugele - Needham","Okay. And then lastly just Steve conceptually as you look at your exabyte shipments and the growth of that relative to your aerial density improvements within Seagate, would you expect that you would be able to outpace the industry\u2019s ability to ship exabytes with drives like the 6 terabyte, is that what the extra OpEx is going through, any thoughts on over the next four quarters how Seagate trends relative to aerial density growth on the exabyte side?","","Steve Luczo","No, I don\u2019t think. I think the industry is competitive across the board in terms of how it invest in the aerial density, if you will have not just for me to say, yes, we are better than those guys. I think the industry is working as hard as they can to drive aerial density in this 20% range, which is not enough to keep up with the demand side. We hope to do it better than our competitors whether or not, that shows up in aerial density or quality or costs or all three or responsiveness which is where we tend to be quite good as responsiveness in the quarter. I think the OpEx investments are in some of these areas, other areas that we pointed out which related to the mobile and cloud and open source side, you saw some of what we have been on the mobile side both within our own technology as well some of the announcements made at CES. So I think those opportunities are little different.","I think the storage industry is in this beneficial phase right now where the opportunities in front of the providers of storage devices are pretty significant and they are pretty broad. And I think each company will probably pursue them a little bit differently as a result. So as a result it may not be as easy to say well, WD Hitachi looks like this and Seagate looks like that and Toshiba looks like that, but I think each of these companies is going to take advantage of their own skills and leverage those into an opportunity set that\u2019s pretty broad. And so for us, we are investing in some OpEx areas that laid again, we have been transparent about but they relate to mobile, cloud and open source, but we haven\u2019t been so transparent, because we view it as highly competitive in terms of how we are going about taking advantage of the long-term trends. But to your base question, we believe it\u2019s absolutely fundamental that we remain competitive and hopefully the leader in our core technology of HDD, hybrid and SSDs. So, yes, we have a lot of investment going in that area and then we have others investments surrounding those areas that as we are successful there, will allow us to broaden our value proposition to a widening customer base.","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Schmidt with Morgan Stanley.","","Scott Schmidt - Morgan Stanley","Aside from the test equipment with Xyratex, you see other areas of opportunity to further vertically integrate or make further supply chain improvements and maybe as a follow-up on that I think a while back if we go post the flood there was a certain amount of com componency [ph] or sourcing externally. Is there an update on that? Anything else that can drive further margin improvement?","","Steve Luczo","I think what we focus on more is continuing of supply and obviously if the market went up a lot then we have to ask ourselves this questions right now the model is not going to change relative to how much we outsource, it will be more discussions about continuity supply.","","Dave Mosley","I think the lessons of the flood and the tsunami, earthquake before that really have to do with the systems that we put in place with our suppliers and with our customers and those have been big investments that we will continue to make. I mean we do believe that we have driven a fair amount of operational efficiency as a result of some of those programs and we think there is more to come. So accelerating the flow of the technology from our supplier base to our factories to our customers, saves everyone a lot of money and I think Seagate has made real progress but it's also, it's taken big investments in people, in technology and systems and even investments in our suppliers and in our customers from an engineering perspective and IT perspective and time spent So, I think that will continue.","","Scott Schmidt - Morgan Stanley","Got it and just if I can follow-up on the branded business. Can you just talk about whether the strength came from more the retail side of things or if you\u2019re seeing some strength in the SMB NAS Market and what the kind of margin profile of that is or implication of that is?","","Rocky Pimentel","This is Rocky Pimentel again, definitely strengthen in the NAS side of the business in retail or in branded. I would say we did well in the December quarter despite the fact we felt we could have had a stronger portfolio. We were late in one of our critical ramps in the branded business. It's a high capacity product and which could have brought better margins to the portfolio for branded and as we enter this quarter that weakness has been remediated and so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how we can compete in the marketplace at the high end which is a margin rich sector of the branded retail business.","","Steve Luczo","Can we take one more question?","","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.","","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","I want a follow on branded here and focusing on the consumer side than the NAS side. Are you seeing an appetite for consumers upgrading to what is effectively a personal cloud offering rather than simple backup drive? And I might have a follow-up question based on that answer.","","Rocky Pimentel","No question, consumers are very interested in NAS solutions at the home level. I mean this is an opportunity for growth in the future which we\u2019re pretty excited about you will see more and more of our product announcements around that. We talk about release of our most recent wireless drive at CES, under the LaCie brand which is really a great production. So no question if that\u2019s a category that will continue to grow in the branded retail space.","","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","So what do you feel can be the incremental TAM opportunity as consumers take that wireless product effectively in personal cloud?","","Steve Luczo","We don\u2019t put specific numbers on it. It's still an emerging segment of the branded retail TAM I mean direct attached storage is still it's a bigger segment of that TAM but we still, we see definitely shifts more towards NAS capable retail solutions and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to declare million to unit next quarter but this quarter but it's a growing demand by the consumer that we will try to service to the best of our ability.","","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","It does appear you know as people expand the eco-system with tablets and use those devices more and more that the attach rate for tablets is much higher than it was for desktop or high-capacity notebooks. There is some market data that shows those attach rates are in the 50% range versus rates I think more in the 10% to 15% range for the desktop side. Notebook side maybe was 15% to 20%. So we do see a big shift in attach rates there. And then what becomes a NAS versus a DAS is an interesting question when you have a bunch of wireless devices. So, yes, we think there is opportunity there, but again for us I think it\u2019s just part of the expanding ecosystem and these mobile devices obviously need storage, because there is not a lot you can do even if you are rich person, you can buy a 64-gig tablet, you can gobble that up pretty quickly and you have to store all that great high-def video somewhere. So it\u2019s our job to make sure that the technology we deliver is easy to use. I think that\u2019s where the industry probably hasn\u2019t done well. And competitively where you probably see both of the major players, WD and Seagate focusing a lot of energy, Seagate through both LaCie and our brand, WD through both of their brands, but I think clearly the ease of use issues around managing storage for your connected devices is a big opportunity for all of us and to the extent that we are successful it should drive significant amount of revenues and profits, if not tens of millions of units.","","Steve Luczo","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick - Seagate Technology Plc","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Morton Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our March 2018 quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com.","During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter, provide the company's outlook for the June quarter, and then open the call for questions. We're planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.

Please go ahead, Dave.","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the March quarter. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter.","I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the March quarter reflect year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, GAAP gross margins of 30.2%, and a net income of $381 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.31. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.8%, net income of $424 million, up 29% year over year, and a diluted earnings per share of $1.46, up 33% year over year.","HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 87.4 exabytes, up 34% year over year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.4 terabytes per drive, up 32% year over year. And the average selling price per unit was $70.50, up 6% year over year.","GAAP operating expenses were $406 million, down 26% year over year. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $385 million, down 13% year over year.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $558 million, up 31% year over year. And free cash flow was $489 million, up 48% year over year. Fiscal year to date, we have achieved cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion.","Achieving year-over-year revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the March quarter reflects Seagate's strong business model execution. I am pleased with the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise and edge markets and with the competitiveness of our entire HDD portfolio that aligns with trending data growth opportunities.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities.","David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Dave.","For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability, and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.","In the March quarter, total revenues were up 5% year over year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 7% year over year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments.","For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 43.8 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.8 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 41.3 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes per drive, up 41% over last year and up 64% from the March quarter two years ago.","Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10-terabyte nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the March quarter. In addition, we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product as we ramp for material revenue contribution.","As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the March quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, gaming, and network-attached storage.","The March quarter non-hard disk drive revenues, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, were $217 million, up 2% sequentially. Year over year, the non-hard disk drive revenues were down 13%, primarily due to the planned end of life of some legacy OEM cloud systems products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.","Silicon revenues were up a few percentage points year over year, and we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with the Toshiba Memory Corporation, as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SAS, SSD, PCIe, NVMe, consumer, and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions.","We believe that our strategic approach to participate in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth opportunities in our business model without the overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.","At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. In the March quarter, these products represented less than 8% of consolidated revenue.","Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality, and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products.","Over the last five years, we've been the leader in areal density with our perpendicular, shingled, and two-dimensional magnetic recording areal density solutions. These recording technologies continue to provide measurable total cost of ownership advantages for the mass storage market over other memory-based technologies, particularly for cloud-based environments.","We continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording technology. This next-generation recording platform will open up a rich design space for high-capacity nearline drives that will push capacity points up 24 terabytes per drive and beyond and offer great economic value for our customers. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in volume in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model.","Operating expenses for the March quarter were $406 million on a GAAP basis and $385 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 13% year over year. Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million in the March quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures to remain below 5% of total consolidated revenue.","Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $558 million and free cash flow was $489 million. Year to date, we have generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operations and nearly $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was five days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.","Over the last two years, we have made many changes to optimize our operational footprint and supply chain management. Product complexity is a significant challenge in the storage marketplace right now and we believe our agility and manufacturing responsiveness within the component supply chain provides a significant competitive advantage for Seagate.","Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5, 2018.","Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the March quarter, we deployed $57 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt to last 12 months EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is under one times as of the March quarter.","As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. We work with technology customers, vendors and suppliers throughout the world. In the area of tax and trade, the U.S. and China have recently announced potential trade actions that could increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S. Given the fluid nature of the issue, it is too speculative to determine any impact or changes for Seagate's operations. However, we continue to monitor the situation.","Overall, our operational and financial performance in the March quarter reflects solid earnings power and financial leverage within our business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to align our go-to-market operations and product portfolio advancements for growth in the existing mass storage markets. Over the long term, we believe there will be additional growth opportunities with new markets and customers that will leverage our cost-efficient and reliable storage technologies.","I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley.","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Dave.","Turning to our market outlook, we remain optimistic about Seagate's earnings power, as current macroeconomic conditions and global investments in cloud-based environments persist. Specific to the nearline products, we share the perspective that we are in the early stages of a broad-based global cloud storage transformation.","For the June quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte, and profitability growth, with continued strong enterprise demand and tight supply for our highest capacity solutions. Within the other markets we serve, we anticipate sequential seasonal unit demand declines, as we would typically see in the June quarter. It is important to note, however, that exabyte demand is growing year over year in nearly all markets.","As a result of these exabyte demand trends, we expect total revenues to be approximately flat, sequentially, from the March quarter, reflecting quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 17% and total revenue growth of approximately 4% for fiscal 2018.","We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the March quarter and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Cash flow from operations for the June quarter should be at least $500 million, and we are on track to achieve over $2 billion in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.","Based upon our trajectory for our overachievement of our fiscal year 2018 plan, we anticipate an increase in variable compensation for employees for annual performance in the June quarter. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly, and we anticipate overall non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 1% to 2%.","Looking further ahead, feedback from our largest enterprise customers in all regions indicates strong capacity demand will continue throughout the calendar year. In addition, we anticipate seasonal strength in our other markets, with particularly strong exabyte growth in edge markets in the second half.","Diverse markets that are exhibiting strong data storage requirements translate to continued favorable growth and profitability opportunities for Seagate. We believe these long-term trends will continue with existing customers and that new customers and business vertical opportunities are also on the horizon.","In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners, and employees for their alignment and contributions to the March quarter's results.","Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the head and disk constraints you might be facing and whether you've had to reallocate some of your supply chain towards faster growing markets. And if that's the case, have you lost any share on client, and how do you think that continues throughout the rest of the calendar year? Thank you.","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","As you're alluding to, Steven, head and disk lead times can be quite long, and we have to make sure that we have the right capacity in place for the right markets at the right times of the year due to their seasonality. So I think we executed our plan pretty well on client, and enterprise continues to remain strong. That's pulling, frankly, quite a few heads and disks. So I wouldn't say that there was any share loss or anything that was untoward for us.","We pretty much executed the client plan. We knew it was going to be seasonally down. We said that actually going in. And then we'll continue to point more and more heads and media at the high-capacity opportunities throughout the course of the year. And as we continue to see strength there, we'll try to ramp that up and apply more and more resources to it to try to meet that demand.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. And as a quick follow-up on the client side, as you move away from more of the 1-terabyte and below, is there a chance that maybe you raise that bar and are looking at possibly 2 terabytes and below as your hurdle for getting involved in client?","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","In some of our comments in the script, especially in the desktop markets, you're seeing fragmentation of the market. And some particular parts of the market, for example, surveillance, it's exhibiting seasonality in units, but the demand for higher capacity keeps going up. So exactly to your point, we are seeing people moving from 1 terabyte and 2 terabytes as their baseline offering to 2 terabytes, 4 terabytes, 8 terabytes, and so on. And we'll have to answer that with technology for areal density technology or heads and media of the same length.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thank you, guys, for taking the question. Can you guys hear me okay?","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","Yes.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Hey, congrats on strong performance and executing well in difficult market conditions. Dave, I would just love to get a little more context on the comments around cloud trends and I guess high capacity trends in general. It sounds like maybe the momentum actually continues to pick up there. We are (20:50), but it sounds like momentum may even be a picking up. And you made comments about strength in not just the second half of the year, but I think you made a multiyear comment as well. Could you just \u2013 number one, is it accurate that the momentum continues to build? And then, secondarily, any thought process around what's leading to second half conviction? Is an (21:20) even view the strength continues into calendar year 2019 would be really helpful. Thanks.","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","Good. Thanks, Ananda. So if you remember the history of the nearline markets in the last five years, there's been periods where we misinterpreted it as seasonality, but there were periods of feast and famine, if you will. The market \u2013 generally, the exabytes were increasing at about a 35% CAGR, but there were some markets sometimes where the market was much faster than that and other times where it slowed down. We're starting to see that abate and the demand be a lot more predictable, longer lead time visibility. And some of that's because the build-out of major cloud installations pulling really hard on high-capacity drives is not as feast or famine, anymore.","I think behind that, and this is something that is still developing a little bit, are the more legacy technologies for on-prem or smaller data centers where the capacity points aren't necessarily the highest capacity points, so we'll say 8 terabytes and below, but the demand is quite strong and quite diverse, geographically. So from my perspective, that strength actually picked up middle of last year and feels strong through the back half of this calendar year as well.","Looking out into calendar year 2019, I think it may be a little bit premature. We'll see the size of the back half of this year first, but it's certainly feeling like the install patterns that most of the cloud service providers and some of these big on-prem companies are in the middle of are still very healthy. And so, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it does extend for another year.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. I'll (23:24).","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. Enterprise revenue is at record mix, 44% this quarter, and yet gross margins are only up the middle of your long-term range and up just slightly, sequentially. And so, what's holding back gross margins? And then, if in your answer you can comment on whether you saw any improvement in the non-HDD gross margin in the quarter. And I have a quick follow-up.","David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc","Hi, Katy, it's Dave Morton. So in regards to our gross margins, I'd also like to remind everybody that sequential quarter we also had some production reductions. We were down total volume build-wise. And this is probably the only time I'll talk absolute units, but build-wise, total volumes were down about 4% to 5%. And so, if you think about the absorption loss from that, that added some headwinds.","If you look at it from a year-over-year basis, though, however, absolute gross margin dollars were up approximately $50 million. And so, that's where you're really starting to see the expansion due to the changes from your client\/server more so to the mobility cloud and with the build-out of these workloads and these streams. I'd also remind you that our 12 TB is still ramping aggressively into material volume contributions, and so we had some startup costs associated with that as well. So all in all, great quarter by the team, specifically in operations.","In regards to some of our non-hard disk drive contributors to our top line revenue, we did see some small incremental margin accretion there. However, we still have some further optimization to go. We spoke about the Toshiba Memory Corporation alignment coming online. That will provide us some margin opportunities in the back half of this year. And then, we still have some near-term opportunities within our Systems group as well.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is there any line of sight in terms of getting the non-HDD gross margins up closer to corporate average? Is that possible in the next 12 months, or is that a longer-term goal?","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","I think it's a longer-term \u2013 this is Dave Mosley, by the way, Katy. I think it's a longer-term goal than that. From our perspective, we're staging a lot of resources to be able to intercept these markets. But I think the growth of those markets, for us at least, will be longer-term than that to hit margin parity.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. The first question is on the nearline market. Certainly, we're seeing the positive view throughout the year and potentially into 2019, but I think there are comments about being capacity constrained as well, and specifically within the nearline market. And I was hoping you could help us understand why you think you may be able to ship bits in line with demand.","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","I think we're going to have to answer the call \u2013 this is to my earlier comments. We're going to have to answer the call with areal density solutions. As far as components, the constraints are pretty tight right now in operations. We can pivot and I think a previous question alluded to this. We can pivot from some of the client markets, but that will be delicate because the lead times are fairly long on some of those decisions. But we're trying our best to go answer it. We'll probably stage not any footprint changes, but a little bit more capital directed at the nearline markets within our budgets and try to answer it as much as we can. The big question for us, the big question for everyone I think that everyone's asking is how long is it going to last and how big is the peak? And I think right now we just see strong demand through the back half of this calendar year.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And for a follow-up on OpEx, I understood the comments about some investing coming in. The company had a target to get to $375 million of non-GAAP OpEx exiting this fiscal year. Can you just talk about where that stands and to what extent you can still hold disciplined OpEx levels in the back half of the calendar year?","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","That's good. We've driven all the actions \u2013 this is from a time about a year and half ago when we set a bogey and said this is the footprint that we needed to be in. We've driven all the actions to get there, and we're still on that same trajectory. Obviously, with some of these opportunities, there are some near-term, I'll call them, materials challenges around some of the new product launches that we could actually launch faster and get it to market and then answer the question on areal density even quicker to get after revenue.","So we're in that mode right now of looking what our near-term opportunities are. We do want that footprint to be still maintained the same through the back half of this year. So we're trying everything that we can to meet all the market demand, at the same time staying inside the footprint that we worked so hard to get to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, just a quick question. On the Enterprise SSD business, it's still quite small. I guess it was up a little bit year over year. But what does it take to build momentum there? Is a lot of that tied to the planned Toshiba deal? Is that the big change going forward, or what else can you do there to get that business growing? Thanks.","William David Mosley - Seagate Technology Plc","Yes, from our perspective, one of the things that has hindered us in the past is the fact that we're always changing either the NAND supply from vendor to vendor or even from process node to process node inside of that vendor, and that's fairly disruptive. So I think in general, the customers like us, but they realize the journey we've been on and actually a lot of people have been on with all this disruption to the NAND supply. So having longer-term visibility and a more stable, predictable supply chain is key to growth in that area.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO, Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO, Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology and Phil Brace, President, Cloud Systems and Silicon Group.","We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our second fiscal quarter 2016 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the quarter, provide the company outlook for the third fiscal quarter 2016 and then open the call for questions.","We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our second fiscal quarter results reflect in line performance in revenues and margins and outperformance on the committed cost control measures. For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $3 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 25.6%, net income of $246 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.82.","Our HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 60.6 exabytes, up 10% sequentially. Within this, enterprise exabyte shipments were up 21% sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our high-capacity enterprise products. Average capacity per enterprise drive was a new record of 2.2 terabytes, up 15% year-over-year.","Non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $453 million. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced a quarterly expense run rate by almost $100 million or 17% reflecting reductions around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 5% with improved linearity and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.","Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $382 million and free cash flow was $245 million, equating to free cash flow of $0.81 per diluted share. Fiscal year to-date, we have generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and forecast cash flow from operations to be approximately $500 million for the March quarter.","Our capital returned to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate and we continue to balance the effective investment in our storage technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework. There has been no change to our capital allocation policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter works comfortably within our cash flow generation forecast.","We have redeemed 23 million shares fiscal year to-date and considering the macro economic empowerment and investor sentiment, we view the stock as being attractive at these levels. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 296 million shares outstanding.","Our debt structure and level of interest expense is manageable, particularly in light of whatever technology companies have done and\/or are planning to do in the public markets. Seagate is focused on maximizing our opportunities in areas of the storage market that will position us to grow our topline, optimize the value of our core technology, continue to generate strong cash flow and create value for shareholders.","Our specific areas of near-term activity for Seagate's management team are around our product portfolio monetization, operational efficiencies and continued financial discipline. Throughout the decades of storage technology innovation at Seagate, we have maintained a high priority on investing in R&D and acquiring the right assets to provide the most reliable, cost-effective and workload optimized storage products for customers.","Market demand for storages across multiple forms and locations, including on-premise for performance, in the cloud for availability and directly on purpose built and market devices. We have many new products designed for these different workloads, including HDDs, cloud systems and flash technology products.","In the nearline market, we have begun the initial ramp of our 10 terabyte Helium product and we are shipping our eight terabyte conventional products in high volume. We continue to believe high capacity enterprise demand will grow in calendar 2016 and our portfolio improvements position us well for full participation in this market.","Surveillance and video applications are growing rapidly and they are seeing strong demand for our products specifically designed for these workloads. Our retail, gaming and client offerings are continuing to move to higher capacity points and are benefiting from the recent launch of products with industry leading areal density.","In October, we acquired Dot Hill Systems for our cloud systems business and later in the quarter, the divestiture sale of EVault was announced. We believe this strategy positions us to leverage a broader storage systems and all flash array portfolio across a more focused set of storage OEM customers and channel partners. In addition, our ClusterStor high-performance compute end-to-end system solutions continue to gain traction in a high performance compute market and we are excited about several vertical market opportunities we are targeting with our channel partners.","We recently announced products at the Supercomputing 15 show. That included a workload optimization HPC drive, emphasizing our direction to create solutions using all elements of Seagate's portfolio. Seagate's flash technology product portfolio has grown significantly over the last two years and includes enterprise SAS SSDs, PCIe accelerator cards, SATA controllers, all flash arrays and hybrid HDDs. In December, we had strong quarter in our PCIe business and we announced sampling of or PCIe and VME product set. Our enterprise SAS SSD qualification activities continue to be on track and are in evaluations with multiple customers.","Combined, we are planning for our cloud storage systems and silicon business to exit fiscal year 2016 at a revenue run rate of over $1 billion a year. This will position us for continued success and profitability in fiscal year 2017, as several areas of these markets are projected to grow double digits over the next few years. Through the expansion of our HDD portfolio and new business adjacencies, we are having success in broadening our global hyperscale customer base and strengthening our channel partners.","To best serve our customers and improve operational efficiencies within our marketplace and functions, we announced in January the alignment of our global markets and customers organization under Dave Mosley. We thank Rocky Pimental for his leadership of our sales and marketing organization and we will continue to benefit from his strategic insights in his role as an Executive Vice President. Personally, I am looking forward to working with our executive team over the next several years as we continue to lead Seagate in serving growing global customer base, expanding our storage portfolio, striking our competitive position and optimizing our business for continued financial performance.","Turning to our business outlook. In the last several quarters, we have discussed our concerns over global economic conditions, particularly in Europe and China, which have proven accurate and we believe will persist at least through June this calendar year. While we are cognizant of the ongoing challenges of the macroeconomic environment, the IT transformational shifts presents significant opportunities for us to continue to be a leader in core storage technology and deliver value to shareholders.","As we align our storage product portfolio to capitalize upon these market dynamics, our revenue opportunities are shifting with hyperscale customers continuing to drive strong exabyte growth with capital expenditure compounded annual growth rates of 40%. At the same time, our exposure to the traditional PC client market is changing and now represents less than 35% of total revenue.","In light of these macro conditions and technology shifts, we took purposeful and thoughtful action last year to reduce our operating expenses and evaluated areas where investments were not paying off, resulting in measurable operating expense reduction and cost control implementation across our business. Taking into account macroeconomic factors, we believe overall storage market demand will be seasonally down in the March quarter which has ranged between 5% and 10% over the last five years. We are planning for revenues to be approximately $2.7 billion, which reflects the high end of the seasonal demand trend and operating expenses to be sequentially flat.","We are forecasting cash flow from operations for the March quarter to be sequentially higher at approximately $500 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP gross margins will be sequentially flat in the March quarter and ongoing activities that will improve our profitability, including raising prices in certain markets, aggressive product transitions and internal and external supply chain optimization such as reducing manufacturing capacity. Based on these factors and expected growth in the nearline storage market, we still expect that our gross margins will be in our target range of 27% to 32% for the June quarter.","I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support as well as our shareholders and are now ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the gross margin improvement. You guys did a good job on managing that this quarter. How much of that was driven by the ramp of your eight terabyte drives and a more positive mix in your business? And how much of that was related to cost reduction actions?","Dave Mosley","Hi, Sherri. We are taking aggressive cost reduction actions, but the ramp of the nearline products and re-equilibrating versus what we saw in Q1 was pretty substantial. Nearline went up about 11% in exabytes quarter-over-quarter. That's 18% year-over-year and a lot of that is being driven by sixes and eights moving hard and we will continue that into this quarter as well. So it's pretty profound there.","Sherri Scribner","And then maybe could I ask a quick question on the capacity business and the hyperscale business. How do you see that ramping over with the year? I know that you have talked about strong build plans from the cloud providers, but I wanted to get a sense of what you are seeing now? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","We still believe that some of the cloud service providers are in hold back mode. There is lot of diversity in the Tier 2 buildout, but there are still people there with their capital budgets that are fairly conservative through this time. So we do see that in the back half of this year, some of them will come back into, not only scale out but also refresh of their existing data centers as well.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Sherri, just to further point out what Dave said, so the cost actions really in terms of how they impact COGS are really in the quarters to come more so than the improvement in the last quarter. That was more related, again, to mix and introducing some of these new products that are higher traction on the eight TB, but I think in terms of the margin improvement we see going forward we are pretty encouraged by what we see in terms of the cost actions related to capacity and supply chain optimization that will impact COGS going through rest of the calendar year.","Sherri Scribner","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Co. Your line is open.","Rich Kugele","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations actually in a tough environment. Maybe first, let's take a bigger picture view. With all the puts and takes competitively, some people are concerned about the overall drive business health. What do you see now competitively with the Seagate\/WD transaction? And even the potential Toshiba's exit in the space? And then I have a follow-up.","Dave Mosley","Well, I guess a couple of answers, Rich. I think in terms of the macro view on the industry, I still think the investing world is not quite grasping. The transition is around where storage is being stored. It's locale of the storage, just not the amount of what's being stored that's basically shifting and those are architectural implications. And architectural implications are actually enhancing the application. So it's feeding off of one another, but from every source of data that we have, we still have 95% to 98% of your bits are ultimately being stored on a disk drive or more.","As you know, cloud infrastructures usually replicate. So even though there is a reduced number of drives being in the client, the data being generated by the client is still ultimately stored on a disk drive. And as it turns out, it's exactly stored in a disk drive that is harder to make and takes more absorption in the factories in terms of number of heads and disk and the content in those heads and disk is quit a bit higher. So, from a manufacturer's perspective, it's a good thing because you are getting more absorption.","That being said, there is a lot of growth in the silicon related pieces of the business, not at the expense of the HDD business per se and that's an area that we are serious about obviously. We are building what we think is a very good business, both at the systems level and the device level. And it stands what we do with HDDs as well as how we incorporate various levels of silicon, all way up to all-flash arrays and other devices. So we like the overall storage business and we particularly like the fact that we think that the HDD business itself is going to benefit from the continued trend of more people being more connected, generating richer content.","So I think, to that point, when you look at the competitive aspects, the WD, SanDisk transaction is interesting on one level that it certainly is a huge endorsement of the HDD industry, because in order to pay back anywhere from $20 billion to $30 billion over seven to 10 years just for the debt, that has to come from the HDD business, because the flash business obviously has its own capital needs that are becoming more substantial because the technology shift they are facing.","So I think that's a big endorsement of, if WD can generate $20 billion, $30 billion over 10 years just to pay back debt and then you have to do capital and things on top of it, that sounds like a pretty good industry. And it's an industry that we think we are ahead technically, but if you want to say we are equal, that's fine. But it's also one that we are entirely focused now and we are not be cutting R&D.","And so when I look at the transaction, I do think it's tough to 40 times earnings for a company and finance it all with debt. I do think that the interest expense on that transaction is obviously 2X what it should have been or what was maybe expected to be six months ago. And it fell to us, like the operating expense reduction side of $1 billion were aggressive in light of the fact there is only $4 billion of OpEx to begin with and we have always viewed WD as a pretty lean organization.","So to say that there is $1 billion coming out of that business, that may be true but then some of it has got to be coming out of R&D. And that's not what we are doing. And so we believe investing in your core technology when at the product level and then on top of it there is this technology shift that as it does relate to our silicon business, we want to make sure that we have access to the best silicon technology and as we stack up the various players, you have Samsung as the clear leader, both in terms of capital and technology. They have announced their third fab, $17 billion, thank you, in 3D.","Hynix is doing great in 3D and we have good dialogue with them. Micron and Intel, leading with 3D XPoint. And 3D XPoint, of course Micron is a planar technology company as well. So we think our engagement with those companies which is quite active provides us access to the technology that we need to pursue our silicon strategy. And we do think that the recent shift in Toshiba's position on what they can do with planar does raise questions of how are they going to compete with companies that have two to 10 times the capital budgets. So we feel pretty good about the industry and we certainly feel about our relative position.","Rich Kugele","Excellent. Just one follow-up. In terms of, obviously with the dividend yield now north of 9%, people are concerned supposedly on your cash flow and your ability to continue to pay the dividend. Do you believe that your cost cutting actions that you have implemented and I guess will be finished by June, that you will be able to have that more than $1 billion in cash flow annually and be able to fully fund that dividend?","Steve Luczo","Yes. As I cited in the opening remarks, Rich, that our cash flow relative to our dividend payment is not concern for us at all.","Rich Kugele","Excellent. All right. Thank you very much.","Steve Luczo","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes. Thank you. Good Morning. Two questions, if I could. Steve, can you talk a little more about your exabyte trend line? It was down about 7% in the September quarter, roughly flat for December? Should we anticipate, just getting from your comments, around improvement and targeting higher cap, especially 10 terabyte, that we can see exabyte starting to actually grow in the first half of calendar 2016? And then kind of a follow-up part two of my question is that partly why you are saying you will raise pricing? Or is that comment more around like-for-like pricing and not pricing going up because of new schemes?","Steve Luczo","Yes. Let me answer your back question and then I may direct you to an offline discussion so we may have debate about growth rates. But the pricing is like-for-like in certain rate market rises .We are not talking mix. We are talking about prices that have to address the value of the products in a lot of the client space, it's just ridiculous. And I think I made this statement a year ago that the industry was not serving itself by subsidizing client products by trying sell more nearline products just say within the margin range, because this day would come that you don't have any room left. And I think now the industry is recognizing it. Whether or not you are making 10 points of margin on the client or five points, it is nowhere near 20 which is what some people cited and that's nowhere near what you need to basically fund the technology going forward. So there is going to have to be adjustments on the client side to reflect what we do.","So the price, I think, goes across certain markets and it's like-for-like. We show 10% growth sequentially in exabyte shipments for us, up to 60.6 exabytes. So I am not sure where that information is coming from that you are referencing. So instead of wasting time here --","Mark Moskowitz","I am talking year-over-year --","Steve Luczo","So instead of talking about it on this call, because we see growth in exabytes and in the nearline space, I would rather take it offline, because it is going to chew up too much time debating data right now. But as I said in the script, we have 10% up sequentially on exabytes shipped and our enterprise exabytes were up 21%. So we are encouraged by the mix up in the enterprise and in the cloud service providers.","Mark Moskowitz","Okay. Yes. I was talking about year-over-year, which pretty much dovetails with your numbers, but it sounds like you definitely feel good about that growth trend line and we can see it continue to be a positive, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.","Steve Luczo","Yes. We do believe that.","Mark Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. First real quickly I want to go back to Rich's question. I am curious on your thoughts on Toshiba as it relates to the hard disk drive business, given the recent news. And then also I was curious if you could just give us an update on the OpEx. I think in the past you talked about $460 million. Obviously you have done better than that. Is there further OpEx realignment? And then an update to that $460 million level exiting the fiscal year. Thank you.","Steve Luczo","I forgot to answer the Toshiba question. Thanks for re-asking it. Yes, I don't know. We can't predict what's going on at Toshiba. We can say that we have noticed a marked decline in their presence in certain markets and maybe part of what Nidec was seeing was reduced from them. We don't know and we actually don't really believe Nidec sees all its orders two weeks into the quarter anyhow. But look, it's obviously a difficult situation at Toshiba at the corporate level and clearly their number one priority is to save the fabs and it doesn't make sense to me that being in the drive business serves that purpose. But what they decide is up to them.","So if you had asked me where was my gauging of would Toshiba be in the business in the next one to three years today versus where was it six months or a year ago, I am much more towards the end that they are not going to be in this business in the next one to three years, just because I don't how I see how they can be competitively, given where areal density is going and given where manufacturing is and given some of their bigger corporate issues, I just can't imagine that that's where they want to spend their R&D expense or frankly their cash flow.","Aaron Rakers","And on the OpEx?","Dave Morton","On the OpEx side, Aaron, we did outperform. So we are ahead of where we said we would be and that was for exiting the fiscal year. I think we are happy at this level for now. We don't see a real reason to turn it down from here. We still have some ideas about how we might do that and still protect the product portfolio, but I think we are going to run the rest of the fiscal year at this level. And then we will see how the market develops in the next couple of quarters and see what we have do in FY2017.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Yes. Again, just to emphasize, Aaron, that's what my point was that we think the next focus of our effort is around issues that impact gross margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Thanks guys. Congrats on a really solid trend in a tough environment as well. Just a quick one for me. Steve, I would love to get your thoughts, again just sort of circling back on application set for flash and for flash storage systems. One of your largest customers, a couple of days ago on their earnings call seemed to make a point of putting more energy around their view that flash, flash based systems are going to increasingly address general application set. Your earlier comments on this call of the 95% to 98%, which I know is probably more of a historically data driven remark, but the way you spoke about it, seems to suggest that you believe that they can stay in that 95% to 98% range. Any sort of nuance being that you have with regards to flash systems and their ability to address general application sets, would love to hear that. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I don't think they are inconsistent. I think you have the opportunity for flash to address general application sets, but the data is still being stored disk drives. It's just a question of what it is moving in and out of. In the old days, it was moving in and out of a CPU. Now it's being staged in different levels of, call it memory or storage, that basically allow for greater and faster processing applied against it. But at the end of the day, that stuff rests on an HDD. So my point was, sure, that layer above is a layer that we want to participate on and through Phil's efforts, we feel we will be quite successful there. But it's not eliminating the fact that bit ends up on a disk drive. In fact, it's going into a disk drive that's a pretty sporty, as Dave would say. It's a nearline drive that has lots of heads and disks and a really complicated VLSI architecture. So those are all things that we get paid for.","Now, Phil, you want to talk a little bit more about what you are seeing?","Phil Brace","Yes. I think that, to echo Steve's comment, where we see a lot of the flash, I would say, is on the new tier, if you will, right. A performance tier that does accelerate things and generally speaking, it's in front of large arrays of storage, large banks of storage. And that's where we see a lot of the growth. And we are investing some of our energy. And it is around that performance area.","Steve Luczo","I was going to say, yes, I think in particular, as it relates to the super high performance, super high data rate, data processing applications like petro and some of the other energy applications, that's where our high-performance compute solution has been particularly strong because we really have the fastest system to feed those higher levels of, again, call it storage, call it memory. But somehow you have to have a back end that's serving that thing very well. And we have to be the leader in that space. And that leadership comes through partnerships as well as some great companies like Cray and Teradata and others.","Ananda Baruah","Yes. That's great context. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot.","Steve Luczo","Great. Thanks. All right. We should probably have one last question.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland","Okay. Great. I guess a follow-up to this discussion. With some pressure on performance enterprise drives, 15K specifically and a tailwind in capacity drives, could you talk about your exposure to both? And if there is difference in the gross margin profile? Any significant difference between the two?","Dave Morton","This is Dave. No significant difference between the two. I would say that the 15k lines are still in demand. There are still a lot of people pulling, not to the levels that maybe they were historically, but not 50% of what they were historically yet and I think we anticipate a fairly long tail there because it still provides a fairly low cost good value hitting the price band that has got a compelling performance tier. And it's important to note that a lot of places that those drives go today, that cost performance trade-off is really compelling compared to any other solution. Maybe the choke point is somewhere else in the architecture. Now that said, it's a million or 1.5 million drives a quarter and at the scale of Seagate, that's pretty small. So if we redeflect those heads and disks into other boxes, that doesn't really have a material impact on Seagate.","Jayson Noland","Okay. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.","Steve Luczo","Yes. Thanks very much.","Steve Luczo","Okay. So just to wrap it up again, I guess we will again thank everyone and we look forward to speaking to you after the next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.","Steve Luczo","Thank you."],"18816":["Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) F4Q 2013 Earnings Conference Call July 24, 2013  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Kate Scolnick - Vice President, Investor Relations","Steve Luczo - Chief Executive Officer","Pat O'Malley - Chief Financial Officer","Rocky Pimentel - Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer","Dave Mosley - Executive Vice President, Operations","Ken Massaroni - Executive Vice President and General Counsel","Analysts","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Rob Cihra - Evercore","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley","Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Seagate Technology\u2019s Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Year End 2013 Financial Results Conference Call.

Joining me today in Dublin, Ireland are Seagate\u2019s executive team, our CEO, Steve Luczo, CFO, Pat O\u2019Malley, EVP of Sales and Marketing, Rocky Pimentel, EVP of Operations, Dave Mosley, and EVP and General Counsel, Ken Massaroni.","We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal fourth quarter and the year-end 2013 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today\u2019s call, we will review the highlights from the June quarter and provide the company\u2019s outlook for the fiscal first quarter 2014. After that, we will open up the call for questions.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements relating to the company\u2019s historical and currently anticipated future operating and financial performance in the September quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand in general market conditions.

These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company\u2019s view of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.","I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks Kate. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Seagate demonstrated strong operational performance in the June quarter achieving revenues of $3.4 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 28%, net income of $447 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.20. Bulk of our revenue and gross margin results for the quarter were higher, were at the higher end of our expectations, primarily driven by near line market demands, as a wide variety of customers deployed Cloud infrastructure and applications.","Full year fiscal 2013 revenues were $14.4 billion and on a non-GAAP basis we achieved gross margin of 28%, net income of $2 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $5.31. We met our shareholder capital return goals for the year returning 70% of operating cash flow, and 90% of free cash flow in the form of dividends and share redemptions. In addition we successfully restructured our debt profile this quarter to optimize Seagate\u2019s capital structure and to support the long term growth of the company reducing our annual interest expense by over $40 million. We ended the fiscal year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and 359 million ordinary shares outstanding.","Going forward we remain committed to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share redemptions. We have nearly completed our share redemption plans for the September quarter purchasing approximately 4 million shares in the month of July. For fiscal 2014 we are targeting to return upto 70% of operating cash flow and upto 90% of free cash flow to shareholders.","Our senior management is pleased that Seagate executed well in a time of change, uncertainty and opportunity over the course of fiscal year 2013. In addition to meeting the vast majority of our financial goals we successfully enhanced and expanded our storage technology portfolio through organic growth, partnership and acquisition to position us for future success with an expanding base of customers. For the cloud market we introduced several new enterprise products and features designed to specifically address the manageability, performance, total cost of ownership and security requirements for these environments. We\u2019re particularly excited about the opportunities of our new 4 terabyte near line product with a competitive combination of capacity and energy efficiency that customers are demanding.","We expanded our SSD solutions over the last several months to include our newest enterprise SSD that we developed with Samsung and we have strategic investments focused on the emerging enterprise PCIe market and key architecture advancements in next generation SSD technology.","In the mobile market we have introduced our 7 millimeter hybrid drives and 5 millimeter disk drives for thin and light and tablet computing. As the mobile market continues to evolve and expand we believe we\u2019re well positioned with competitive products that are high capacity, high performance and cost effective storage solutions.","And then in the branding market our acquisition of LaCie and new products such as Seagate Wireless Plus and Seagate Central has significantly boasted our external drives and personal cloud offerings for easy to use home storage solutions that we believe will continue to be in strong demand.","Over Seagate\u2019s history we have successfully invested in our technology portfolio to deliver the industry\u2019s highest standard of security, reliability and performance coupled with these efforts we have worked to make cost effective and well-timed capital investments to support our global manufacturing operations. In fiscal year \u201913 our capital expenditures were less than 6% of revenue and focused on maintenance investment for our existing infrastructure and improvements to our global manufacturing and R&D footprint including the Korea Design Center for our Samsung acquisition and planning for our improved media R&D center in Fremont, California.","In fiscal year \u201914, we expect our capital investments to remain within our long term targeted gains of 6% to 8% of revenue. Mobile and cloud will continue to be the priority areas where we are investing in our R&D efforts and aligning our technology portfolio and we expect our operating expenses to remain relatively flat. At the same time maintaining our product gross margin is a key priority at Seagate which will enable us to make the investments required for advancement of our technology portfolio. For the past several quarters our model has proven to be effective for us to leverage both market opportunities and manage through uncertainty.","We will continue to work to balance near term financial performance with long term strategic development or maximizing shareholder value. We remain mindful on the uncertainties affecting our industry including macroeconomic factors, monetary policies, government spending and the technology transition that\u2019s taking place particularly in mobile computing.","For the September quarter we believe the demand environment will be moderately, sequentially and we expect revenues of approximately 3.5 billion to 3.6 billion and non-GAAP gross margins to remain relatively flat.","In summary, we believe Seagate is well positioned for this era of data growth and technology transformation. We are optimistic about our leadership position in product portfolio and technology, and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our Investor Meeting on September 10.","On behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees for meeting our operational goals for the fiscal year and positioning Seagate for ongoing success in fiscal year 2014. I also want to thank our customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders for continued support and commitment. We are now ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele representing Needham & Company. Please proceed.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Good morning. Just a couple of questions from me. I guess, first on the long-term trajectory for your business. It seems you have intentionally focused on the enterprise and some of the other higher capacity opportunities can you just talk about perhaps long-term, Steve, what you think two years out your mix might be between enterprise and all of the flavors, retail and client?","Steve Luczo","I think it\u2019s probably more corporate we talked about that at the Investor Day, Rich, where we are talking about our longer term strategic vision.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay, I will hop off of that. And then more near-term to the enterprise hybrid that you launched, can you just talk about how you think that, that will work into the product line of the customer interest, would you expect most of your OEMs to move to that or is that for a specific subset of the client of the customer side?","Dave Mosley","Yes, Rich, this is Dave. I can give you some flavor of that. So, obviously we know a lot about enterprise workloads, because we have been studying the drive from the markets for that are part of 15 years as people have integrated into the high-performance servers that we develop today. As we look at those workloads, what we see that is that sometimes the drives get used as I am going to call them almost memory devices that the data is spread all over the place in the drive, but oftentimes, the systems level operating systems, the applications layers so on, have been able to aggregate into more sequential workloads. So, what the hybrid drive does is it allows the drive to shift from one to the other really well, and we foresee that there is not really any massive changes coming in server architecture or the operating systems architectures, that\u2019s going to address the drive. So, this is going to be a good value proposition for the high-performance drive for some time to come. And we think that most of the market will move over to these kinds of drives as people see that value performance of that (pay more).","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay. Just two last housekeeping, one on the TAM, can you just give us your sense of what you thought the TAM was in June? And then lastly, if you can make any comments on the appeals court process was announced yesterday?","Steve Luczo","Yeah, it seems like the TAM in June was 132, 133, Rich. And I will let Ken answer the question about the Court of Appeals.","Ken Massaroni","Yes, Rich. I mean, the company is pleased of the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the judgment back to the District Court with an order to enter the findings on our behalf that we did as indicators that will appeal to the Supreme Court Minnesota which has a discretionary appeal that Supreme Court is not compelled to take it. Seagate will do everything that we have to defend the judgment that we have received at this point in time, and we\u2019ll see what Supreme Court likes to do.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter.","Steve Luczo","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah representing Brean Capital. Please proceed.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Hi guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. A couple if I could. Hey, Steve, big acceleration, nice acceleration in the enterprise drives this quarter you referenced it as well. I was interested in saying if you give us some of the dynamics behind the 9% sequential increase and then also you are commenting on I guess if you think this is sort of the signal that some of the stronger growth (inaudible) that you mentioned on last quarter calls as well and then I\u2019ve a follow-up. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I think I\u2019ll let Rocky follow-up and what I mean generically it's continuous to be what we see as big build-out we call the infrastructure whether not that\u2019s CSG related or ISG related or even private (inaudible) related I mean clearly architecturally there is a big change going on in terms of how people are storing and managing their data. So I think it is a continuation of that trend, those growth rates you know tended to be accelerating and it is an extension of what I think happen over the course of the next several years. I think what\u2019s going to be interesting about the business is that it will be spiky I think from time to time I think more from upside perspective, I think that the general trend is positive and I think on top of that you\u2019re probably going to have these spikes for either big ISPs or CSPs decide that they have to do some big build out competitively or geographically and that\u2019s what we kind of manage our way through. You don\u2019t see that in the normal quarterly or maybe multi-quarterly planning process but then in quarter all of a sudden you can get these opportunities and the ability to respond to them is important. So I think it is the continued trend of overall architectural change that is certainly driving higher capacity drives in the infrastructure.","Rocky Pimentel","I will add to Steve\u2019s comments, there definitely was a strength of the quarter to quarter growth and what we call define as the cloud customer class, as Steve mentioned between each account the characteristic differ but the overall group continues to grow you know very robustly on a quarter-to-quarter basis and I think also this last quarter we filled in some of our product portfolio on the near line which gained a lot of momentum particularly in our 4 terabyte drive class category so couple of very positive drivers in the whole near line data center class products that\u2019s what we benefited from.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Yeah that\u2019s helpful and I then guess just part and parcel with that, growth margin guidance was flattish in the September quarter, can you just walkthrough I guess the puts and takes on the flash margin guidance kind of in the face of seeing improved mix as we begin the second half of the year. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Well actually in the second half of the year usually don\u2019t get improved mix, you get a strong notebook playing (ph) you get a smaller gaming play so actually the mix works against you the second half of the year and that\u2019s been in this case offset against you know we think continued growth on the cloud side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers representing Stifel. Please proceed.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","The first question looking at your 855 average capacity per drive as we look forward through this next fiscal year what do you think that exists this next fiscal year and then I think last quarter you had alluded the possibility of tightness on finished media if the industry were to get towards a 500 exabyte level or about 420 right now, what\u2019s your view on that updated view on that dynamic?","Dave Mosley","So we\u2019re not quite there yet I think it really does depend on the growth of the cloud specific Aaron to the extent that five disc drives are in the norm Rocky mentioned the 4 terabytes for example, as that continues to grow so I won't (inaudible) talk about box but just talk about Exabyte growth and then that really starts to strain the media. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be there in FY \u201914 but it will be more of a FY \u201915 commentary.","Steve Luczo","Now on the first question now I think if you look at the product offerings, the 4 GB product that we mentioned in kind of the demand we\u2019re seeing for that and then in the consumer marketplace which is really for the higher capacity drives are going obviously, there will a bunch of 2 GB products coming on so I think exiting the fiscal year will be certainly crusting our near 1 terabyte on average capacity per drive you know again you got to remember that the classic enterprise drives are lower capacity drives but they are doing much higher performance. So it's really what\u2019s going on in cloud and what\u2019s going on in consumer both those trends are quite neo-positive from a capacity perspective.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Great and then the final question for me, what assumption are you making as far as the TAM through the back half of this calendar year and how does that reflect the new game council cycle?","Steve Luczo","Well, we have only talked to September quarter, so I know we are not really talking close to the back half of the year. Again, we will give you a little better clarity about what we think some of the longer term trends are for the December quarter and to Rich\u2019s question earlier a little bit, our incentive up, two or three years out, but I think the market estimates are implied in our moderately sequential number. We are kind of thinking that it grew to 132 last quarter you can see 135 to 140 in the September quarter, and we would expect December to be up from that.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And game council?","Steve Luczo","In terms of what accident numbers or?","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, in terms of just the new game council cycle with the Xbox One and then the PS4?","Steve Luczo","Yes, it should be positive.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line (inaudible). Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Kate Scolnick","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Just following up on some of the comments around solid say drives developments that you had with Samsung, I was just curious in terms of where you think you would be on commercialization of some of those products between now and year end? And then secondly, any comments around some of that, there was couple of acquisitions that were relatively high profile in that area? And I was curious where you guys stand on build five versus build given those acquisitions and given your own incremental elements? Thanks.","Rocky Pimentel","Yes. So, I think based on the activities that, this is Rocky by the way, that we have done over the last year were still very interested in making strategic investments in SSD and PCI category products. Organically, we have been utilizing our Samsung partnership as well as our internal development efforts. And right now, based on our forecast as we would exit this year, our organic efforts in SSD would be greater than any of those companies that were recently acquired by in the open marketplace. So, I think we feel pretty positive about the evolution of our SSD initiatives.","Steve Luczo","Yes, I mean, obviously there was nothing secret about the acquisitions that occurred and it was our decision not to participate. We are confident in what we are doing internally right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just secondly just looking at the notebook market for the second half, can you may be talk about where you stand in terms of 5 millimeter drives design wins, how much momentum you think that can contribute to your business as the year progresses?","Steve Luczo","Sure. I don\u2019t know that I view 5-millimeter necessarily as a notebook drive. I think we view 7-millimeter as probably the right platform for thin and light notebooks. 5-millimeter probably is the more compelling drive for something even more mobile like a tablet. And we are happy with the engagement that we have on the 7-millimeter side as most OEMs are incorporating 7-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid into their next generation thin and light offerings. And we are pleased to-date with the engagement we have had on the 5-millimeter side going into tablet. So, we do think that high capacity, high performance, and much lower cost on a per gigabyte basis is compelling to mobile users. So, we will see how it plays out the rest of this fiscal year, but so far I would say we are encouraged by what we are seeing from the OEMs. Rocky, you want to add?","Rocky Pimentel","Yes, I was going to say this quarter we will be shipping a meaningful amount of 5-millimeter drives as we launch into our initial program. So, we are pretty positive. We have several major OEM commitments on the 5-millimeter that we will be pursuing as we exit the September quarter and then continue to build that volume in the December quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra representing Evercore. Please proceed.","Rob Cihra - Evercore","Hi, thanks very much. Two questions, I guess, because one on gross margin, it was actually solid in the quarter 28% even on a weak PC market. I am just wondering though if you look at your target range, what you think you need to see to get higher up that, I mean, is it simply better capacity utilization or there are more drivers to that? And I have a follow-up, if that\u2019s alright.","Pat O'Malley","This is Pat, Rob. Clearly, volume would be beneficial to us, I mean, but given the world that we are seeing is with the modern growth rates now, we\u2019re really managing on the price stability as much as we can because we need these margins continue to invest and also just mix. As Steve talked about with the cloud build out that\u2019s certainly been helpful to maintain it, but to drive to the middle of the range, you need either a greater mix or some volume because I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job on maintaining the economics on the drives being sold.","Rob Cihra - Evercore","Okay and then just in CapEx you obviously have been running lean and you said running is a sort of whatever operational levels, I know you gave the guide for fiscal \u201914 to stay in your target range. Do you feel like you're almost running too low, I mean you\u2019re running nicely conservative but it was fiscal \u201913 almost too low when you start looking at new technologies and that sort of thing? I mean is that a, is there a chance for higher up in that range as you again in fiscal \u201914 or do you think you can still sort (ph) around maintenance levels. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I think it depends on I think the answer to your question is no, I don\u2019t think it was too low. I think it was appropriate for the visibility that we have around demand and which is both again a technical transition issue on the client side offset by a technical transition on the enterprise side offset by very squishy macroeconomic conditions and not a lot of that has changed so we\u2019re going to run the capital pretty tight. If the trends continue where the client side shows little or no growth and cloud continues to grow. We do think we will hit capacity issues, which then you we will probably evidence themselves and shortages and a different margin structure at which point then we can consider what we do on the capital side but we\u2019re not going to lean into it other than maintaining what we need for technical advancements. Dave do you want to add?","Dave Mosley","No I think that\u2019s right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","I just wanted to get a little bit of detail on your thoughts on ASPs as we have head into the back half, I know Pat you said that you\u2019re managing to have good economic, I mean there is a good growth margins in the quarter but I think some of the OEMs had said they had seen HD pricing starting to come down. So can you give us some sense of your expectation for ASPs as we move into September?","Pat O'Malley","Our position has been in the last several quarters remaining relatively flat. Obviously there is, our view is we still want to drive the cost of storage down by delivering compelling products through technology and cost management, but our view on the price is going to be relatively stable and that\u2019s our plans for the rest of this calendar year.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","And you also talked about having I think the commentary was meaningful and also a 5 millimeter drives in September quarter, are you\u2019re going to start breaking out the hybrid and the SSD products in any time over the next couple of quarters because it seems like it's becoming a more important piece of your business.","Randy Olmstead","I think we will be able to give some level of guidance as that market develops for us, probably a little premature right now as Rocky said we\u2019re going through a lot of OEM qualifications, we\u2019re feeling fairly positive but once it starts taking traction that\u2019s probably a fair breakout for a period of time.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay great and then just my final question. I know you guys, anniversary anniversaried the Samsung acquisition in the beginning of the year or last year December. Have you had any progress in terms of integrating that business, I know couple of quarters ago you said you weren\u2019t really focused on that but just wanted to get an update. Thanks.","Pat O'Malley","We\u2019re still under MASCOM agreement which we\u2019re working very positively with the agency and so we don\u2019t view it as a huge challenge but we\u2019re operating these two entities on the interface of the customers vary independently still today.","Steve Luczo","Yeah I mean the R&D side and the ops side has been integrated for a while but it's just the customer facing activities that we\u2019re managing separately and we will continue to do so until we\u2019re released from those restrictions by MASCOM (ph).","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Smith representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley","Guys can you just run through some of the puts and takes in the free cash flow side and when do you expect to get back to levels that allow to meet your repurchase goals?","Pat O'Malley","So, maybe on the repurchase goals I don\u2019t know what you are referring to, but from our standpoint, Steve in his prepared comments talked about returning 70% of operating cash flow, which was our goal last year and we met it, and we are continuing try to target up to that this year as well and also as much as 90% cash flow. So, for fiscal 2013, we have never had a stated goal other than to continue to return large amount of the use of the cash flow to the shareholders.","Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley","Yes, I guess, and just referring to the $250 million target exiting 2014?","Pat O'Malley","Yes, okay, that\u2019s calendar 2014. So, that\u2019s still a target with us. Obviously, the share price does have an effect on it. So, we will manage the business and we will continue. In the meantime, the return significant amounts of capital cash flow to the shareholders. So, that\u2019s the fiscal \u201813 goal.","Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley","And then Pat, just on the free cash flow this quarter, I think there was a large other item, can you just run through what drove the lower free cash flow in the quarter?","Pat O'Malley","The redemption of the debt we issued $1 billion, but we also redeemed $700 million. So, we had $111 million of basically premium and charges to accelerate that redemption, but in the period, we are going to say of over $40 million a year, extend their debt maturities over two years and dropped overall portfolio by 130 basis points. So, that was a one-time charge of the whole restructuring of the debt profile.","Scott Smith - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski representing Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. It\u2019s Dan Garofalo on for Andy. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to focus on the enterprise, I know there has been a few questions, obviously another strong quarter, especially in the near line category. I guess, as you look at that category, it looks like 21% year-over-year unit growth in fiscal \u201813 given the increasing capacity that is getting shipped in cloud applications, how should we think about unit growth in that category. Is it fair to think that it could accelerate?","Steve Luczo","It is tended to have accelerated over the last two years. And I think the conditions that are causing that acceleration are still in their early stages. So, I think as Cloud continues to build out, we still expect growth in that area.","Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then I guess just one follow-up if I could focusing on the PC industry, in addition to talk about second half catalyst related to new product intros, there has also been talk of Microsoft gaining support for Windows XP next April, potentially being a catalyst for the PC industry. I just wonder how are you looking at that event, as well as any color you can provide on your view of the PC pipeline for the second half of the year. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Well, I don\u2019t think we have \u2013 I mean, we have our own perspective on, which is we are positive, we are more positive than the doomsday scenario of the PC is dead. As you know, we tend to \u2013 we still wise line about PC Plus, not post PC. And we believe that the PC has an important role to plating and computing environment for sure as do the mobile devices that connect to it and around it as does the cloud that everything on it is going to ultimately connect to. So, our view is positive on the client side in all of its forms. And I wouldn\u2019t want to specifically identify an action by Microsoft, but we think the long-term trends are still positive for the PC industry, but there is no reason for us to kind of plan to that right today. We just \u2013 we have the capacity and ability to address that marketplace that\u2019s in front of us. And as it stabilizes or recovers we will be in a position to I think have a good product offering to fit all the different segmentations that are occurring around how people use technology and make their lives better.","Dan Garofalo - Piper Jaffray","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg representing Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question is on enterprise SSD market, I mean, we are seeing strong adoption of enterprise SSD, and Seagate has also made investment in the field. So, could you may be talk about the impact of enterprise SSDs on the mission critical drive?","Rocky Pimentel","Clearly there is emerging evolution of what\u2019s the high performance layer in the data centers which is the, it's a blend between mission critical and enterprise SSD and I think it's important that we have both sides of that equation covered, certainly there is again ebbs and flows of the transition between somebody wanting mission critical elements of HDDs and their typology versus SSD. So, I think with the growing success of our enterprise SSD initiative we\u2019re less concerned about what does that mean for mission critical drives and what it means about our kind of high performance element of the enterprise overall.","So, certainly we see some customers migrating more to SSD enterprise class SSD solution but still the mission critical is an important element in the overall architecture so both elements are important and the fact that we\u2019re succeeding it both kind of gives us confidence that whatever the customer wants we can fulfill their need.","Steve Luczo","We like to garner our characterization and these are complementary technologies, I have heard that somewhere before.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","And then if I may just a follow-up on the same question. I mean we have seen the NAND companies moving in the enterprise SSD space and given more than 80% cost of the enterprise SSD is just raw flash so the question is how you think HDD industry and Seagate compete against with NAND vendors when given they are increasing the offering in this space too.","Steve Luczo","Obviously understanding the customers and integrating with the customers is a key point of how successful you\u2019re going to be and so pointing back you will see a variance in the enterprise space understanding customer workloads, is really important. I will say that the market itself is very complex and so at some places the SSDs are being used as storage devices and some places they are actually storage class memory or memory like devices. And difference (inaudible) that it might be hanging up of, it's a really complex space maybe with one brush (ph) and say you know 10k or 15k HDDs belong here and SSDs belong here especially given the plethora of applications and the servers this will be really completed.","Pat O'Malley","So I think the reality is that the workload and application aspects that we either favor SSD or HDDs are different and those that favor SSDs weren\u2019t really being served by HDDs it's actually opening up in an entirely new application set and the front end of that set has advantages to SSD if it's random and if it enables therefore the analysis of more and more data then we think that obviously supports the need for high availability data to run through that front end and so we actually think warrant store (ph) and things like that are becoming very important as well. So again the replacement aspect of IE, I use an SSD drive to replace a boot drive that\u2019s a three year old story that was about 1% of the mission critical drives that we sold. I think the reality is just like phones that aren\u2019t using disk drives or driving the creation and sharing content that\u2019s impacting the need for more HDD and the infrastructure, SSDs on the enterprise side are doing the same thing with basically big data analytics and we\u2019re one having products that will participate in that category directly, we do it with partners, we do it with our own products and it also benefits us on the HDD side or on the hybrid side to one of the earlier questions I think which Kugele asked about the nature of that customer which seems to be the big data customers that need an accelerator into the SSD.","So we think again this is just part of an overall architectural change that favors big data growth and big data needs to sit on that disk drive ultimately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine representing Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","I think, hate to look at market shares on a short term basis but any comments you can make on whether the strength in enterprise reflects any share gains during the quarter and conversely the softness and client reflects any share losses or anything you walked away from? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","We have tended not to chase prices much on the client side, which may have resulted in some share loss. I would say, on the enterprise side again, it\u2019s the ability to kind of execute in quarter. Those could either be architectural issues, where we have to be qualified at some OEM or with some particular CSP in someone else isn\u2019t or it could product related. We do feel good about it\u2019s probably more of a Q1 story than a Q4 story, but we do feel good about the positioning of our new 4 terabyte drive. But I think in general, I think any market share shifts in the 1% range is pretty much noise level at this point. And I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think the industry is kind of fairly stable in its market share right now, and I don\u2019t see any big shifts occurring there one way or the other.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Thanks, Steve. And then a quick follow-up on OpEx, we have crept over the percentage of sales for a few quarters now, maybe it\u2019s not surprising given all the new products you have introduced, but you got it flat again kind of what changes \u2013 what changes going forward that enables if you kind of keep at this current level, any\u2026.","Steve Luczo","Yes, I know, it\u2019s an important question. Yes, I know, it\u2019s an important question. I think with the gross margin change that we have seen over the last couple of years anywhere from 800 to 1000 basis points of additional gross margin, and of course, the company has been good about returning a big percentage of that to our shareholders, I also think given all the opportunities in storage both on the mobile and the cloud side that it\u2019s important for us to invest in some new technologies and products that are resulting from that change in marketplace and that\u2019s where we have been making some investments. And it has pushed the OpEx up marginally. It\u2019s obviously tied to our expectations of revenues and profits down the stream., Some of that is SSD related, some of that is core technology related to make sure that we can keep aerial density growing at the rates that we need to, some of it specifically to mobile and some of it is to cloud.","And again at the September meeting, we will continue to update you on whatever our views are about these investments and the particular markets and the technologies that we are deploying, but I do think it\u2019s important for the company to make those investments and position itself to generate revenue growth and margin growth down the stream from those investments. We watch it closely as you know. OpEx is something that we fight hard for every day, and it\u2019s one of the nice DNAs of Seagate. So, we are actively managing it, but I do think it\u2019s important for us to take some of that gross margin expansion and position our company for growth, because there is so much growth related to the storage that we would be remised not to.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Fair point, thanks.","Steve Luczo","Thank you.","Operator","You have time for one final question and that question comes from the line of Cindy Shaw representing DISCERN. Please proceed.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN","Thank you. Several questions. First, you talked at your Investor Meeting last year about going out after the cloud storage by trying to really go up the stack and go more directly, and there is talk about potentially getting higher margins and prices to that value-add. As you look at what you are getting in terms of cloud business now, is that what\u2019s happening or is it more of a classic near line drive?","Steve Luczo","No, it\u2019s a classic near line drive.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN","Is there still a thought that you can with some of these folks that are trying to use more commodity-like drives go up the stack and get those higher margins?","Steve Luczo","We think about it very differently. With OpenStack deployment, there is the opportunity for a desegregation of the software and services level that exist today and many companies are pursuing architectures that say how you take our devices and deploy it with OpenStack to achieve their storage goals. To do that, there are many changes that we may need to make at the device level that effectively move us up the stack, and yes, we have those discussions ongoing with a wide variety of technology providers.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN","And then it\u2019s thought as to when that might actually start to happen in the marketplace, so we are talking the quarters, years?","Steve Luczo","Quarters.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN","Okay. And then following up on a couple of the earlier questions, there was some discussion about potential for capacity constraints as demand and start to improve and the constraint being media. Do you feel like you have got a lot of capacity in another area such as (inaudible) and things like that or would you start to bump into other things pretty quickly after the media?","Rocky Pimentel","It really depends on how it comes out Cindy, if it's the cloud drives there honestly heads media rich, if their client devices which were not as Steve said earlier we\u2019re not really leaning into and those are more box cap related (ph) where we have to procure individual parts and test time and things like that, so there is a balancing act. I think right now we\u2019ve got enough capacity for what we see in FY \u201914 and we\u2019re going to be cautious with our CapEx.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN","Okay and then one final clarification, when you answered one of the error questions I wanted to see, it was talking about PC long term trends, you used the word stabilizing, recover. Is it your view that the year-over-year declines in PCs was been seen, in the last few quarters are somewhat temporary phenomenon and the PC units are going to actually start to grow or is that factored in potentially getting hard drives into tablets.","Steve Luczo","Yeah I think it's maybe closer to the second half, I think that we need to stop viewing the world as defining it as the technology that\u2019s 10 year\u2019s old. When someone says PC I don\u2019t know what they think about that giant desktop thing or the notebook, our technology market has continued to evolve over the 35 years I have been in it and what\u2019s happening with tablets is in my mind not any different than what happened when we went from mainframe to many decline servers to PC to now phones and it's a constant evolution of technology that\u2019s basically becoming more and more available to more and more people which allows more people to share and create and at the end of the day that\u2019s driving more stores. So yes we\u2019re positive on the future of client devices if client devices are things that go in individuals hands and they will take the form of something that I can carry in my pocket or something that I can carry in my briefcase or something that\u2019s in my home or something that\u2019s in my workplace that is all connected and some of it may also be in a shared services that many people connect to. So I think we need to kind of change our thinking about what\u2019s happening to the PC, the PC is evolving just like it has for the last 30 years and continue to evolve.","Okay. I think that\u2019s last question. Again we want to thank everybody for your time this morning and for coming in for our early call and we look forward to seeing you in September and then talking to you on the next call.

My name is Josh, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Shanye Hudson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Shanye.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me are Dave Mosley, Seagate's Chief Executive Officer; and Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our December 2019 quarter on the Investors section of our website.","During today's call, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and\/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.","As a reminder, this call contains forward-looking statements, including our March quarter financial outlook and expectations about our financial performance, market demand, industry growth trends, planned product introductions, ability to ramp production, future growth opportunities and general market conditions. These statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.","Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental information posted on the Investors section of our website. Following today's prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to you Dave.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Shanye. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I will begin today's call by highlighting a few key accomplishments for the December quarter and then I will share some perspectives on the market trends and their relevance to Seagate. Afterwards, I will turn the call over to Gianluca to elaborate on our December quarter financial performance and present our March quarter outlook. Following the prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. ","In the December quarter we grew revenue to $2.7 billion and drove strong double-digit profit growth on a sequential basis with both non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS coming in at the upper end of our guided ranges. Importantly, we have generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months underscoring our consistent operational execution. In addition to delivering solid financial results, we achieved record exabyte shipments in the December quarter supported by strong demand for mass capacity storage and the continued successful ramp of our 16-terabyte products. ","Consistent with our expectations, we shipped 1 million 16-terabyte drives during the quarter to support strong customer demand. We also strengthened our product portfolio announcing Seagate Lyve Drive Mobile System, a series of seamlessly integrated storage solutions to address the burgeoning need to move data between endpoints, edge and core cloud environments in an efficient, secure and cost effective way. Lyve Drive was one of many products we showcased during the Consumer Electronics Show this past January, which I'll discuss shortly.","First, let me comment on some of the trends we're seeing in the market. Our December quarter results highlight the increasing demand for mass capacity storage, which includes nearline, video and image applications and network-attached storage or NAS. Revenue from mass capacity storage increased 9% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year, driven by growth across each of these markets. This positive trajectory reflects both ongoing demand recovery as well as secular growth for mass capacity storage. ","In nearline, we are leading the industry's transition to 16-terabytes, which is the largest capacity drive available in mass volume today, offering the best total cost of ownership opportunity for our customers. In the December quarter, these products represented the highest revenue and highest exabyte shipments of any of our drives. We achieved these results while still at the very early stages of this industry transition. Nearline demand has been on a positive trajectory that we expect will continue through at least the rest of the fiscal year. We are well positioned to address this growing demand as we continue to ramp our 16-terabyte production and launch our 18-terabyte drives, which are based on the same platform, simplifying the manufacturing and qualification processes. ","The 18-terabyte launch is progressing to plan and we remain on track to begin shipments in the first half of the calendar year 2020. We expect to align our production to meet customers' demand.","In video and image applications, we achieved record revenue in the December quarter, driven by strong demand for surveillance drives. As we've shared for multiple quarters now, global uncertainty has created some disruption in typical customer buying patterns within certain markets, including surveillance. However, the underlying demand drivers remain intact and inventory levels appear to be relatively healthy, supporting our positive view of demand over the long-term. Security surveillance is just one of a growing number of applications adopting high-definition video and image processing, which require mass capacity storage at the edge and in the cloud. Two weeks ago at CES, we demonstrated how video and imaging sensors are being deployed in smart cities and smart factories to collect and analyze massive amounts of data used to improve traffic flow, hastened emergency response times, lower production costs and improve worker safety. These are real world use cases spawned by the emergence of IT 4.0, which illustrate how organizations are unlocking value from the data being created by sensors, cameras, and other endpoint devices.","The transition to IT 4.0 and trend towards a multi-cloud world create meaningful opportunities for Seagate. We project that typical smart factory can create 5-petabytes of video data per day and the smart city could generate 200-petabytes each day. The fully realized data potential, compute and storage must be moved closer to the source of creation, closer to the edge. At CES, we also showcased how Seagate's storage solutions are enabling IT 4.0 and hybrid cloud environments by leveraging our innovative technologies and expertise in systems\u2019 architectures. We featured our high density scalable solutions, which offer enterprise customers a cost-effective petabyte solution, ideal for data-rich cloud applications. The unit we displayed at CES was configured with 106 HDDs, including multiple HAMR drives working in real time. We are on track to release the industry's first commercially available HAMR drive in late calendar 2020 at the 20-terabyte capacity point. ","Each year, I look forward to the Consumer Electronics Show for the opportunity to interact directly with customers, partners, suppliers, and loyal enthusiasts of Seagate products and hear their feedback firsthand. The consumer market remains a very good business for Seagate. In fact, in the December quarter alone, we shipped 12 exabytes in portable external drives trusted by our user community to move their data. The media and the entertainment professionals, gamers and prosumers of the Seagate branded storage solutions represents quality, reliability and simplicity. ","We designed our Lyve Drive Mobile Solutions with these same principles in mind. As I mentioned earlier, Lyve Drive offers enterprise CIOs a solution for efficiently and cost effectively managing data between endpoints, edge and core cloud. Even with a dedicated 10-gigabit per second connection, it would take at least 12 days to upload 1 petabyte of data to the cloud. The cost for sending large amounts of data over a network can be in order of magnitude more expensive than simply physically transporting it. With Lyve Drive, customers can securely transfer data and ingest it into their data centers more quickly and affordably than other available options. Our integrated approach is a first key step towards a unified data experience. ","Overall, we're excited by the momentum of our 16-terabyte drives, the competitive strength of our technology roadmap and the breadth of our product portfolio, all of which we believe position Seagate to address well the growing demand for mass capacity storage and the need for data management solutions. ","With that. I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our December quarter results and share our outlook for the March quarter. ","Gianluca Romano","Thank you, Dave. The December quarter represented another period of solid financial performance and strong free cash flow. On a sequential basis revenue increased 5% to $2.7 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased 29% translating to non-GAAP operating margin of nearly 16% of revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share increased [31%] to $1.35. Our results demonstrate strong operating leverage supported by ongoing expense discipline and a richer revenue mix of mass capacity storage. Mass capacity storage which include nearline, video and image application and NAS drives represented 49% of total December quarter revenue, up from 47% in the prior quarter and 39% in the prior year. ","Exabyte shipment into this market increased 12% sequentially to 71 exabytes. This strong sequential growth was underpinned by demand for our mass capacity drives. As we shared during our analyst event we expect that mass capacity revenue will continue to grow quickly over the next several years. Our product portfolio and technology roadmap are well aligned to capture these growth opportunities. Revenue from 16-terabyte drives nearly tripled quarter-over-quarter making them our highest revenue product during the quarter, a trend we expect to persist through the rest of the fiscal year as we continue to ramp this product to support the broadening of customer demand. ","Increased demand for mid capacity nearline drives was another highlight for the quarter. Sales of our 4, 6 and 8-terabyte drives moved higher to support enterprise and OEM customers as they build out to their own prem and private cloud storage needs. Our cost reduced mid capacity product continued to gain momentum offering customers a better TCO relative to prior generation products. In addition to LTE nearline demand, we also realized double-digit revenue and exabyte growth for video and image applications reflecting above seasonal demand which we expect to normalize moving into the second half of the fiscal year. ","As Dave shared earlier with the advent of IT 4.0 and the adoption of video and image sensor across a growing number of applications, we thought it would be meaningful growth opportunity as for our mass capacity storage solutions in this market. ","Revenue from the legacy market remained fairly flat on a sequential basis and represented 43% of December quarter revenue, compared with 46% in the September quarter.","Exabyte shipment into the legacy market increased 3% sequentially to 36 exabytes. We continue to garner customer and consumer support for our legacy product, which include mission-critical, desktop, notebook, DVR and external consumer device. Seasonal demand for consumer drive combined with higher mission-critical sales largely offset the expected decline in gaming consoles and notebooks. Overall, our total HDD average capacity per drive increased 11% sequentially and we expect average drive capacity to further increase as demand for mass capacity storage continue to grow. ","The remaining 8% of December quarter revenue was derived from our non-HDD business, in which revenue increased 14% sequentially, driven by growth in both system and SSD. We're continuing to gain momentum with our system solutions driven by increasing demand for data at the edge, and adoption of private cloud. Enterprise customers are seeking the denser storage solution driving higher system content. This dynamic supported a new exabyte shipment record for system in the December quarter.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 28.7%, up 200 basis points sequentially, reflecting a more favorable product mix with a higher contribution from mass capacity drives. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $350 million, down 3% sequentially and slightly below our prior estimate, due mainly to lower discretionary spending. We are evaluating opportunities to drive further operational efficiencies while continuing to invest in areas that support future growth. With a combination of higher gross margin and controlled spending, we delivered non-GAAP operating income of $424 million, up to 29% quarter-over-quarter. This translates to non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16% of revenue at the top end of our long-term financial model range. ","Based on a share count of approximately 265 million shares, non-GAAP EPS for the December quarter was $1.35, which surpassed our guidance midpoint. Consistent with our expectation, capital expenditure increased to $194 million to support growing demand for mass capacity storage.","We project fiscal year CapEx to be towards the middle of our long-term range of 6% to 8% of revenue. We generated strong free cash flow in the December quarter, fairly stable with the past several quarters and we continue to deploy capital to reward shareholders through our longstanding capital return program. We utilized $150 million to retire 2.5 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 261 million shares outstanding and we used $165 million to fund our dividend. Our Board also approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.65 per share payable on April 8, 2020. As of the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were at $1.7 billion and we have access to an additional $1.5 billion through our revolver. Gross debt was $4.1 billion with a net debt of $2.4 billion, both fairly flat with the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 23% sequentially to approximately $500 million and we expect our gross debt leverage ratio to be at or below 2 times within the next few quarters. ","Looking ahead to our outlook for the March quarter. As the Coronavirus outbreak continues, we have made our first priority the health and wellbeing of our employees and partners. We are also working with our suppliers to meet customer demand and mitigate risk to production. While we currently do not expect any material financial impact in the March quarter there still a lot of uncertainty and therefore we are widening our revenue and EPS guidance ranges. With this in mind, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.7 billion plus or minus 7%. ","At the midpoint of our revenue guidance we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be at the high end of our long-term target range of 13% to 16% of revenue. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to $1.35 plus or minus 7%. In general, we're seeing a change in typical seasonality as HDD demand shift away from consumer-oriented legacy markets and towards mass capacity storage driven by data growth in the cloud and at the edge. The demand environment has continued to steadily improve particularly for high capacity nearline drives. With the positive customer momentum we have established for our 16-terabyte byproducts we continue to expect both revenue and profitability to grow in fiscal 2020 with the second half revenue slightly higher than the first half for this fiscal year. ","I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments. ","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Gianluca. In summary, our performance demonstrates our ability to deliver solid financial results and drive cash generation throughout industry cycles. We are continuing to identify ways to drive further operational efficiencies to optimize profitability. We are also leveraging our strong technology roadmap, broad product portfolio, deep customer relationships and systems architecture expertise to address secular demand for mass capacity storage and emerging opportunities to provide cost effective data management solutions. I\u2019m confident that Seagate is well positioned to fully capitalize on these growth opportunities while enhancing value for our customers and shareholders. ","Before opening the call for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their contributions to the ongoing success of our business. Josh I\u2019ll hand it back to you to lead through the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Jeff on for Sidney. Gross margins were good in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about any pricing pressure that you were seeing related to high capacity drives? ","Dave Mosley","I think I would say that the market for a on a dollars per terabyte basis, if I look back over the last couple of years -- hi Jeff by the way, I would say that it\u2019s reflecting a pretty competitive space, and I expect that over the long haul, we're all going to have to make investments to answer the call in that growth space. So I think at some point we have to continue to work our costs down, which we're doing. We have to work through product transitions which we are doing but we'll also have to install capital, and I expect at some point we're going to have to focus more on -- rather than chasing share, we're going to have to focus more on making those investments.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned increased demand for midline capacity drives as enterprise and OEMs build out their own storage needs. Can you talk a little more about this opportunity and does this potentially lead to a less reliance on the cloud service providers in the future?","Dave Mosley","No. I would say, if I go back a year and a half to the peak of the last cycle, thereabout, the market was very strong across the portfolio. I think the highest capacity points typically go to the bigger customers, but I think there are many small customers globally, which are still not as fully representative as they were in the peak of the last cycle, frankly, but are taking all kinds of different capacity points. And so, therefore it's important to have a broad product portfolio and address them with the right products.","Operator","Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you just talk about how you see 16-terabyte ramping? In which quarter do you expect the biggest sequential ramp in volume? And then, is there any reason that as 16-terabyte volumes ramp the gross margins wouldn't improve in a fairly linear fashion?","Dave Mosley","I think we can both take it Katy, I'll pass it over to Gianluca for the gross margin part. We've said that this is one of the biggest ramps we've ever done, if not the biggest ramp we've ever done at heads and media. We're in the middle of it and to the point of just saying this quarter we will do 1 million and then having done 1 million, that's indicative of the strength of that ramp. The ramp is not over. It's going to keep going. And the way we look at it is, there\u2019s were many products in our portfolio before, but this platform is the one that's going to take us from 16 to 18 to 20 and beyond. Our ability to leverage costs and the other technology pieces that we have to put in there, is great now that we don't have to keep transitioning products, we get a lot of leverage from that. We talked about that in the prepared remarks. So from my perspective, we have that strong portfolio to take us forward. I think Gianluca can speak about gross margins.","Gianluca Romano","Yes. I'd say in fiscal Q2, the improvement in gross margin is coming partially from the 16-terabyte, but as we said, actually tripled the volume during the quarter but also from an overall cost reduction on several other drives. So, looking at Q3, we will have for sure an higher volume in 16-terabytes that will help our gross margin, but of course depends on the overall mix of the entire volume that we move into the quarter.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. And if I can just follow up, Dave, going back to your comments about the difficulty of ramping heads in media that you executed on for 16-terabytes. There -- if you take demand side there have been some questions around whether the qualifications are coming in. Can you just talk about kind of U.S. versus China and any general numbers around how many of your big customers have qualified and are actually purchasing that product at this point?","Dave Mosley","We're fairly happy with the breadth of the qualification. I mean, if you get down to very specific customers, they may be ready to take 16. Some of them may be back on 8 for example. Globally, there's people that -- for various reasons, they aren't ready to move there in the architecture, and we get that. In general, we're on plan with our ramp and I think our ramp is going to continue from here. The qualifications are going quite well. So I'm not worried about it at all. I think that as I look across the customer base, Katy, what we've talked about in the past was everybody adopting the highest capacity point quickly. I think that's happening less and less, frankly, because I think there's a lot of -- as we've talked in the past, there's a lot of diverse need even within one customer set, even with one customer. And then each customer may have their own different specific needs. So I think as the cloud grows bigger, certainly some of the scale people have diversity needs so that they have to make sure that we continue to service. It's not just about the build out of the new stuff and it's a growing world. So, we have to work with all those customers to get them exactly what they need and 16 is doing quite well against that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Ananda Baruah","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple from me if I could, just sticking on gross margin. I may have missed it, but did you make remarks about what we should expect for gross margin in the March quarter? And then just as a follow-up to that, philosophically, as you can see to improve the yields on 16 and Dave to your point about the platform transition to 18, same platform, why wouldn't the gross margin level up nicely once you get the 16 yields to normalize and then as you transition on to 18 from there, once you have the cost, so the cost situation, yield situation handled?","Dave Mosley","Well, I think as the portfolio -- as the market continues to grow, so the supply and demand is probably the first driver of all those discussions. So if -- the supply demand picture continues to grow in the favor of more demand and not as much supply, I think, we can start asking those questions. So that that gives them the cloud cyclicality. And I'll let Gianluca specifically say about how he thinks about gross margin. ","Gianluca Romano","Hi Ananda. You know we don't really guide gross margin, but if you look at our revenue and our EPS are fairly were aligned quarter-over-quarter. So I'll have to take your assumption but no, I would not see a major change sequentially. ","Dave Mosley","I think if we see a big demand in the 16-terabyte, the 18-terabyte, once we get there is in high demand, I think we should be able to manage it. I think we talked about that a little bit last quarter as well. And what you described may happen, but I think the broader portfolio from our perspective, and we've said this before, we're really managing for things closer to the bottom-line like operating income and now that we're at the top end of our range again, we\u2019re quite happy with that. ","Ananda Baruah","Great. Then you mentioned positive trajectory for hyperscale from here, you expect June to be up for March as well. I mean I know things can change but just in your base case from an exabyte perspective?","Dave Mosley","Yes. We\u2019ve talked to the end of the fiscal year that I don't see any reason for the cycle to slow down by the end of the fiscal year. Out the back end of the calendar year, we're not really ready to talk about that yet given all the disruptions that are going on in the market. But I will say this, I'm very happy with our product portfolio going into this next cycle whenever it comes. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Aaron Rakers","Thanks for taking the question. I'll try and get two in here as well. Just on that final comment on the product cycle set up, I know that you mentioned during the call that you have 18 TB shipping in the first half of the year. Just -- sorry about the nuance here. But when you say that, do you mean that you expect to see shipments in volume in the first half of the calendar year or is that just shipments in the qualification? I'm just trying to understand the timing of those relative to your competitor.","Dave Mosley","Well, yes, I don't really want to get into that too much here, but I would say that, in my opinion qualification is volume. I mean it's not one. The qualification test beds if you will, are fairly big volume. And so, it's not 1 million per quarter, like we just talked about, a few quarters into the ramp up of the 16. But, yes, that kind of goes hand in glove.","Aaron Rakers","Okay, fair enough. And then, as we think about the trajectory of the business, I'm just curious now that you're breaking it out a little bit differently between mass capacity versus legacy, as we model going forward, we talk a lot about nearline, but I'm curious of how you think about the rate of decline in the legacy business as we move out over the next couple of quarters or if you want to take a stab longer-term?","Dave Mosley","Very interesting. If I think about some of the legacy businesses, the way we're thinking about them is we're not really investing much OpEx into them anymore, but we have a very broad customer portfolio that actually needs those products to go make whatever pivot they're going to make from the old world client server IT 2.0 to the new world 4.0, right? We have to continue to support those customers and foster those relationships with what they need. In some cases, we see surprise downsides, in other cases we see surprise upsides based on how they're driving their markets and we react to them. I would say, across most of the legacy space, there's a mix up going on. So even if the units are coming down, the mix is going up, the use cases are still relevant in the cases of some, there are already -- as you know, there are hundreds of millions of slots for these form factors out in the world, and just the support business for that is a long tail, and that's the way I think about it. Probably as it mixes up it becomes more stable relatively. So it's not going away very soon, but we're not investing in it either. We're just continuing to service it predictably.","Gianluca Romano","Yes. I think it\u2019s raising a very good point. You should look at the importance of the legacy business in terms of free cash flow, considering where the OpEx and the CapEx is fairly low in that area. It's still a good contributor to our free cash flow in general. So, it\u2019s still very important to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Hi. Good afternoon. I hope this question wasn't answered. Got disconnected a couple of times. But in terms of looking at the competitive environment, your largest competitor has talked about maybe regaining some market share down the road this year as they launch 16 TB products and above, suggesting that maybe you're overperforming on market share right now, but at the same time you're talking about ramping more of 16-terabyte volume and 18 TB is ramping. So, I guess without throwing too many stones, I\u2019m just curious what you would say about just your relative market share potential for the rest of the year?","Dave Mosley","Yes, I would say market share is not exactly an outcome. We need a -- as an outcome that\u2019s not exactly our objective. So we made a conscious decision, if you remember Steven three quarters, four quarters ago, sort of pivoting from some of the lower capacity points into the 16 platform and we were very open about that, just because we knew we would get the leverage into the 18s and 20s like we've talked about. I think as some of that happens, customers will drive us for more and more of that demand. And I think some of the puts and takes you've seen in share may change a little bit. But again, we're trying to be predictable for those customers to get them exactly what they need. I like our plans because we happen to have the drive up the ramp-up already. So it's very predictable. ","Steven Fox ","Okay. That's helpful. Just on a couple of follow-ups. First on what you just said about pivoting away from lower capacity points, I guess I was under the impression that a lot of that was in the rearview mirror. But you're saying you still may do more of that as we look out over the next 12 months to 18 months, and then I had a quick follow-up? ","Dave Mosley ","No, sorry. Well, there are still our customers that need those products for various reasons, right, because of their architectures or what have you. But no, what I said in particular is if I go back nine months, we were very vocal about we're moving to 16s to these new platforms. And we've been focusing all of our operational resources and heads and media and things like that on those new platforms. ","Steven Fox ","Okay. I understand now. And then in terms of gross margins, I understand you don't want to guide the gross margins. But you've mentioned several -- without getting into detail, you've mentioned several drivers that would seem to improve your gross margins considerably over the next few quarters or at least a little bit, what are the drags that we should worry about outside of macro that could be pressure on the gross margins? ","Dave Mosley ","I'll let Gianluca answer, but you're hitting the right theme, which it comes down to supply and demand. So for specific products or for the cloud cyclicality, as we've talked about before, if we've got supply and demand pretty well balanced, we should be able to manage exactly like you described, but go ahead, Gianluca. ","Gianluca Romano ","Well, I would say that we expect high volume from our 16 terabyte and the mass capacity storage drives in general. We think our cost is declining fairly well. Of course, when you talk about gross margin, the other variable is pricing and now we will have to wait and see how the pricing will be during the quarter and that will determine our gross margin at the end. ","Dave Mosley ","I think we've said before that -- especially in the down cycle like we were in early calendar '19 that we're managing for free cash flow and operating income is the way we're focused. As the cloud comes back to a more of a peak cycle, then we can figure out exactly how we're going to balance our portfolio. But it starts with what the customers need and making sure we get them what they need to go achieve their business objectives and we're always mindful of the demand cyclicality as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Suva, Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Jim Suva ","Thank you very much. If I understand it correctly, your 18-platform is going to be on the same platform as 16. And if so, when we think about that, I would assume that means that there is lower yield issues, lower risk and things like that or is there additional complexity you should be aware of? And when we think about once it's ramping and more volume, would the profitability be similar or why wouldn't it actually be higher, just kind of talking kind of longer term? ","Dave Mosley ","So, in theory, you're right. I would say, if we look back over multiple generations in the industry, all the way back to 2-terabytes or 3-terabytes, we were changing platforms quite frequently, more heads and media, more different technologies being brought to bear and things like that. It's a new mechanical platform, so a lot of parts we're changing. Exactly to your point, we've been talking about this with the 16. We think it's a highly leverageable platform for many years. There will be subtle changes, but I think that most of the parts are not changing and that helps our ability to ramp, our ability to yield and our ability to scale for the customers, be more flexible actually if we can move most of our product portfolio over there. So it does provide opportunities, but again, supply and demand is the key driver there. Gianluca, do you have something to add there? ","Gianluca Romano ","No, I think you made the point. ","Dave Mosley ","Okay. Does that make sense, Jim? ","Jim Suva ","It does. Lastly, anything on tax rate we should be aware of for kind of longer term modeling for tax rate? ","Gianluca Romano ","No, I don't expect any change in our tax rate. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Patrick Ho ","Thank you very much. Dave, maybe first off, in terms of the transition from 16-terabytes to 18-terabytes, you mentioned some of the ease for customers. How do we look at it from a new customer or share win standpoint, given that the transition to existing customers probably is easy. But how do you look at it from a new customer win standpoint? Does the success of 16-terabyte help validate it for the new customers? ","Dave Mosley ","In some cases, because of the leverage, especially on firmware basis and things like that, the feature sets, things like that. But no, in general, most customers are going to every new qualification with a discerning eye. They want to make sure that they do all the things right to integrate it into their data center. And again, it's -- data centers are not one size fits all, there is many different applications, some of the big customers have so many different applications, they have to worry about being able to plug this into legacy architectures or new architectures or things like that and globally there's many different BIOSes being used, chipsets being used so on and you get it. So there is some leverage for sure, people know the family now, they're already comfortable with the family. There is some leverage, and then there is some element of a new customer, you have to go through the same amount of work. ","Patrick Ho ","Great. And maybe as my follow-up question to Gianluca. In terms of the gross margin, you've given a lot of color on the call so far. In terms of the cost reduction impact versus the change in product mix, on a going forward basis, is it more of a mix issue at where you could say that the cost reductions are already in place and it's now just the mix turning more favorable? ","Gianluca Romano ","Yes. Probably, the mix is a major driver in the cost reduction at this point. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Munjal Shah ","I had two. One on, could you comment on the surveillance demand. Is there anything going on with the large customers you think that there is all in or any thoughts for trend in the quarter? And then I have another one for Gianluca. Your comments suggest that gross margin should improve sequentially and your EPS guidance is flat sequentially. I was just wondering if there is anything that's an offset in here? ","Dave Mosley ","Yes, I think relative to surveillance, we have over the years seen some, I'll call it, seasonality around government buying cycles at the end of the calendar year. And as the market moves towards some smart city applications, especially globally, I think there are markets that we're seeing now that people are investing quite a bit for smart cities. You do see that cyclicality. The market is growing. I would argue that from a units\u2019 perspective, it's probably, there have been peaks that are bigger than the one we're in from an exabyte perspective, obviously we are in a growth period, in this one with a record exabytes. So the way I look at it every year gets a little bit stronger, but there is still some seasonality cyclicality. ","Shanye Hudson ","And then, Munjal, just to clarify on your second question, I got the second part, you were saying guidance on the EPS side is flat. Could you repeat the first part of your question? ","Munjal Shah ","Right, and then the comments suggest that -- I mean, comments generally suggest that gross margin should improve because your 16-terabyte mix will probably be higher in March. So is there an offset below the gross margin line? ","Gianluca Romano ","No, as I said before, we have an assumption on pricing of course, and can be different and when we go through the quarter. But with a fairly flat revenue, we expect a fairly flat EPS quarter-over-quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Nehal Chokshi ","Recognizing that you're still in the growth mode on the hyperscale demand on nearline growth. That being said, the exabytes currently relative to the last peak is up only 10% versus prior peaks -- peak-to-peak it's around 2x. And with the potential that you're going to be hitting a digestion phase going into calendar 2H '20, I was wondering if you had some thoughts on why not as much potential peak-to-peak growth as in prior peaks, any thoughts there? ","Dave Mosley ","Yes. It's quite interesting. I didn't say that we were in a digestion phase then, but I think we've seen that cyclicality before. It's dangerous to say that will happen exactly again, because there has been a different reason for the cyclicality every time it hits. That said, I do think that the demand is growing. I think that the customers are broadening. And I also think that their ability to use higher and higher capacity points is actually getting bigger. So once upon a time, people couldn't use more than 4-terabytes and while most of the market was on 8s and you're starting to see people get shifting over to bigger capacity points as well. So I do think exabyte growth is still going to continue. I don't think I'm calling the top of the peak at 10% yet. ","Operator","Your last question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Karl Ackerman ","I wanted to maybe shift gears a little bit and talk about something that hasn't been asked yet. But just on the systems business that was up 14% sequentially, pretty good performance. I'm guessing that segment also performed well from systems revenue, selling your high capacity offerings. But maybe you could just discuss some of the traction you're seeing in SSDs and kind of what you're seeing for that broad segment, how we should think about that in the March quarter? ","Dave Mosley ","Yes. I would say on this from a systems perspective, we're happy with what we've done with the portfolio, which is, we're not making boxes that don't have any Seagate products in them anymore. Now we're making boxes full of -- chalk full of Seagate products right, with lots of drives, 100 drives or plus in some of the boxes. And that's a great vehicle to go move higher capacity drives into the market quickly. So I'm happy with the pivot the team has made. I think there's some opportunity to go grow it as well. ","On the SSD side, I think customers are very happy with our products, we continue to service those customers and I think as -- I'm not the first one to be saying this, the market seems to be stabilizing vis-\u00e0-vis what it was a year ago. So we'll continue to service those customers in a meaningful way I think. ","Karl Ackerman ","Just maybe one last one if I may. CapEx did spike up a little bit this quarter. When we think about the forward trajectory, are you adding capacity for 16 and 18-terabyte that speaks to what's to come in the back half of the calendar year, or are you suggesting a breadth of SKUs is needed as enterprise customers\u2019 capacity needs are bifurcating between high and mid range SKUs? Thanks. ","Dave Mosley ","Actually interesting. I think the first one and it's not just that it's also the transition that we have to make to HAMR. We think that long lead time capital is the important stuff, the heads and media to get it online for the growth that we see in the cloud, and we're investing for it. So we are confident in our 16, 18, 20-terabyte ramps, same platform like we've been talking about. We need to make the heads and media investments to make sure that we have enough in the market when the demand is out there. ","Gianluca Romano ","Yes. Let me add that we are still focusing on keeping the CapEx in the range that we gave at the Analyst Day, so between 6% and 8% of our revenue. We don't expect to go above this range in any quarter. ","Operator","There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to management for closing remarks. ","Dave Mosley","Okay. Thanks, Josh. To summarize, we're continuing to manage the business well optimizing profitability and generating cash to fund our future growth and deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. And the world is just creating data at a breakneck pace, which in turn drives secular growth for mass capacity storage and needs for cost-effective data management solutions and I believe in our technology roadmap, our product portfolio. I think Seagate is very well positioned to capitalize on all these trends. So I'd like to once again thank all our customers, suppliers, business partners, employees for their contributions to our performance and also like to thank the shareholders for their ongoing support.

Please proceed, Shanye.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s call. Joining me today are Dave Mosley, Seagate\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our June 2019 quarter on the Investors section of our website.","During today\u2019s call, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. And we\u2019ll start off by summarizing key highlights from the June quarter and sharing some perspectives on the market before outlining our progress on our key priorities. Afterwards, Gianluca will discuss details on our June quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the September quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.","Seagate continues to deliver on its financial commitments, achieving June quarter results that were solidly in line with our expectations. We recorded revenue of $2.37 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, both toward the upper end of our guidance range against the backdrop of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory hurdles. These broader macro conditions disrupted our customers\u2019 buying patterns, causing trepidation amongst some of our enterprise and OEM partners, while prompting others to accelerate demand, including a few surveillance customers.","Our ability to adapt to market volatility and intelligently manage our business enabled us to increase revenue and exabyte shipments quarter-over-quarter, supported by improving demand for our nearline drives from cloud and hyperscale customers. Additionally, our fiscal year performance demonstrates solid execution on our priorities to optimize profitability and free cash flow.","We have been successfully pivoting the business towards growing markets, which include enterprise nearline drives, edge stores for surveillance and NAS, and our cloud system solutions. In fiscal 2019, we delivered annual revenue of $10.4 billion, of which approximately half was derived from these markets. These applications require reliable, cost-effective mass storage, making them well suited to our portfolio products. Importantly, they contributed an even higher percentage of our gross profit, providing a solid platform for margins to expand as they become a greater part of our overall revenue.","At the same time, we are continuing to supply HDDs into mature markets, which include mission-critical, edge compute, DVR, gaming and consumer applications to support our customers\u2019 needs. These products require minimal further investment while contributing nicely to our overall operating income.","We are continuing to tightly manage expenses, while prioritizing investments towards areas that deliver the greatest value to our customers and strong returns for Seagate. In fiscal year 2019, we reduced our full year non-GAAP operating expenses by 9%, while increasing our investments in next generation technologies to improve areal density and lower cost per terabyte.","We\u2019re leveraging our significant free cash flow generation to enhance shareholder value. In fiscal 2019, we delivered $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long standing commitment to capital returns as well as our confidence in sustainable cash flow generation. We continue to advance our technology roadmap and focus on being first to market with new product solutions. This strategy enables us to provide our customers with cost and performance benefits and an attractive margin for Seagate.","As we shared last quarter, we began shipping our 16 terabyte drives in late March to deliver the world\u2019s highest capacity storage solutions and we have already introduced products for both enterprise and edge storage applications. Customer qualifications are progressing well and we remain on track to ramp high volume shipments leader in calendar year 2019.","In addition to driving the next generation of high-capacity storage, we are the first to introduce dual-actuator technology. This technology effectively doubles the performance at the same capacity points, making it ideal for cloud workloads and edge sequential operations servicing large data flows such as video streaming, smart factories, AI and machine learning. Our MACH.2 dual-actuator technology is garnering strong interest.","Customers have started to qualify these drives, which we expect to begin shipping later this calendar year and becoming increasingly critical across the industry starting around the 20 terabyte capacity point.","Looking ahead, we expect to capture another industry first with the introduction of 20 terabyte capacity drives, which will be based on our highly scalable HAMR technology. Six years ago I stated that HDDs would be 20 terabytes by the end of calendar 2020 and we remain on track to hit that target. We are focused on making the transition to HAMR technology seamless for our customers. Our HAMR drives are built on a common platform to current 16 terabyte drives, which is helping to accelerate maturity and adoption in the market.","As we enter fiscal year 2020, we expect the macro-related uncertainties that I described earlier, will continue to have some influence on near-term industry dynamics. However, we expect demand from global cloud and hyperscale customers will continue to improve, particularly for high-capacity drives. Seagate is well positioned to address this growing demand with a strong technology portfolio, deep customer relationships, manufacturing expertise and precision robotics, assembly and analytics, and the supply chain flexibility, which together all enable manufacturing cost advantages.","We expect our exabytes shipments into the enterprise nearline market will be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40% in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, we expect to deliver healthy revenue growth year-over-year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the Gianluca to go into more depth on our June quarter results and share our outlook for the September quarter.","Gianluca Romano","Thank you, Dave. I\u2019m going to focus on driving strong operational efficiency and effectively managing the business through dynamic market conditions. On a sequential basis, we grew June quarter revenue by 3% to $2.37 billion, and above the midpoint of our guidance range.","We increased total exabyte shipments by 10% to 84.5 exabytes and we expended non-GAAP operating income by 8% to $286 million. While the geopolitical situation will remain uncertain, we are seeing improving demand condition particularly among cloud and hyperscale customers for higher capacity nearline drives.","Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives, represented 41% of total June quarter revenue, up from 39% in the March quarter, mainly due to stronger demand in nearline drives. Exabyte shipment into the enterprise market were up 15% quarter-over-quarter at 38 exabyte. Nearline drive accounted for more than 90% of that total, with average capacity per nearline drive in nearly 8 terabytes.","Revenue from 12 terabytes and higher capacity drives now represent more than 50% of total nearline revenue compared with 36% in the prior quarter. We have successfully qualified our 16 terabyte drive with the number of customer and we expect shipment volume to increase through the fiscal year. Revenue for the edge noncompute market which includes surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR, and consumer application, increased to 34% of the total June quarter revenue compared to 32% in the prior quarter.","Forecast for the calendar year is typically a weaker period for the edge noncompute market. We saw some acceleration in demand from a few surveillance and gaming customers, which led to a sequential increase in revenue and exabyte shipments. We shipped a total of 33 exabytes into the edge noncompute market during the June quarter compared to 29 exabytes in the prior period.","Moving now to nearline application, the majority of edge noncompute platforms require a reliable and secure mass data storage, which is we\u2019re aligned to high-capacity disk drives. Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook hard disk drives, contributed 18% of total revenue, relative to 20% of revenue in the March quarter.","This exabyte shipment down approximately 6% to 14 exabyte, reflecting typical seasonality. Our non-hard disk drive business, including cloud systems and SSD solutions made up the remaining 7% of June quarter revenue, down from 8% in the prior year period. The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline was mainly driven by lower demand from our enterprise SSD customers.","Revenue for our cloud system business was slightly down quarter-over-quarter. However, we improved operating profit, which reflect our ability to transition our portfolio to higher revenue products. During the quarter, we jointly announced a new partnership with Cloudian a private cloud market opportunity, across healthcare and research and media and entertainment. Decline The Cloudian solution will be powered by Seagate 15 terabyte high-capacity drives and our new high density product platform, which deliver a cost-effective solution for large-scale deployment.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 26.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially on a more favorable product mix. Consistent with our expectations, during the June quarter, we incurred underutilization cost, which we\u2019re only trying to improve from the March quarter and thus, negatively impacting gross margin. We continue to profitably manage our manufacturing outlook while I\u2019m closely with the demand environment, which is that in control for higher capacity drives. Therefore, we are expanding our production capabilities to address future growth opportunities.","As a result of this dynamic, underutilization cost will remain a headwind on gross margin until demand fully out of production capacity later in the calendar year. We efficiently managed our non-GAAP operating expenses for the income flat quarter-over-quarter at $350 million, down nearly $50 million from the year-ago period. The combination of slightly higher gross margin and flat operating expenses resulting in non- GAAP EPS of $0.86, for the June quarter, as a high-end of our guidance range and reflecting our ongoing operational efficiency and the expense activity.","Cash flow from operations was $448 million in the June quarter. Capital expenditures, were $151 million in the June quarter, and about $600 million for the fiscal year, which was just below 6% of full year revenue. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, we expect CapEx to be near the midpoint of our target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue to support our plan to increase our manufacturing Exabyte capacity to address growing demand.","Free cash flow was a healthy $297 million for the June quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we received a cash payment of $1.35 billion from Toshiba Memory Holding Company, for the early redemption of outstanding shares we had with the company. As a reminder, just over a year ago, Seagate made a $1.27 billion investment in TMC preferred shares. The proceeds represent our original investment as well a good interest income.","During the June quarter, we retired $272 million in debt, including the repayment of our revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, the company debt balance was $4.25 billion, with a gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITA ratio of just below two times. We repurchased 7.8 million ordinary shares or $350 million, in stating our view Seagate share represent in an attractive investment. We exit the June quarter with 269 million ordinary shares outstanding, down 6% from the prior year.","At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization. Our Board has again approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2019. Through the combination of dividends and share buyback, Seagate returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholder in fiscal year 2019 or about 145% of free cash flow, which reflect our focus on enhancing shareholder value.","As of the end of June, cash and cash equivalents were at $2.2 billion, up $832 million from the prior quarter, with an additional $1.5 billion available through our revolver.","As we enter fiscal year 2020, the industry landscape is improving, and we remain focused on executing plans to expand our manufacturing capacity to address growing demand for mass capacity storage. While reductions as a near-term impact from gross margin, we believe they position Seagate well to capitalize on future growth opportunities.","Prior to sharing our quarterly outlook, I would like to outline a change to our financial reporting. Starting in the September quarter, we will begin, excluding share-based compensation expense, from our non-GAAP results because companies utilize different factors and methodologies to calculate their spend, as well as to be more consistent with the majority of our industry peers. This expense is approximately $30 million per quarter, of which majority is included in operating expenses.","I would also point out that September quarter give the 14-week period, and we expect to incur additional operating expenses due to higher variable compensation and weak in the quarter. We expect the net impact to operating expense to be an additional $20 million in the September quarter.","Taking these factors into account, our outlook for the September quarter is as follows. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 5%. Non-GAAP gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially; non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, plus or minus 5%. While the macro environment continues to be the near-term demand, we expect Exabyte volumes to meaningfully grow.","Over the long term, our focus on the cash generation and a solid balance sheet will provide us the financial strength to capitalize on future storage growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value.","I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Gianluca. To summarize, Seagate is executing well on its strategic priorities to optimize profit and free cash flow. We are continuing to manage the business intelligently through industry related cycles and the current market dynamics. Over the longer term, we believe the fundamental demand for data is driving the need for mass storage capacity. Seagate is creating solutions to help customers manage the exponential volumes of data securely, efficiently and cost-effectively.","As we enter fiscal 2020, I am confident that we have the financial foundation, manufacturing expertise and technology portfolio to capitalize on these future growth opportunities. We will be hosting an analyst event on September 19 in New York City, where we plan to outline our strategy in more detail.","Before opening the call for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for all their contributions to the success of our business.","Gianluca and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m surprised gross margin didn\u2019t recover more in the June quarter given the 10% increase in exabytes shipped and the improvement in nearline and in surveillance. It sounds like underutilization is still an issue. Does that tie entirely to the 16 terabyte investments? Or are there other areas of the business where you\u2019re seeing underutilization? And then just how should we think about the progression of gross margins over the next couple of quarters as 16 terabyte ramps? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Katy. At a very high level, no, it doesn\u2019t tie to the ramp of the 16 terabyte, but I\u2019ll describe the market dynamics and then let Gianluca do a walk on specific impacts if that\u2019s more helpful. I don\u2019t think we should underestimate the disruptions in the market from a demand perspective that we saw in Q4 and continue to see ramifications of the Q1. There\u2019s a lot of supply that was pushed into the market, I think into channels that are not necessarily tied to revenue quickly. And that\u2019s partly because people were buying things in anticipation of maybe supply disruptions that didn\u2019t happen. And I think those factors have actually played into the quarter to quarter compare, and may even be a little bit of part of underutilization as well just as we try to tie those things back together because, as you know, we like to build only what the customers absolutely need and those disruptions have impacted us.","I think if I step to the very high level in the industry and look at revenue per terabyte, you can see the revenue per terabyte is going down quite a bit. Now, some of that\u2019s the transition to higher capacity drives, some of that\u2019s, in fact, the cloud is still not fully turned on, but you can see that competitive progress there. How do we get out of it and when as to your question, that\u2019s when we can go drive cost per terabyte. And the biggest product that we have coming there is going to be impactful as 16 as well. But I\u2019ll let Gianluca do the walk as well.","Gianluca Romano","Yes. Hi, Katy. So in terms of underutilization cost, in F Q4 we still add about 100 basis points of gross margin that we lost due to underutilization. The overall gross margin was fairly well aligned to our guidance. And as you know, even in EPS we are actually higher than the midpoint of our guidance. So I don\u2019t know, our expectation was to have a much higher gross margin for F Q4.","In F Q1, you\u2019ll still have some underutilization cost impacting the gross margin, less than in F Q4, but still probably 50, 60 basis points. So as Dave said, it\u2019s not really related to the 16 terabyte specifically, but we are adding capacity to our manufacturing capabilities because of our expectation of much higher volume coming in the next few quarters. So until we ramp all our production and fulfill the factories, we will add some underutilization costs. And as Dave said, there\u2019s also some pricing pressure in the market that is keeping gross margin maybe a bit lower than what you were expecting.","And maybe, let me take the opportunity to talk about also EPS for F Q1. So we guided $0.90 plus or minus 5%. But there are several items that will impact EPS in Q1 in different direction. So first of all, we will have the positive impact of higher revenue, it\u2019s a similar gross as we guided. We also have a positive impact from excluding share-based compensation starting F Q1 in order to be better aligned to our competitors and the normal practice in the industry. And then we have a couple of negative impact. One is OpEx because F Q1 is a 14-week quarter, we will add about $20 million, $25 million higher OpEx in the quarter, and we also have higher OpEx due to the variable compensation. So that is probably another $20 million.","Finally, we also have lower interest income because we redeemed our investment in Toshiba. As you know, that investment was generating about $20 million of interest income that we will not have in F Q1, so which is how probably you kind of consolidate $0.86 in F Q4 to the $0.90 in F Q1.","Katy Huberty","That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Hi. Good morning. Sorry for the background noise. Just one question. As you ramp 16 terabytes in the interim, is there a meaningful share loss at the cloud that we should consider? And so can you sort of give us a sense for how that sort of plays out over the next few quarters? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Yes, thanks, Steven. The way I think about it is we\u2019re ramping 16s and communicating to our customers what we want to do on 16s. That\u2019s the platform and we didn\u2019t just stage this platform last month, we\u2019ve been working on for years. So that\u2019s the platform we\u2019ve been out selling to our customers, getting them to align to, getting them aligned on the ramps and so on.","So to your point, especially when the market is relatively software nearline, we\u2019ve been down, it\u2019s actually starting to pick backup as we talked about, but it\u2019s not \u2013 still not up to full speed and you can see that versus where we were say a year ago when things were really hot. We don\u2019t \u2013 we want to make sure we don\u2019t push the wrong drives out there.","So from our perspective, let\u2019s not overbuild say for example on 12s or 10s and push those into slots that ultimately the customers, maybe they don\u2019t want for their long-term TCO proposition, they\u2019re going to be putting these data centers up and running the drives for five, seven years, so the TCO proposition for the 16 is huge. We don\u2019t want to be temporarily going after that. So if you call that share loss or something like that, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s not a metric we\u2019re really managing onto your point.","Steven Fox","Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thanks. Two real quick questions if I can. So first of all, just kind of trying to understand the gross margin trajectory from here, can you help us appreciate at what level of capacity shipments on a quarterly basis you think that you kind of fully absorb the underutilization of your fabs? I mean, is that north of 100 exabytes or I\u2019m just trying to understand or frame that as we kind of build the model. And again, I do have a follow-up.","Dave Mosley","Yes, that\u2019s good, Aaron. And I think it\u2019s a good way to think about it. So this time last year we were in north of 100 exabytes, and then we\u2019ve dipped down in the 80s in the last couple of quarters when things have been soft. I think we need to get up over 100 now and we\u2019re installing capacity for that. And largely a portion, it\u2019s not just 16 terabytes, right? It\u2019s some of the low cap stuff moving to 8 terabytes and some of the surveillance markets, edge storage markets moving to 4 and 8 terabytes and so on, exactly to your point, but that\u2019s the \u2013 those are the utilization targets that we\u2019ve got set and we think it\u2019s going to come, so we\u2019re staging for it.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And then just not to read too much between the lines, but last quarter, I think you said that the nearline capacity shipments for fiscal 2020 may exceed 35 to 40. Now you\u2019re saying \u201cwell above that range, that long-term margin\u201d. So can you help us understand or maybe define what well above means?","Dave Mosley","Yes, I think that goes back to deep collaborative work with our customers and talking about what exactly they need when they need it and making sure that our ramps are big enough and flexible enough to be able to accommodate their needs. It goes without saying that that 16 terabytes and above, 18 terabytes when we get there, 20 terabytes when we get there, are very meaningful TCO improvements for the customers. They \u2013 depending on which ones they may be cycling out old equipment, they may be building new data centers as part of their plans, but all of that improves their capability and they\u2019re going to be running the gear for a long time. So we think we\u2019re up against a fairly, fairly big bubble this time in exabytes.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dave Mosley","Hello?","Operator","C.J., are you there?","Dave Mosley","C.J.?","Christopher Muse","Yes. Can you hear me?","Dave Mosley","Now I can.","Christopher Muse","Yes, sorry about that. I guess, for the September model, I\u2019m having difficulty hitting the numbers. So I guess could you provide guide for OpEx and gross margins including stock-based comp?","Gianluca Romano","No, I just think we will do that, but we [indiscernible] $20 million, so you can cut buybacks early\u2026","Christopher Muse","So I should be thinking $30 million, plus $20 million, plus $25 million, so $75 million higher OpEx Q on Q including stock-based comp?","Gianluca Romano","No. So OpEx stock-based compensation is about $20 million. So you have $20 million that is not included in our guidance because of the stock-based compensation. The 14-week, so the extra week in the quarter, is a similar amount, so $20 million. And then because we\u2019re entering into a new fiscal year in the guidance, there is an assumption for variable compensation that is higher than what we had in the prior quarter. So you need to add all those items and come up.","Christopher Muse","Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, can you speak to, as you think about gross margins and I know you\u2019re focusing on underutilization, but is the 16 terabyte transition having any impact there? And at what point should that be mitigated?","Gianluca Romano","So we are ramping the 16 terabyte. As you know, the expectation for demand is really strong, but it\u2019s a time like between when we start the capacity and when we can really ramp the production. So this is why we still have some underutilization cost. But depending from how much additional capacity we will add in the next few quarters, but we expect to be fully \u2013 close to be at capacity fairly quick, probably a couple of quarters.","Christopher Muse","Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Yes. I think you can start to see that C.J. in our CapEx numbers a little bit, if you look year-over-year as we\u2019re staging the right technology to be able to get to that. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we reinforced the expectation for revenue growth and FY 2020 as well is because we\u2019re getting to the point where we believe that those TCO propositions are so advantageous that people will stretch for that.","Christopher Muse","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dave and Gianluca, just \u2013 I have two, if I could. The first is just sticking with gross margin, Dave, the metrics around utilization, how to get the margins going, what you\u2019re seeing for the 100 terabytes, that\u2019s really helpful. My question in that regard is, last cycle when you hit that 100, the gross margins I believe are close to 32.5%. And so could you just give us a little more context on, is that the ultimate ceiling again? I guess it\u2019s around the sliding scale and the 100 terabytes. And how we should think about what ceiling could be this time? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Dave Mosley","I\u2019m glad you asked that. If I think about gross margin percent, we don\u2019t manage the business on a day to day perspective for gross margin percent, but it\u2019s a long-term planning item. So when we say last cycle, gosh, it was only a year ago. It just \u2013 it feels like the cycles are going very, very quickly. We\u2019re investing to be able to hit the peaks of those cycles better to your point. And then, I think there\u2019s competition as well, which is to my comments \u2013 commentary about revenue per terabyte. We need to get cost per terabyte down, but we also have to realize the revenue per terabyte is coming down fairly aggressively as we move. So all these things factor in.","Over a longer period of time, the margin range serves as a guide for how we \u2013 how much we want to invest, where we think we\u2019re going to go. And I think if you look over the entire fiscal year, to your point, you saw a peak and a valley, if you will. We think there\u2019s another peak coming as well, exactly to your point. So if we \u2013 I think if we get to the top end of the range again, we earned it, and we would also, I would also always ask the team though, kind of in quarter if we have the opportunity to go grab dollars, even if they\u2019re dilutive to gross margin percentage, we\u2019ll take it tactically. Does that make sense?","Ananda Baruah","Yes, it does. It does, Dave. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate it. And then the second \u2013 and then the follow-up is just with regard to 16 terabytes, kind of quality and progression, I believe sort of 90 days ago or at least as we 60 days ago let\u2019s say, you guys were expecting to get the volume September quarter and some context on 60 terabytes, and then to really sort of see things kick up in the December quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re still expecting that in the December quarter of, how is the progression relative to prior expectations through the September quarter? Appreciate it.","Dave Mosley","Yes, we\u2019re on a fairly aggressive ramp. And remember that the lead times for things like heads and discs and drives are getting longer, especially on these big capacity drives, but we\u2019re still driving it. The qualifications have \u2013 really don\u2019t have any significant technical hitches at this point, some have timed out. There\u2019s a few that are for various reasons, customers that pushed a few weeks because their tools weren\u2019t ready or because they\u2019re not ready to intercept with \u2013 where they want to, to be able to take a 16 terabyte and a lot of that is about where they want to go. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re pretty happy and we\u2019re definitely staging materials.","Ananda Baruah","I appreciate it.","Gianluca Romano","And, Ananda, you are correct. You will see a big ramp in the December quarter. So we are very active already in this quarter, but you will see much more volume starting next quarter.","Ananda Baruah","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First, I was hoping to follow-up more on the commentary around revenue per bid. And Dave, you spoke about dual-actuators and improved performance. How do you think that translates into your ability to improve the pricing? What sort of price premium you can get for that type of technology? And as there\u2019s some sort of additional costs, kind of relates to that, what would the gross margin implications be as well?","Dave Mosley","It\u2019s an interesting space, Mark. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s near-term. So just to be quite frank, I think there are some smaller customers who have very high performance workloads, who are really pushing for this technology. And there are some smaller divisions of cloud service providers because of everything \u2013 all cloud service providers are not created equal and many have different workloads.","So where this technology is immediately applicable is a subset. I think the technology over time becomes much more important. And I would think about it as above 20 terabytes. They\u2019re multiple \u2013 you just can\u2019t continue to have bigger drives all behind one actuator at a relative IOPS per terabyte streaming speed that\u2019s less, if that makes sense. So we need to go to this technology. I think it\u2019ll be competitive and I think we\u2019re being driven very hard for it. But I also think it provides \u2013 since we\u2019re providing so much more value and if we happen to outcompete, it should be good for us.","I think the other interesting thing about the technology is everything I just said about the cloud it\u2019s very applicable back into the edge data centers, which are right now starved for that value I think from a lower cost per terabyte perspective, but also from a performance perspective, and then the rest of the edge is also. If we talk about surveillance drives or something, we\u2019re getting driven for multiple streams in surveillance drives. So the technology is probably relevant there too, but I just want to be very upfront and say that the first instantiation now that we\u2019re shipping these products is going to be, the early adopters if you will, are going to be more niche for awhile.","Mark Delaney","It\u2019s helpful, guys. And my follow-up question, during the past quarter the company announced the EVP of sales will be leading later this year. Can you talk about how Seagate plans to fill that sales position? And are you contemplating, making changes in how you\u2019re going to market going forward? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Yes, thanks for the question. It\u2019s interesting though. I won\u2019t talk about any individual staffing that we\u2019ll do, but I will say that we\u2019re planning on changing how we go to market. It\u2019s really interesting the markets are changing very quickly. The customer types are changing, the customers just even talked about on this call versus two or three years ago. So exactly to your point, there\u2019s a lot of changes going on.","The Seagate team is pretty deep. I think as everybody knows, been together for a long time. And I have a ton of faith in the rest of the team. I really think we\u2019ve made great transitions in the last three years and some with Jim\u2019s help. I think going forward we\u2019re going to have to rely on the growth of the Seagate team. And so from my perspective, I am very focused on what \u2013 who are the new customers, how are they going to buy, how do we adapt to them, and then there\u2019s some investments we\u2019re probably going to have to make.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Karl Ackerman","Hey, good morning. Dave or Gianluca, clearly your PC exposed drives have decelerated last few quarters, presumably following the normalization of NAND ASPs that, I think may get a little bit more economical for SSDs in those environments. Now the past, you\u2019ve kind of acted that headwind by raising the density per drive, while using only one platter. But I guess, from here, how should we think about the leverage you can pull on the cost side to stabilize that business?","Dave Mosley","Karl, it\u2019s interesting. As we said the script that \u2013 we talked about how we are doing minimal investments in some of these spaces. But I think what\u2019s important is we\u2019re managing the business for free cash flow over the long term, not over the short term, right? And some of these markets are still, without with minimal investment, the free cash flow is still quite good, operating margins still quite good.","As a matter of fact, I would argue that today, the competitor, if you will, that you just talked about being flash drives or something like that are not as good. So \u2013 but there is reality of the marketplace. So we\u2019re not really investing a lot in those places, we\u2019ll continue to run them over the long-haul and think about them as, how do we generate free cash flow. There will be disruptions in some of those spaces, we forecast that over time. But I think we have to be careful because the tail is actually quite long as well. I just pick on PCs for a second, because a lot of people like to talk about it.","From my perspective, from a hard drive perspective, PCs \u2013 the interesting one for hard drives already have full drives in them, so it\u2019s actually a longer tail. And there\u2019s a reason why the HDDs in their end, the ASPs in their end, so I don\u2019t really think of it as per se at either\/or. And then the other thing to keep in mind is, we\u2019re off to service our customers and our customers kind of dictate the demand, we don\u2019t make demand by our strategy, we don\u2019t think of it that way. So hope that helps you.","Gianluca Romano","And if I can add something on free cash flow. I think it\u2019s very important to keep in mind that even during a quarter that is down cycle quarter, Seagate was able to generate $300 million in free cash flow, and was very similar last quarter. So I think either change compared to what was in the past. So even during down cycle time, the focus on free cash flow is giving very good results.","Karl Ackerman","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Yes. David, from a big picture, it\u2019s very interesting and support of you having confidence in your enterprise exabyte for FY2020, can you put that in context and give some framework as to how the overall exabyte would grow FY2020 versus FY2019? And I have a follow-up.","Dave Mosley","Sorry, I didn\u2019t catch the very last part of it. Can you just repeat the very last sentence?","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure, sure. I was just going back to your enterprise exabyte growth of well over 35% to 40% for FY2020. How does that impact your overall exabyte shipment when you put the overall exabyte shipment in the context given how comfortable you are with the enterprise segment?","Dave Mosley","Oh, I see, I see. Okay. Yes. Becoming a bigger and bigger portion, I think in the script, we talked about it already being 50%. So from my perspective, it\u2019s going to be a bigger, bigger portion and the leverage that we get because we\u2019re doing fewer drive types than before, I think we\u2019ll get relatively better payout. If I think about the large part of the driver for exabyte growth, it\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re getting higher capacity points, 2016 versus 2010 in the last peak of the last cycle. And I am not saying that the hard drive sites is the primary driver that I think there are many drivers, but I think that\u2019s the biggest thing driving us near term.","Longer term, to your point, if I think about enterprise, the cloud will continue to grow. The cloud will continue to cycle through some of their existing footprint and upgrade as well, but I think data is still going to grow in the cloud. I think the other interesting topic that we have going on right now, is that on prime data centers, data is being repatriated but there\u2019s a market difference in the cost between the cloud and the on-prem. And what we\u2019re seeing is lot of people in the on-prem where we\u2019re going to have focus on high-performance storage, and that\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s going to be a lot of needs for compute there, and the high-performance storage or high-performance memory, if you will, need to be very close to that compute.","But in order to put the extreme data growth is going on, in order to have enterprise growth in those places, you\u2019re going to need cost-effective solutions vis-a-vis the cloud. So we\u2019d see a great opportunity there. We talked about it a little bit in the script, and I think that\u2019s also an opportunity for us to get to market little bit faster with the same technology, and that will drive exabyte growth.","Mehdi Hosseini","If I may refine my question, if your enterprise exabyte is growing over 35%, 40%, your surveillance consumer electronic exabyte growing at a faster rate, would those two help you with double-digit total exabyte growth?","Dave Mosley","Eventually, they\u2019ll take over, maybe back to Karl\u2019s question, eventually, they will take over from some of the more legacy systems from an Exabyte perspective, exactly to your point. What we\u2019ve seen about some of that edge storage like surveillance, it\u2019s been a little choppy like the cloud has. And unfortunately, sometimes they phase up, and you don\u2019t see it. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s easy on rolling one-, two-, three-quarter basis to draw any trends. But certainly, over the last three or four years, if you start drawing the cloud trend again, the edge storage trends that are around surveillance then it presents a pretty good story.","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much and thus far, your answers have been very useful. I just wanted to make sure I heard and understand correctly on the gross margin and underutilization. The June quarter, it was about a 100 basis points in the September outlook, about 50 to 60 basis points but then you\u2019re going to be adding and filling the more capacity with more volume. So should be normalizing pretty quick after the September quarter, is that the way to think about the impact past and forward?","Gianluca Romano","Yes. I think that\u2019s the right way. Of course, depends how much capacity we will end in the December quarter and the following quarters. But I think from a moderate standpoint, you are correct.","Jim Suva","And then my last question is, just knowing the cycle time with the throughput of your production, I would assume the materiality of the revenues kind of come in probably after the December quarter because you simply don\u2019t turn on the fabs and then it comes out perfect right away, probably more like the March quarter as opposed to the December quarter? Or do you think December quarter will be the full run rate of the revenues coming out of your increased capacity?","Gianluca Romano","I think it\u2019s difficult to note that. I think right now for December or later quarters but, of course, it\u2019s different from how much we in 15 terabyte. And as we said before, we will intend to ramp into December quarter and after that. So you will have probably more impact in the next few quarters.","Dave Mosley","It\u2019s a good way to think about lead times, because we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen right now on when people will pull. But relative to what we are staging from a materials perspective, we\u2019re staging those parts that will go against that ramp, and it\u2019s being \u2013 we\u2019re being very aggressive with that. Does that make sense?","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for your details of question. It\u2019s greatly appreciating.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho","Great. Thank for taking my question. You talked about the improving demand condition, especially for hyperscale customers. Can you just add some color as to how broad-based that strengthens and given you are more than \u2013 if my numbers are right, given the numbers \u2013 your exabyte is still about 20% below a year ago, when do you think that on the Exabyte basis that nearline drives to get back to year-over-year growth?","Dave Mosley","Year-over-year growth, I think is coming, certainly, in FY2020. Some of it depends if we talk about just an Exabyte growth, some of it depends on the specifics to the ramp of the 2016, and I don\u2019t want to get any further ahead than next quarter. But what I would say is you\u2019re on the right point, which is last year, the drives, the factories were full at Q4 to Q1. This year, as we go through \u2013 as we\u2019re ramping right now, we\u2019re definitely staging to be able to capture the peak of that cycle again.","And I think we make that available for \u2013 to guide the eye, if you will, on our Investor Relations websites to show those cloud cycles. And what we\u2019ve seen over time is that the peaks and valleys, if you will, of the climb and the cloud have really been fairly predictable, things can always get thrown off just a little bit, but we believe there\u2019s another one coming in and it\u2019s certainly consistent with the discussions we\u2019re having with our customers.","Gianluca Romano","Yes. So, we expect a very good increase in exabyte or readiness Q1 for the nearline.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Munjal Shah from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Munjal Shah","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter you mentioned that nearline ramp would be wider and higher. Do you still expect that or do you think it\u2019s going to be coming back much stronger? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","Yes, I think, let me say in this way, that the data center build-outs that we\u2019ve typically heard of it [Audio Gap] to last August and September specifically, some of the plans and a lot of places they\u2019ve just been postponed for various reasons. There are other people who, you can tell data just growing and gets their application and they want to continue to invest, but they wait for the right architectural decisions. Sometimes it\u2019s the hard drive capacity points, sometimes it has to do with other architectures that are going on. So I \u2013 it\u2019s hard to point to paint the cloud with a uniform brush because there\u2019s so many different applications and strategies that are going on. But I do think, the overall data group is very consistent and that\u2019s what drives that period is the data that we\u2019re referring to.","A little wider and deeper this time. Maybe, I think, certainly has felt like that in the last six months, and I think what I said a year and a half ago with the geographically we\u2019re starting to see enough diversity that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as deep. Clearly the markets have been fairly disturbed in the last six months. But I think that that overall data growth, the demand for places to put the data is still there and driving that trend.","Munjal Shah","Just to follow-up. So when we see the next ramp, are we seeing from existing applications or do you think those build-outs that push out are starting to happen from the data?","Dave Mosley","Yes, that\u2019s certainly true. Yes, there are new applications coming online. I wouldn\u2019t talk about any specific customers of course, but there are new applications.","Munjal Shah","All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mitch Steven from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Mitch Steven","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had one just to talk about little bit FY2020, I know you guys gave the exact guidance, but even though this year has been a little bit of a strange year in terms of the first half being a weaker in terms of the calendar year, when we look at 2020, should we assume that it\u2019s going to be more of a typical seasonal year for you guys or is there anything else we should be aware of? It sounds like maybe two for the more seasonally strong, just looking for any sort of high level comments in terms of that seasonality next year.","Stephen Luczo","Yes, interesting. I think Mitch, there\u2019s still seasonality at some parts of like for example, consumer\u2019s still very seasonal. As we have less and less exposure to things like PC, some of the traditional seasonal spikes that we would see that are very predictable or are not there as much in this, as we talked about earlier, some of the PC, design points are changing a little bit, they may be changed \u2013 they may be, the seasonality may be changing. The cloud and surveillance market \u2013surveillance used to have a little bit of seasonality. I think it\u2019s been a little disrupted. So, I would say it\u2019s a seasonal and the cloud certainly a seasonal and go through different patterns and because the spikes that we talk about.","With all these things considered though, just looking at the data growth, the total data growth over the last few years, we think FY2019 exactly to your point, people have been very conservative and in FY2020, they\u2019re going to have to go invest in data and that\u2019s why we have confidence in revenue growth.","Mitch Steven","Perfect. And then just one last follow-up just on the enterprise side, and we saw what \u2013 sorry, what NetApp posted during the year preannounced. So I guess is there anything there that was surprising to you guys in terms of their comments or do you guys think that there would be more company specific? Anything you\u2019d give in terms of why their mess is so much worse versus what you\u2019re kind of talking to in terms of demand?","Dave Mosley","I wouldn\u2019t talk about a specific person. I would say it\u2019s super interesting to me, what\u2019s going on in on-prem enterprise. I think if I look over the last five to 10 years, there\u2019ve been people very focused on high performance rigs and that\u2019s important. We see it in the \u2013 our own data centers that we have to build. But we also see a lot of people want to grow the data on-prem for themselves, whether it\u2019s their own control, their own application control. Some people talk about repatriation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good way to think about it. Because I think the cloud will grow substantially and the applications in the cloud are have a great value proposition as well.","But I do think that on-prem low cost, efficient, storage to cover the entire life cycle of data. Not just the compute, but the life cycle of the data is super important. And I think some companies have been very focused and that\u2019s their business model to be very focused on high performance. I think there\u2019s an opportunity for all of us, for everybody in this more economical on-prem stuff. And I \u2013 and we pointed to that a little bit in our script, and I think it\u2019s a space to watch in the next five years.","Mitch Steven","Very helpful. Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes. Hi guys. Just between a on the hyperscale side, there\u2019s been some confusion in terms of as you look at the back half, it demand, if there\u2019s a difference in demand pickup between enterprise and hyperscale, or what you\u2019re seeing geographically in terms of nearline demand picking up between U.S. and Chinese customers? Appreciate any color there?","Dave Mosley","Yes, it has been a little choppy this year, that\u2019s for sure. I think, there\u2019s various reasons for that, but overall most of the discussions we\u2019re having with our customers are \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more planning involved. So is there a data center going to be built or are you going to be transitioning some of your old gear into new gear or new applications coming online to that point. We do feel that the last six months or nine months geographically, there\u2019ve been a lot of people just say, I\u2019m on hold, we\u2019ll come back to this. But some of the business models are still desired in place. And then there may even be new ones are coming up, which I think causes some of this choppiness that we see in the nearline next by demand.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And I know this is very recent, but in terms of some of these status again going back in place in a month\u2019s time. Any thoughts? I know this is really [Audio Gap]. Thanks.","Gianluca Romano","We don\u2019t expect an impact from the new\u2026","Dave Mosley","From the new ones. I think, from our perspective, there\u2019s a lot of things that we\u2019re obviously working with our customers through we tend to focus on \u2013 do we have the right stuff in the right place at the right time. We react to these things just like everyone else does. I think we have pretty robust supply chain that we can react quickly. So from the new tariff side, I think there\u2019s minimal impact. And everybody is analyzing the same things in the world, and going through the same things. We\u2019re Seagate\u2019s markedly similar to everyone else and I\u2019ve heard their earnings calls, it\u2019s \u2013 you can tell other people are struggling with it a little bit more, but I think we\u2019re dealing with it.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Dave Mosley for closing remarks.","Dave Mosley","Okay. Thanks everyone joining us today in Dublin. And thanks for your interest in Seagate. I would once again like to thank our customers and our suppliers and business partners and all of our employees for their contributions to our fourth quarter performance. Also like to thank our shareholders for your ongoing support. We look forward to seeing you all at an Analyst Event in New York on September 19th.

My name is Melanie, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ","This conference call contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements related to the company's future operating and financial performance in the December 2011 quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.","Such risks, uncertainties and other factors may be beyond the company's control. In particular, global economic conditions and significant disruption to the industry supply chain from the severe flooding throughout parts of Thailand may pose a risk to the company's operating and financial performance.","Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K\/A, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 17, 2011, and August 24, 2011, respectively, and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2011. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date, and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead.","Stephen J. Luczo","Thank you, Melanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me from Seagate are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Mosley, Executive Vice President of Operations; Rocky Pimentel, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Ken Massaroni, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.","We have posted detailed supplemental information about our fiscal second quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. In today's call, I will review the results for the December 2011 quarter, provide an update on our Thailand operations and our view of the impact of the flooding, share our progress on the Samsung hard drive business integration and provide our outlook for our fiscal third and fourth quarters, as well as calendar year 2012. After that, we'll open up the call to questions and answers.","For the December quarter, the industry shipped approximately 119 million units, which was within our expected range. Seagate reported revenue of $3.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32. We shipped 47 million units during the quarter, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.7%. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash.","The disaster in Thailand affected a vast number of individuals and thousands of businesses. Although the industry is continuing to increase output, it's important to note that while many observers tend to believe that mid to late October was the low point of industry production, we believe the low point was closer to mid-December.","Seagate's geographically diversified factory footprint and broad supply chain provided inherent advantages that mitigated the impact of the floods to Seagate's operations, although many of our external component suppliers are still working to recover their businesses and return to full capacity. We have been very impressed with the response and efforts of our suppliers, who have worked tirelessly to rebound from the effects of the flooding. There are still clear challenges that lie ahead in our component supply chain. And to help address the gaps in various product lines, Seagate has worked with its customers and suppliers on aggressive qualifications of new parts and factories, allowing us to match precious supply to end demand.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Mosley, who will provide more detail on the situation in Thailand.","William David Mosley","Thanks, Steve. The human tragedy that surrounds the flooding in Thailand is deeply troubling, and our thoughts go out all of those affected, especially our employees and their families. To put the disaster in an economic perspective, it is by some measures the fourth-largest natural disaster in history. So far, estimates are at $45 billion of damage, and 13 million lives were disrupted.","The damages done by the flooding created by far the most stressful quarter in the history of the disk drive supply chain. The flood was most impactful in the industrial parks approximately 30 miles north of downtown Bangkok, where 7 of our top 10 suppliers suffered direct factory damage. As a result, all of our 20-plus product platforms experienced some form of supply interruption, and for a few products, the damage brought down the supply lines completely.","Components have had varying degrees of challenges in the recovery. Specifically, a large portion of the precision machining capability that supports the hard drive industry, the motors and base decks to actuators and specialty mechanical parts, were catastrophically lost. In some cases, various fixtures were salvaged, while in other cases our suppliers have had to rush to secure new tooling. To date, over 200 requalifications have occurred for motor base assemblies alone. Also, many cleanroom facilities that support the industry, where contamination control is critical, were destroyed. Even certain electrical component manufacturing was damaged, impacting parts from IC packaging to individual discretes like capacitors.","In addition, we're seeing much longer than usual lead times for certain pieces of capital equipment. Some sub-suppliers have limited access to capital to rebuild their systems and get back online, and Seagate is working with many of its suppliers to provide assistance where it can to accelerate the return of those businesses. Examples include temporary changes in payment terms, adaptation of our product portfolio to match their capabilities and assistance in funding for capital equipment. We believe these structural changes occurring in the supply chain today will have a lasting impact on the long-term structure of the industry. We are also working to ensure these relationships will lessen future risks in supply chain disruptions.","With these impacts and the temporary underutilization of our in-house capacity, our average unit costs went up approximately $2.50 in the December quarter. I would like to thank our suppliers for their efforts in these trying times. In particular, vendors have shown their dedication to our industry and our mutual end-customers to prioritize urgent product gaps and restore high-quality production as soon as possible. Steve?","Stephen J. Luczo","Thanks, Dave. In response to the supply chain disruptions in the December quarter, Seagate dramatically reduced product configuration complexity and moved the vast majority of our fulfillment process to direct factory shipments. These efforts have fundamentally altered demand planning dynamics with our customers and have resulted in a much better alignment of supply and demand. We expect that these improvements to supply chain management will become standard practice as our industry fully recovers over the course of calendar 2012, benefiting our industry, suppliers and customers.","Our average selling price per unit for the quarter was approximately $13 higher than they were in the September quarter. While market conditions would have clearly supported a higher price for our products across our portfolio, we balance this condition with the needs of our customers and suppliers, as well as our objective for more stability in our margins. We made the business decision to trade a short-term, profit-maximizing opportunity for long-term commitments from customers, stronger relationships and more stable margins.","As a result of improvements in supply-demand alignment and our approach to pricing, nearly all of our largest customers have entered into binding long-term agreements or LTAs to ensure continuity of their hard disk drive supply. Some of these LTAs extend for multiple years. LTAs of this nature are new to the disk drive industry and represent a structural change in the way we do business. These agreements are mutually beneficial and improve the strategic alignment between Seagate and its customers by improving forecast accuracy, unit volume and pricing visibility, product build planning and logistics.","The executed LTAs are expected to account for an excess of 60% of our total production capacity during the calendar year. These volume commitments were made while considering our broader business, which includes the global distribution channel, our own branded retail business and other OEMs who have not executed LTAs. We are receiving additional requests for LTAs from our customers, and we will evaluate our ability to meet those requests while ensuring that our customers have adequate supply to achieve their business objectives.","The current industry environment has also created changes within our distribution channel, including the elimination of programs that historically have complicated pricing and reduced transparency. We believe these changes will improve the profitability of our distribution partners and also result in better alignment of supply and demand, reducing the potential for excess inventory.","Finally, in order to provide our customers another channel to access Seagate products, we are planning to auction approximately 200,000 drives later this week. In addition to making drives available for those qualified customers not covered by an LTA or where LTA volumes are not sufficient to cover their needs, this will allow us to fully understand and gauge marginal pricing. We have over 50 customers already committed to participate in the first auction. Our current expectation is that we will be conducting auctions periodically during this and future quarters. ","As previously mentioned, product configurations were dramatically reduced in the December quarter. As a result, we have accelerated most of the critical product transitions we discussed in last quarter's call. We prioritized transitions in desktop, nearline and mission-critical to speed volume recovery, and we have made substantial progress in manufacturing yields across all these programs. Our 500-gigabyte per disk notebook products are still on the plan, and they will be substantially completed with this transition in the next 6 months. ","As previously reported, we closed the acquisition of Samsung's hard drive business on December 19, and our integration of the Samsung business is largely complete, and the transition has progressed as expected. The logistics to complete the shift of Samsung's disk drive operations to Seagate's system are closely coordinated, and the completion of this move is a testament to the solid work of our integration and operations team.  In the final weeks of 2011, Seagate shipped approximately 700,000 Samsung drives using Seagate's global systems.","The acquisition includes the addition of Samsung's Spinpoint M8 series to Seagate's 2.5-inch product portfolio. This product delivers industry-leading capacity and is a volume leader that will significantly improve Seagate's position as a supplier of 2.5-inch products.","As with many other product lines, external component shortages resulting from the Thailand floods have constrained the production of this product. We are now seeing incremental improvements in the ramp of this product and expect ongoing improvements throughout the calendar year. We are excited about the broader ongoing relationship with Samsung and are pleased to welcome the Samsung employees that have joined Seagate at our new Korean design center and in the sales organization.","With respect to our forecast for the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year, it is our belief that as a result of the structural damage to the supply chain, there is substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand. We believe that the exabyte demand is growing at 40% per year, while areal density growth is increasing at less than 25% per year. We continue to expect that calendar 2012 unit demand will exceed supply, that the exabyte shortage will be more pronounced than the unit shortage, and that price declines on a like-for-like basis will be relatively benign throughout the year. We believe the industry will likely exit the calendar year with approximately 100 exabytes of unmet demand.","Based on Seagate's average capacity per drive shipped last quarter, which was the highest in the industry, this exabyte shortfall equates to approximately 150 million units. For the March quarter, we are expecting drive shipments of at least 60 million units, revenues to be at least $4.3 billion, gross margins to exceed 33% and operating expenses of approximately $405 million. Based on share repurchases completed during the month of January, fully diluted share count used in the EPS calculation is expected to be 465 million shares.","For the June quarter, we expect that our supply chain capabilities will continue to improve, which will result in revenues of at least $5 billion and gross margins comparable to those expected for the March quarter. In light of the persistent supply-demand imbalances that we believe will exist throughout the calendar year, combined with greater visibility due to our LTAs, we currently expect a relatively benign pricing environment resulting in revenues of at least $20 billion for calendar year 2012.","With respect to the capital structure and our priorities for cash, we expect to continue our practice of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase throughout the calendar year 2012. To the extent market conditions allow, we expect to engage in share repurchases, which should result in a share count of approximately 350 million by the end of the calendar year.","Last week, the Seagate board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which adds to the approximately $900 million remaining from the December 2010 authorization. Additionally, the board approved a 39% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.25 per share. We believe these actions will help us maximize value for our shareholders and demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the business.","Melanie, we're now open -- ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions basically related to the same subject, which is mix. You mentioned that like-for-like pricing should be flattish in the quarter, but you didn't talk about the impact of platter density, I guess, improving as the year goes on. And also served market priorities going forward with regard to mix relative to branded, et cetera. Could you just sort of walk through what that means for pricing and gross margins?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I -- I mean, Pat. I mean, I think we did say that we basically expect pricing to be benign for like-for-like for the year. If average drive capacity increases, then that would imply an ASP increase. And that's a function really of our recovery on components, our ability to deliver higher and higher capacity, Steven. As you know in the last quarter, we were up about 5% quarter-over-quarter, which will probably be the high-water mark for the industry. And we hope to improve upon that moving forward as we get stronger supply on the component side to build some of the shortages that are particularly heavy in the business-critical area.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","And then just to follow up on that, is there any way to prioritize or let us in a little bit on your thinking about what you're going to prioritize in terms of the served markets going forward, how much you can put more into the branded market given these LTAs, et cetera?","Stephen J. Luczo","Again, the LTAs were -- the volume commitments made for the LTAs were made in consideration of the other markets that we have to serve, so as I pointed out, that's global distribution, that's our branded business and that's other OEM customers that don't have LTAs. So if you add all that up, it's obviously, it's in excess of what our capacity is. And so our ability to first address the market opportunities that our customers are presenting to us is the strategic decision Seagate's made, and the give for that was a commitment on behalf of the customers to engage with Seagate for 1 or more years. So we're going to obviously serve the retail channel as we can, but we're pretty heavily committed to our LTA customers and our global distribution partners.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Noble Financial.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Just want to clarify. You said there would be 150 million units of unmet demand. What -- is that by the end of the calendar year or the fiscal year?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, Mark. The way we're getting to that calculation is for the calendar year, we believe the growing exabyte demand will be about 100 exabytes. That might be more heavily weighted towards enterprise, both in nearline and mission-critical. And what we did is basically took our average capacity per drive to get to the 150 million units. So it's a calendar year statement, which basically means that we believe the impacts of the flooding are going to be felt well into 2013 in terms of trying to address the needs of customers to acquire storage.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","What would you project as the industry capacity in the September quarter?","Stephen J. Luczo","The September quarter of 2012?","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Stephen J. Luczo","Our industry's capacity? Well, the drive industry or the component industry? Because those are 2 different questions.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Well, what would be the pacing capacity?","Stephen J. Luczo","I think we still believe in the September quarter that it's probably going to be components. I think if you asked about drive capacity against the TAM, that's likely to be 180 million to 200 million unit TAM, will be below that, but I think that the component aspect of that will be even below the drive aspect.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","So no more than 190 million -- 180 million to 190 million for the available shipping capacity?","Stephen J. Luczo","No, what I said was less than that. I said the TAM, I believe, will be 180 million to 200 million, depending on what your view of Windows 8 is, which ours is pretty positive. The drive industry, I don't think, will get to those levels, and then the component constraints will be even below that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Steve, you talked about how you're doing a direct shipment to the OEMs in this environment. Is that in lieu of JIT hubs or are JIT hubs still included in that view? And then would you expect to go back to JIT hubs later in the year when supply gets better or do you think you can keep it this way, directly shipping to the customers or their manufacturing centers?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I'll let Dave answer the first part after I answer the second part, which is the customer behavior has clearly shifted as a result of what's happened to the supply chain. And if you think about it, it's not all bad. So for those customers that have been able to take advantage of the direct ship and then revenue that product fairly quickly, thereby avoiding kind of the inventory holding period that goes on in JIT hubs, they're going to be obviously advantaged to continue to do that, which would make me think that the competitors that aren't able to do that are going to have to address that pretty quickly. So as I said, we expect that these changes that are occurring in terms of better and quicker alignment between supply and demand, at the end of the day, are going to sustain themselves because certain companies are clearly using it to their advantage to take market share currently. Dave, do you want to add anything?","William David Mosley","No, Rich, I don't have a lot to add. We went through this transformation fairly quickly, and it's been fairly positively received as well, because people just wanted line of sight to the supply. I don't see that changing anytime in the near term, and we would have to discuss whether we change it in the future. But right now, with today's service models, I don't see it changing.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then from a technology perspective, the Samsung 500-gig  notebook drives have been pretty well received.  If they could have shipped more, it would have been even better received. You're keeping your 500-gig notebook plans in place. Is that a go-forward decision or is that just for the moment? Or can you just talk about the synergies between the roadmaps?","Stephen J. Luczo","Sure. The Samsung product is a 9.5-millimeter, 1-terabyte, 2-disk product primarily. It obviously can be less capacity to that. Our Singapore product is a 7-millimeter product, Rich, so it's really targeted as a drive for the ultrabook market.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then lastly, it seems a little silly to ask about inventory levels, but because there seems to be some confusion in the market, and I kind of need to do so, can you just talk about what you're seeing in U.S. inventory in the channel and then North American inventory and then what's out there in Asia?","Stephen J. Luczo","This -- I mean, Rocky, you want...","Albert A. Pimentel","Yes, Rich. We -- this is Rocky. We still see a pretty constant flow in the non-OEM channels, and certainly, the channel has been probably the -- suffering the most from the standpoint of availability of the drives, so we still see healthy demand and continuing flow. We don't see any inventory buildup at this point. In fact, as Steve mentioned on the -- on his prepared comments, we've had tremendous reception on our auction concept, because the non-OEM customers see it as a great way for them to access additional products, so all the anecdotal evidence is we still a pretty healthy channel flow.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. I think for us, Rich, where there might be inventory that's not moving as quickly as you might think given the magnitude of the shortages, those tend to be pretty low-capacity offerings, and Seagate was able to obviously bat [ph] half the mix down. So from our product perspective, we feel that the product we're putting into the channel is moving quite quickly.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And it's helpful to put out the $20 billion tough [ph] guidance, so that'll be fun tomorrow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citigroup.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to get a better sense of what's happening on pricing within the channel. I think there is some concern that channel pricing, which is still about 50% or 60% above pre-flood levels for Seagate, might come down pretty meaningfully downwards as supply actually moves closer to demand. I mean, can you give us a sense of what your expectations are for channel pricing for Seagate for the next 2 quarters?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, I mean, I think -- again, I think that we've been pretty articulate what we think pricing is going to be like overall for Seagate. I think you have to also look at what pricing was like for our competitors and us. I mean typically, Seagate would be $10 to $12 a unit ASP higher given our mix. In this quarter, it looks like we're $2 lower, which means, obviously, that disparity was probably across all channels but probably particularly evident in the distribution channel. So I don't think you should read into what other people might have to do in channel pricing what we have to do in channel pricing. We've tried to keep our pricing competitive in light of the constraints, but as I said also, leave it at levels where we don't have a lot of fluctuation to our gross margin. So in certain capacity points, pricing seems to have affected demand, and therefore, when you're running a portfolio as broad as ours, there's always opportunity to generate gross profit dollars that are a function of pricing and volume. But overall, I would not expect any drastic reduction in our pricing in any one of our go-to-market channels.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And for Pat, I wanted to get a better sense of your dividend policy. Obviously, you've increased it meaningfully last week. Do you have any targets in mind whether it be payout ratios or a minimum dividend yield? Is your plan to increase it consistently every year? Any color would be appreciated.","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","I don't know that we're quite viewing it as a payout ratio. Probably over as time evolves, as we go through this normalization, however you guys want to characterize it, but we look to returning a percentage of our cash flow as a payout ratio, not necessarily yield. And -- but this year, we just felt with the acceleration of the earnings model and the cash model that we got ahead of it as a combination of the share repurchase and the dividend increase as a balanced way to reward our shareholders and returning capital to them. So I would say it was a policy-driven thing as more as a relooking at our model for the next year, and we'll continue to assess that generally from year to year.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, I think, Joe, that the -- clearly, with our intent to reduce the share count, that allows us a lot of flexibility to increase dividend and not increase cash outlay. So we think they work hand in hand, and we're trying to be thoughtful in terms of the total cash flow that we expect the company to be able to generate over the next several years. What's that split between obviously returning first and foremost into our own business to drive our technical leadership, and then how do we return to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchase? And I think we've had -- we have a pretty good balance here and we're always open to suggestions. But as one of the few tech companies paying a dividend or one certainly that -- the few that pay at the yield we do, we certainly think we're striking a balance that shows our confidence in the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hunt with Auriga.","Kevin M. Hunt - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. First, I continue to get lots of questions on pushback on the long-term agreements, generally the pushback of the long lines of OEMs, and what are of those when push comes to shove a year from now? So maybe you could give us a little assurance on what are the mechanisms to ensure that they can't reneg on those? And the second question is really on the hybrid drive, if you could give a little more color on -- those all obviously have a big push from Intel coming late in the year, and what the positioning is there for you guys. And maybe what other -- what the competitors are at, at this point?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, on the LTAs, I guess I would start by saying if you don't think the CEOs of the companies that have signed these contracts are worth the signature on the paper, you may wonder if you should be owning any of their stocks either. These are firm contracts that are negotiated in terms of volume commitments and our commitment to supply, and they have conditions around them in terms of pricing and availability. And they're not contracts that you can decide 6 months from now that you really didn't want to enter into. I think the bigger point, which if anyone is not understanding, these contracts are extremely beneficial to our customers. They came about because customers that understood the implications of the supply chain disruption understood that access to this technology is going to be absolutely critical to deliver the solutions they're delivering. And while historically, maybe people look to say, \"How do I save $0.50 or $1 buying a disk drive?\" what people learned over the last 6 months is that by doing that, you're putting at risk, sometimes, anywhere to 10x to 12x that amount in revenue. So I mean, 1 million disk drives going to a customer is going to generate today even on the client $300 million or $400 million or $500 million or $600 million of revenue, depending on what your client base is. And on the enterprise, of course, the numbers are probably 10x that. So this is an opportunity, I think, for a lot of the customers to basically assure themselves that they have access to the product so they can then do their planning, and especially when it's against a big shortfall in demand.  I guess the analogy I use is if you lost 1\/3 of the oil production in the world and everyone realized what that meant in terms of availability to gas for your car or fuel for your home, and you happen to have a relationship with a station owner down the block that happened to have stations all over the world, and they offered you the ability to basically get fuel whenever you wanted to at competitive prices, would you view that as an advantage or a disadvantage? I think it's pretty clear it's an advantage. So we have a lot of confidence that these contracts will be adhered to. They are involving the highest level of executives at the companies that we engage with them. They are mutually beneficial, they are competitive and they're giving these companies a great capability to plan their businesses going forward. And in an environment like we said, where we believe there's going to be an exabyte shortage that could -- that goes into 2013. With respect to a hybrid technology, we -- as you know, we're on our second generation of hybrid technology moving into our third generation of hybrid technology, and we're quite confident that the performance and cost aspects of the devices that we'll be delivering over the summer will be best-in-class and basically will have SSD-quality performance with marginal cost adder [ph], so we believe this is a big category for us going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I had 2, if I could. Pat, is there any cash flow targets you could provide for the March quarter or more broadly for CY '12?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","I think we have a philosophy around our business of keeping enough cash free [ph] liquidity. I mean, we certainly have shown in the past that we can run that number as low as $800 million. But for our business, we look to keep $1 billion-plus of cash on the balance sheet, and then we generate at least $1 billion-plus of cash flow. So but that -- so looking at both aspects of the flow and what we'd like to have gross on the balance sheet.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So sorry if I misunderstood that, but how much free cash flow do you think you can -- if you're going to do $20 billion in revenues this year, how much free cash flow do you think you can spin off of that $20 billion?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Well, we can do -- I mean, you're talking about $1 billion a quarter, at least, so you could model that, but it's certainly north of $1 billion a quarter.","Stephen J. Luczo","I mean, you guys can model that. We've given you basically revenues and our view on at least pricing through -- margins through halfway through the year and pricing through the whole year, no big changes to OpEx...","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Or CapEx.","Stephen J. Luczo","Or CapEx. So you guys can work your own models.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Fair enough. And Steve, a follow-up for you, if I could. If you could talk a little bit about what you think industry TAM on supply of drives would be for the June quarter. And more specifically within that context, what do you think Samsung can do for Seagate over the next couple of quarters in terms of output of drives, please?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think June -- you have to start with March, right? I mean, at the end of the day, we're a manufacturing industry, and so you kind of have to think about June as a function of growth over March, which then makes you think about December. And don't worry, I won't take you back to 1957. So I think if you really think about December, the math lays out like this: the industry shipped 120 million units, but it only built 105 million. So I think the earlier forecast of the industry being able to ship something like 145 million for the March quarter would have been pretty spectacular in light of 105 million built, because you figure there's no inventory drawdowns that's going to occur in March, right? So you're talking about 105 million going to 145 million. I think that's a stretch. I mean, is it possible? I suppose if you mix way down in capacity, and you're only shooting for unit volume, it might theoretically be possible. But if you look at the first few weeks of production, it looks to us that the industry is on a pace to do something closer to 130 million, 135 million. You can therefore -- to me, 150 million to 160 million is probably the right number for June, again, depending on mix and recovery to the supply chain.","Unknown Executive","And components as well.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes.  Did that answer that question?","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It did, Steve. And then if you just don't mind, a little bit on Samsung, how do you think they can ramp?","Stephen J. Luczo","So Samsung's interesting. It's a great product. It's a high-yielding product. As you know, it's a outsourced manufacturing product currently for us with TDK, SA, Winpoint. And really, they ran into a situation where they were constrained by a component. And other than that, we would've been able to probably produce millions of those drives in the December quarter or they would've. In March, we probably would've been in the 10-plus million range. We've addressed the component shortage, we're ramping it quickly, and I think it's certainly reasonable that if you look over the course of the year that we can hit 50 million units a quarter with that product extending into the fall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit around the CapEx and how you're thinking about CapEx over the next few quarters, Steve, and what your thoughts are on maybe trying to add capacity at some point and how you're thinking about that in the context of the industry? And then secondly, on the gross margin side of things, given you've still been pretty constrained, obviously, on capacity, can you talk about the 33% gross margin that you're pointing to in the June quarter, approximately 33% in line with the March quarter? And then sort of how pricing and maybe mix and then the volume bouncing back to higher levels for your production would all play into that number?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, they all play into that number. You got it. Yes, more volume, relatively stable pricing environment, mix, again, kind of a function of meeting our customer demands. And you've got to remember that mix is a little different than it's probably been in the last several years where we get orders from customers and then we basically work with our supply chain to address mix. It's a little bit in reverse right now. We have our supply chain that's presenting a bunch of parts to us, and then we dynamically rework every 24 hours what we can build in order to best satisfy our customers' demand. So it's a little bit in reverse, and it won't be fully recovered by June. So there's still going to be a big influence in the June quarter that says, \"Here's what we can build and how do we best address the market?\" So I think it's really a September quarter, maybe exiting the June quarter where we're going to have the flexibility that you might normally think of a company like Seagate, where you could put an order in, sometime 8 weeks ahead of time, and we could probably respond to it with our supply chain. So that all plays into it, and that's why we believe there's going to be stability to our margins, at least for the next 6 months, and probably throughout the calendar year.  And what was the first part? Sorry, CapEx. I'll let Dave answer the CapEx. The general answer is right now, we're working against, if you will, a capital -- I mean, a productive capacity that's fixed, that's not fully utilized, obviously, because of supply chain disruption. And what we're doing right now is keeping our heads down to work towards getting fuller utilization of the assets that we have. We're also in product transitions, which require technology and capital to transition. But generically, there's not a plan to put capital at work to raise that ceiling. And we wouldn't plan on doing that unless we got to, let's say, the fall, and it was clear that the unit and exabyte shortages were even more pronounced and of a longer duration than what we're thinking, which is kind of through 2013 in various forms and function. You'd then be  into lead times where you probably would have to address increasing capital, and then we would obviously come back to our strategic customers and negotiate that commitment with some sort of extension to the various LTAs because we obviously don't want to be on the hook for putting a bunch of capital to work and then have excess capacity in the industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig Hallum.","Christian D. Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Is it safe for us to assume, because everyone's trying to figure out when all this ends, that the gross margin targets that you guys laid out before of 22% to 26% is a long-term target? Obviously, we're well above that. Do you see the world possibly settling out higher than that post Thailand issues?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. It's just, first of all, when all this ends, I mean, I think there's the -- the question when does all this end, which of course is the biggest question in life. But -- and then what does it look like? And the second biggest question in life. And what I think the answer is, it doesn't end. This is a structural event that's happened, and the industry has changed. And people want to get into the simplistic model of \"and then, on July 17, it's going to be just like it was, and there's pricing is going to come down and everybody's margin.\" I mean, this -- and that's just -- that's just not very sophisticated nor I think reflective of the business that we're in. And I think that what's going on right now is showing that. So I think it's a structural change and we've been saying this for a long, long time. This is structural. And what it looks like when we're through the transition -- and I would view the transition to mean, like I was saying before, when customers say \"Here's what we need,\" we can be very responsive with our supply chain and deliver commitments with what they need in very short order. That is at least 1 year out, I think, in terms of meeting the unmet demand.  So what does it look like then? It looks different, and it looks different probably forever. What does that mean in terms of business models and gross margins? I would say that it means higher than what was in place before, because by definition, what was in place before had too much risk in the model. I mean, at the end of the day, the reason the industry is going through what it's going through right now is because there was excess risk in the system. And that risk, in part, was a function of gross margins that weren't sustainable for what our industry really delivers, either in terms of productive capability or R&D and capital. So I believe when it's all said and done and partly, there's going to be more efficiencies, partly there's going to be more systems put in place. That supply availability is going to be more important than saving $0.50 on a disk drive. And if you ask any customer right now, would they rather have another million drives or would they rather save $0.50 a drive, they all will tell you, they want another million drives so they can go produce $400 million or $500 million in revenue. And I think that's what the smart strategic customers are focused on, and the smart strategic customers are the ones that are going to win.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First, a model question, and then kind of most of my questions have been answered, but a follow-up on the earlier question. First on the model, just real quickly, what tax rate are we to assume as we look out going forward?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Well, for the rest of this fiscal year, I was just planning on a 3% tax rate. In longer term, we've modeled closer to 5%. But as you follow our tax structure, obviously, it's -- I won't say fixed, because it's not fixed, but it's certainly, as we earn numbers in these ranges, it makes for a foreseeable low rate, so I'd used 3% for the rest of this year and 5% long term for the model.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to be clear, for the calendar or for -- you're talking fiscal year?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","3% for the remainder of the fiscal year and 5% for -- as a normal model going beyond that.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the areal density transition that you're talking about being pretty much completed through over the next 6 months, can you remind us again how that flows to the gross margin line in what looks to be a stable pricing environment, how we should think about that on a per unit cost basis?","William David Mosley","Well, we'd never characterize it per unit but obviously, if you take -- you think about it from the construct of if you're taking a 500 per platter notebook, you're taking a disk in the head out. And so if you're talking the range of historically, we take out anywhere from $4 to $8 on a transition for a standard platform, obviously, that's our leverage, that's our way we look at it, and that's what we're calculating. But as Steve talked about in his prepared comments, we're largely done with the rest of the portfolio, and now we're going to have -- as we ramp those, we'll continue to get savings but we've done a -- last quarter, done a great job of pulling that forward. So that's sort of already baked into the financials, but I think what we'll get in our financials is much more capital and efficiency utilization as the factories ramp.","Stephen J. Luczo","And I think what's interesting is the transition for the industry. If you asked that question 5 years ago, you would say that you have compressed margins at the front end of that transition just because you're putting a lot of capital to work in new equipment and yields are low, and then you kind of get this margin expansion that might last 4 or 5 quarters, depending on what's going on competitive with that particular product. And then you start getting some margin pressure the back end of that cycle. I think it's a little different now. You still are thinking of obviously all the issues on the front end. And in fact, it may be a little longer and tougher just because the technology is getting tougher in terms of these transitions. But I think the big difference is once you get the margin expansion, and again, when that starts to come down is a function of competitiveness, I do think that you're getting longer tails on margins just because people are driving yields a lot higher. Our industry historically would've said, \"Hey, if you get to the low 80s or mid- low 90s\" -- sorry, \"mid-80s to high 80s to low 90s on yields, then you kind of start thinking about the next product.\" And that's -- it's just a different world now with these capacity points staying in production longer and what's going on competitively, we can drive yields higher than that for longer periods of time, which might give us a little longer tail on the margin, so we'll see. It's -- I think, it's kind of a new phase of the industry right now.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And final thing for me. Do we exit the calendar year based on what you guys have said, at 80 million per quarter in production capacity?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. I mean it's your model, but I wouldn't -- I don't -- it doesn't sound too far off, depending on mix. Depending on mix. But yes, I mean, it's about right.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess, Steve, could you make any comments around what to expect on the, I guess, from the efficiencies gained from Samsung on OpEx as you move forward? I guess, what's going on right now with margins is a lot is sort of -- is probably covered up with what's going on with pricing, but you made a comment earlier, or Pat did, about not much going on with OpEx as you move through the year.","Stephen J. Luczo","Right.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","So is --  yes, is that kind of partially impacted by the Samsung integration? And then if you can make any comments about like a longer-term Samsung OpEx framework, that'd be helpful.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes. No, it's a great question and I'm glad you asked it. I mean, I don't -- we don't have a number for you yet. Maybe by next quarter we can start gauging that for you. Although, of course, as we go through time obviously, it's all Seagate. But what I will tell you, because I think you hit on a good point, is that we will learn a lot in terms of better operating models from what we've acquired at Samsung. They took a different design approach, they took a different qual approach and they took a different manufacturing approach. And there's a lot of good stuff there that we're learning that, as it turns out, we can apply to our broader portfolio, whether or not, again, that has to do with how we qual the product, how we ramp it or even how we build it. And they do a great job. The yields are very high. They run very clean factories. And at the end of the day, I think that, that's going to benefit us in terms of our operating efficiency, i.e. lower cost of goods sold for any product made. And it should have an impact that helps us throughout a product line. And I think probably by next quarter, we can maybe start scoping what we think some of that benefit is. You hit another point that pricing kind of masks what's going on. Well, it does and it doesn't. Like I said, you can see what our margins are at with price increases that were a lot lower than our competition. We're making really good progress on our cost and our yields, and we're getting through some of these transitions that are challenging. But like I said, once you get through them, then you basically have a pretty nice product to build for a while. And at these capacity points, when you're at nice round numbers like 1 and 2 terabytes and 500 gigabytes, we think these products are going to be in production for a while, so we have to be able to make them at very high yields.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up, if I could. Is there any point in the second half of the year when you think that you'll actually be able to ship the mix, I guess mix-appropriate, for what customers are wanting, and then, really, at that point, it's just a matter of being able to ship enough of the right mix?","Stephen J. Luczo","I'll let Dave answer the question. I think it's going to be a struggle for a while. Business-critical has been really impacted quite heavily. Mission-critical probably recovers first because there's so much effort by the industry to solve that problem, and it's a relatively lower volume. Of course, you have substantial growth in the nearline business-critical space as a result of cloud computing. So not only was that segment hit the hardest, it's also the one where there's just very significant growth opportunities. Then notebook probably and then desktop. So I think it's going to be a while. Dave, you want to add a little more color?","William David Mosley","I think there are some customer systems that are qualified. Different applications require high-capacity drives, so I think that'll still be unmet for quite a while. So the answer to your question directly is no. I believe that we'll still be mixed down through the balance of the year.","Stephen J. Luczo","Okay, I want to thank everyone on the call today, and I'd like to also stress my admiration for Seagate's customers, partners, suppliers, our employees and the rest of our industry for the hard work and perseverance through these very trying times.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks Kate. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. In addition to my usual commentary I have extended the prepared remarks for today's call and I have asked the management team to cover a few aspects of our business as it relates to the March quarter and the position of the company moving forward. We will discuss some of the actions we are taking to align with near-term market realities and to improve the company's profitability and cash flow. ","First I will cover the high-year level trends I have seen from customers and provide information as the direction we will be taking with the company with respect structure and focus. Dave Morton will then walk through certain financial metrics. Kate Mosley will cover the HDD business particularly with respect to our revolving product portfolio and our close recalls our guidance for the June quarter and our general expectations for the second half of calendar 2016. ","For the March quarter Seagate achieved revenues of $2.6 billion and a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 23%, net income of $66 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.22. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter were $39 million reflecting cost controls on lower variable compensation. Overall inventory levels were down 11% sequentially and ended at the lowest cost of finished goods excluding the flood since June 2010. ","Capital Expenditures of $95 million were in line with our expectations. We believe Seagate's March quarter results are reflective of a generally weak macroeconomic environment as well as accelerating usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Our HDD shipments for the March quarter were $39.2 million units and 55.6 Exabyte's reflecting a seasonally lower than expected overall. In the March quarter we initiated targeted pricing increases across our product line.","And we were successful in some areas and unsuccessful in other. We continue to believe the industry needs a stable pricing environment to deliver the higher level of requirements being placed on our products and to realize the value we are providing to the market. As a result we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy that reduces and properly reflects the investment in technology the market requires. ","We experienced particular weakness in the client desktop as well as the enterprise legacy markets, adding strength in the enterprise cloud markets. Overall average capacity per drive was 1.4 Terabytes up 30% year-over-year and within this near line cloud average capacity per cloud was 3.9 Terabytes up 25% year-over-year. ","On a year-over-year basis unit shipments were down 22% while the Exabyte's shipped were up 2%. The decrease in the unit temp in our markets percent challenges for Seagate that will requires alignment to operational preference and pressures the overall HDD supply chain. Especially for suppliers that are supplying one part per drive. However, we are encouraged by the trend towards significantly higher average capacity per rive applications which result in great absorption and heads this in favor HDD storage device now and in the foreseeable future in terms of costs as a function of required performance. ","The continued advancement and adaptation of mobile and cloud based computing architectures is reflected in the revenue shifts we are seeing in our portfolio. Our long term business thesis continues to be that there will be a significant transition in the HDD from a historical split. Revenue split of 60% client and 40% enterprise revenue to 40% client and 60% enterprise revenue over the next several years. ","We also expect that the average capacity per drive will increase in all markets. Most important to our product positioning and related investments is not just the mix between client enterprise and the mix shift within these markets. In the client's base, we expect to continue decline in PC shipments that we anticipate to moderate in the next year. PC HDDs now represent about 56% of Seagate client revenue and approximately 30% of total company revenue. ","While overall PC HDD client revenues is declining the remaining share is dominated by high capacity products which will continue to increase with the new product offerings that we have started to introduce in the June quarter. we are starting to see our client business shift to consumer, surveillance, gaming and DVR markets which are all high capacity user environments which I believe over the next several quarters this growth will result in these combined markets being greater than the traditional PC compute market today. ","As an example our consumer business revenues as a percentage of total client revenues have grown 6% in the last 12 months whereas PC revenue as a percentage of total client revenues has declined 6%. This is consistent with our belief that reducing the amount of storage on certain client devices propagated to another location. In the enterprise market, revenue mix continues to trend from the legacy mission critical to near line car market. ","In the March quarter we experienced unexpected weakness for a legacy mission critical HDDs which were approximately 700,000 units below our forecast. While it's difficult to attribute the enterprise mission critical between macroeconomic factors and architectural shifts we expect further declines in the mission critical markets in June quarter and then decline should moderate over the quarters thereafter. ","This mission critical weakness in the March quarter was offset by near line cloud upside demand of more than 500,000 units over which we could only deliver 350,000 additional units due to the long wait time as required to fulfill demand. Importantly in the March quarter the average capacity per drive for the mission critical HDDs that came out of our forecast versus the average capacity of ATB to 8 Terabytes of near line HDD outside the demand we saw reflected the shifts in Exabyte's of almost 6:1. ","Demand signals from our near line customers has improved over the last few weeks and we are planning for our fourth consecutive quarter of high demand for HR Byte portfolio and initial volume shipments our 10 Terabyte Helium HDD product. As a result of these trends as well as input from our major cloud customers we believe that these shifts from legacy to cloud for enterprise applications has accelerated in the last 6 months and is now complementing the cloud storage generated by consumer applications. ","As we managed the shifts in our product portfolio demand and changing the nature of our customer base we are aligning the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing preference and we are reducing our capital expenditure to maintenance capital requirement levels. Through these actions Seagate will be operating at very near full capacity in our operating capacity to our shift in chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. ","In the March quarter we began the process of reducing our HDD manufacturing capacity from approximately $55 million to $60 million drives per quarter to approximately $35 million to $40 million drives per quarter. The actions required will be completed within the next 6 to 9 months. At the same time we are continue to accelerate the utilization of our own drive factories internal head and media facilities. ","For fiscal 2016 total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $535 million down approximately 28% over fiscal year 2015. For fiscal year 2017 assuming current outlook on demand we are targeting an additional reduction in spending reflecting a very low maintenance capital plan of approximately $400 million. In addition we will continue operating expense management across the company that aligns with the market trends. ","We believe that given the shifts in our product revenues above as well as recognizing the full impact in our management changes and our manufacturing footprint and operating expenses, the company will see revenue growth, product gross margin improvements and improved profitability assuming relatively stable macro environment.","Dave Morton and Dave Mosley will go into more details on these activities and I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now. ","Dave Morton ","Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business there a few specific areas in our financial model that were impacted in Q3. I would like to provide details in these conditions to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion around the actions we are taking manufacturing and operating expense levels. ","For the March quarter the addressable HDD and cloud storage systems markets were lower than forecast impacting our revenue results for the quarter. Within this there were specific HDD product areas where demand fell short of our expectations including traditional mission critical HDD enterprise products and desktop client's products in China. In addition we made strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low capacity notebook market. ","In our systems in Silicon business we experienced weaker than expected demands across most of the product lines. The lowered and forecasted HDD demand impacted our production levels and increased our factory absorption costs. We also aggressively managed our finished goods in the quarter and improved our inventory levels by approximately a $180 million. This reduction in inventory negatively impacted our factory utilization. ","Combined these factors were the primary reasons that our product gross margins declining approximately 290 basis points sequentially to approximately 23% with 80 basis points impact from the HDD revenue shortfall, 70 basis points from the systems and silicon business revenue shortfall and 140 basis points from factory underutilization. While we are disappointed we did not anticipate the weaker demand in the March quarter. The company is evaluating and implementing a variety of actions to reduce the company's cost structure which will result in financial improvements over the next level months. ","Towards our infrastructure cost alignments and fiscal Q3 alone we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $90 million in onetime restructuring charges right off of certain fixed assets, certain terminated contracts and discontinued inventory. We are currently sizing future non-reoccurring restructuring cash charges that we are estimating will be approximately $150 million over the next several quarters. We anticipate having more detailed actions identified within 60 days and we will expect that the financial benefits of these actions will begin to have a positive impact in the September quarter with the full benefit occurring in calendar 2017. ","As we formalize the specific actions and timing of cost savings we will continue to provide updates to this framework. While we are formulating all of the actions we will take to address gross margins and operating profits, we believe the overall cost of alignment activities we will implement will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business with the goal of achieving a minimum of $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share in calendar 2017. ","For the March quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $439 million slightly lower than forecasted. Looking ahead our expenses in the June quarter will be relatively flat with additional cost reductions in plan for FY 2017. Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $205 million and free cash flow was a $110 million. Fiscal year today we have generated $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 298 million shares outstanding. ","Our debt structure and level of interest expense s manageable. As announced today the board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63. There has been no change in the dividend policy and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is recorded by our cash flow generation forecast albeit at a higher payout ratio than previously stated as our objective. ","I will turn over the call to Dave Mosley to cover our HDD business in more detail. ","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Dave. Beginning with the near line product lines are 8 Terabyte business critical products continues aggressive volume ramp and we have been essentially sold out for the month of March and April. We have had over 200% volume growth of 8 Terabyte in the March quarter and we anticipate continued growth in the June quarter. In addition our 10 Terabyte product lines shipped a large volume of qualification units in the March quarter and our volume growth is accelerating in the June quarter as well. ","We believe our 10 Terabyte product to be leading in all performance and power metrics and we are very happy with the feedback from our customers and our qualifications. In the client space as Steve sad the PC market continued to decline in Q3 and we began end of life activity on some of the older 500 Gigabyte and below products that have very low margins. Most of the margin cost benefits of these products will be realized over the next few quarters. ","In the March quarter we began the ramp of our 1 Terabyte and 2 Terabyte 7 mm 2.5 inch product line for our consumer notebook and DVR customers. This new product line allows us to address the target markets with lower costs and improved value proposition for our customers. Qualifications have gone well with customer interest high and we anticipate shipping several million units in the June quarter. ","Initially the product will be a consumer offering moving to OEM offering in September and December and we believe we will competitive technology through the end of the calendar year. We are also accelerating the application of these same technologies into our lines for surveillance as DVR at the end of the calendar year. ","The mission critical market served by our 10,000 and 15,000 RPM products has been declining over the last few quarters and we have seen traditional trends of approximately 8 million to 8.5 million units per quarter decline to approximately 6.5 million to 7 million units in the March quarter. Within the mission critical market approximately 25% of the volumes are 15,000 RPM HDDs. This is the primary area where we are seeing a shift in low end servers to lower capacity flash SSDs and we expect it to continue. ","In 10,000 RPM HDD there has been some technology shift happening as well however we believe that market will have a much longer transition horizon. Our goal over the coming months is to manage our forecasting conservatively with mission critical TAM decline in the June quarter potentially leveling to modest decline in the back half of the years. Over the long term we believe the technology shifts in the market will report our complimentary investment thesis of flash ware performance and driving HDD for architecture. ","Shifting our HDD build volumes to our higher capacity offerings will allow us to simplify our wafer requirements and optimize our product portfolio which will not need further product refreshes for some time. Improved utilization of our own factories properly for the market demand will improve our costs considerably. We realize our non-depreciation related fixed costs are high competitively and also too high for current demands. ","These cost items will be addressed sooner than those related to the manufacturing footprint. There are also mini costs related to the product transitions that while temporarily driving a higher cost profile will also us to improve our cost footprint in FY 2017. With respect to the shift of the higher capacity products we do need to be mindful of longer lead times and supply chain management for these products. By engaging directly with the broader customer base and establishing deeper channel partnerships we believe we will improve our sales operation efficiency and forecast. ","Thanks now I will turn the call back over to Steve. ","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Dave. Given the recent published earning results and the related conservative guidance from a broad base of large corporations that serve the global technology and industrial markets we are planning for season declines and revenue in June quarter for most of the markets we serve with the exception of near line markets. ","Based on these factors as well as our decision of not to participate in the GPC client market we expect to achieve revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in the June quarter with relatively flat gross margins and operating expenses. We continue to expect the demand in the second half of calendar year 2016 will be stronger than the first half with positive seasonal trends and continued growth in near line demand offset somewhat by macro-economic pressures. With this anticipated revenue growth as well as the actions we are taking to align our manufacturing footprint our operating expense, gross margins and profitability will improve in the second half of 2016. ","Should there be improvements in the macro economic conditions we should expect to see HDD unit across all markets with commensurate benefits to the company's performance. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we can now open it up for questions and answers. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham & Company. Your line is open. ","Rich Kugele","Thank you, good morning, in terms of the restructuring Steve you talked about getting to something around $2.50 should we assume something revenue wise lower first before it can start to grow again as you realign those lines, $35 million to $40 million units of capacity, you would assume you are probably exiting quite a few categories?","Steve Luczo","I think the capacity issue also relates to the amount of outsourced drives we have Rich, so in the second half of the year we expect revenue growth for the guide for June and we would expect that to continue through 2017 so the adjustments manufacturing of where we taking our internal capacity which was under absorbed and taking production inside which was basically additional under absorption but that was the non-operating fix costs or the cost of the factories themselves so there is a double effect of what happens once we bring the drives in as well to reduce our overall footprint. ","But we would expect to counter your 2017 revenues other than seasonal decline from December to March should continue to grow assuming the macro condition is stable in part because the portfolio also gets a lot stronger with the 1 TB and 2.5 and the 2 TB which are then products which are highly competitive and we believe at least six months ahead of the competition and capacity better much more relevant to us than the clients base. ","Rich Kugele","Okay. And then just to understand the difference from moving from mission critical to high capacity can you just expand the gross margin dollar impact and the technology, investments required to go and do that. Is it similar R&D investments, any thoughts about that?","Steve Luczo","Let me just give a general trend and then you can talk about the R&D side. In general the gross profit dollars is the same which is why losing 700,000 units but picking up 350,000 the gross margin percentages are about the same and once you reach the crossover point where we can either meet the upside demand or naturally exceed or whatever erosion continues in mission critical and like I said, its' really hard to understanding mission critical right now, is it being driven by macro or flashes or certain segments of that. ","And maybe the macros even accelerating the incursion of flash, it doesn't really matter; it's not going to reverse itself so we are preparing for the continued decline of the 15K segment. But as Dave indicated the 10K segment from our customer input will remain intact for a number of quarters if not for a number of years. I think it's more about managing the investment in the portfolio forward and then obviously again adjusting the manufacturing footprint so you are keeping pace and are a little bit ahead of the decline so all sold out versus having excess capacity. Dave will talk to you in more detail","Dave Morton","From a R&D perspective Rich it's fairly applicable you can move the technologies where it's headed, media technology is over at the money market segment. Other as Steve commented and I won't elaborate too much. The speed of the shift last quarter was really high demand with the cloud product and the following demand for the mission critical price were more a factory reaction than time issue anything. ","Rich Kugele","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","SherriScribner","Thank you. The cash flow number came in a little bit this quarter obviously with gross margins coming down. I wanted to get your sense about how your thinking your uses of cash going forward, how will the cash cost related to some of these restructuring actions impact you, are you still committed to the dividend, is there a plan to buy back shares considering shares have come back and do you have plans to buy back any of your debt which is trading at a discount to par?","Dave Mosley","Hi Sherri, this is Dave. As we think about heading back into the year. Obviously first and foremost we are going to invest in business ourselves. As we stated and looked around these onetime costs, restructuring cash charge specifically around the $150 million, we think that is very manageable over a generation and what we are able to yield here again over the next 6 month to 9 months and then as far as the dividend we think that is well manageable albeit at the higher end of those payout ratios and obviously up to the board of directors. With that said we feel that the very defendable against what we are able to generate moving forward. ","Steve Luczo","I think in the near future Sherri meaning the next 6 months to 12 months the consideration clearly go invest in the business because we do feel we have technology and product leads as long as the macro environment stays like it is with the product execution. We feel pretty good about the company's position competitively. And then in terms of what we will do with the cash flow, I think defending the dividend is the first we would do and would certainly like to keep the dividend level where it is. ","Initially obviously where the payout ratios are involved 30% and 50% as we had indicated but if the company is growing into that and improving revenues and margins, certainly we will put the company in position where the board has easier decision to make or the other way around. I think in terms of buy backs whether it's debt or equity, for the near term we will probably not reduce the cash or probably if there is excess cash we would keep it on the balance sheet, just in case the macro situation turns on us as we had more confidence about 2017 outlook.","And again the success of our products, we would evaluate that in terms of best use of it beyond dividend or going on balance sheet. ","SherriScribner","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open. ","AaronRakers","Thank you for taking the questions. Steve I was curious in past you have talked about returning to the 27% plus gross margin or the analyst they even talked about 27% or 32% on top of that you talked about 13% to 15% operating expense derivative. Understand there are a lot of things going on and realignments, when are you able to give back into that target model at this point?","Steve Luczo","Yes, we talked about was it worth guessing right now to provide you some guidance on that and I think I would prefer just for us to get through this next 60 days of really understanding to the changes we are going to be making to the operational footprint and investments because the reality is depending upon which decisions we make there is different timing. Some of the things we can get after right away is mostly mentioned but others are really a function of product transitions, customer call issue, regulatory issues etcetera so I think this is probably not worth guessing at this point and as we get more clarity on that specific actions we will get back to you. ","The question is do we still get back in that range in a reasonable period of time the answer is yes, we can get ourselves back into the range. But we want to just get little more work done before we give you an idea of when that's going to happen in this quarter. We rather do a little more work before we lay that out for you. ","AaronRakers","And Steve what gives you confidence that the mission critical business declined to the June quarter but then seems to stabilize into the back half of the year and going forward. It seems that there's not that much visibility there given the moving parts of macro and obviously the element of flash. ","Steve Luczo","Yes our feeling based on customer input was that the economics mostly talking to the application shift Aaron so the macro stuff I am not going to speculate on, if it gets worse than obviously all these markets will be under pressure. If it gets better all get a little bit reprieve. ","But it feels like the trend of where mission critical 15K is being taken out the point of exposure in 10K is in for now, maybe not for a while based on customer effects. So, our point is that as the transition to some point stabilizes and this probably happens in the second half of the calendar year. ","AaronRakers","Okay. ","Steve Luczo","Great. Everyone, thanks for taking the time today. And we look forward to talking next quarter and thanks for all your support as well to our customers and suppliers and most importantly our employees. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in todays' program. This concludes today's program and you can disconnect.

For today\u2019s call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I\u2019ll close the call with our outlook for the December quarter.","For the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28.6%, net income of $167 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.55. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29.5%, net income of $299 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.99, up 85% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $592 million.","We believe Seagate\u2019s September quarter reflects \u2013 results are reflective of a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment, as well as acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. Demand from cloud service providers for our nearline high capacity portfolio was stronger than we expected going into the September quarter.","HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were up approximately 20% year-over-year, with consecutive record shipments. We shipped 66.7 exabytes of storage in the September quarter. HDD unit shipments were 38.9 million units, with average capacity per drive at a record 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 44% year-over-year and reflecting our tenth quarter of sequential growth in capacity per drive. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the September quarter.","Our customers continue to benefit from our portfolio advancements, and we believe that Seagate is in the leading competitive position as our market shifts from a low capacity unit space demand profile to the future applications which are component rich and require aggressive technology advancement. This is particularly important as the storage market shifts from client server to mobile cloud applications and storage environments.","With respect to our Cloud Systems business, we are on track to launch new converged storage platforms including hybrid and all flash array offerings later this fiscal year, which we believe are equal to or better than our competition and we expect to see continued revenue growth for this business in the December quarter.","We are pleased with Seagate\u2019s execution in the September quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions.","I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on these activities.","Dave Morton","Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate\u2019s business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the September quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve\u2019s earlier discussion.","For the September quarter, Seagate\u2019s addressable HDD market was higher than forecast, driving benefit in our revenue and margin results for the quarter. Within this, there were specific HDD product areas where demand was stronger than our expectations, specifically for our nearline enterprise HDD products. Our ATB nearline enterprise products continues to be our leading revenue SKU, as overall HDD enterprise revenue was 41% of total consolidated revenue.","By comparison, our PC client shipments were 24% of total consolidated revenue in the September quarter, reflecting the shift of client server storage environments and our competitive positioning in the higher capacity segments.","From a market demand perspective, we continued to make strategic decisions to not aggressively participate in certain areas of the low capacity client market where the gross margin contribution does not warrant the long-term manufacturing investment. As a result, our future forecast for Seagate\u2019s HDD unit addressable market may have a variance to our competition, and our unit shipment market share may vary as we may not participate in all HDD unit sales demand in any given quarter.","Operating expenses for the September quarter were $580 million on a GAAP basis and $472 million on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential increase in our operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense related to the upside in our financial performance.","During the September quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $82 million in pretax restructuring charges. We continue to drive our non-variable compensation operating expense reduction activities, and our overall expenses will decline on a run rate basis as planned as we move through the fiscal year.","Capital expenditures amounted to $140 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital, supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment, and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the planned manufacturing footprint reductions across many sites.","As we manage the shifts in our product portfolio, customer demand, and changing nature of our customer base, we are on track to align the operating model of our HDD business to optimize our manufacturing footprint. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue over the next fiscal year and through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate will be operating at or very near full capacity.","Our operating philosophy will then shift to chasing demand upside versus managing excess capacity. While we are still in process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high capacity and cost advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year of 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the midpoint of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY2017.","Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $592 million, and free cash flow was $452 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $299 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense.","For capital allocation in the September quarter, we participated in a third-party block trade transaction in conjunction with ValueAct Capital and deployed $100 million for the redemption of 3 million shares. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our Board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, payable on January 4. There has been no change to our dividend policy, and our dividend payout of $188 million a quarter is supported by our cash flow generation forecast.","I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Dave. As indicated, demand for our high capacity nearline drives has accelerated from earlier in the year as cloud service providers are deploying new systems and\/or replacing HDDs that are in service. For the December quarter we expect this demand to remain stable, with overall market exabyte demand to be slightly stronger. We will maintain our focus on high capacity opportunities for our portfolio. As such, we expect relatively flat revenue with improvement in gross margins in the December quarter, and as previously discussed, non-variable compensation operating expenses will trend down sequentially.","We recognize the continued shift from cloud server to mobile cloud and the related infrastructure and application level changes taking place in our industry. These shifts are impacting our traditional product offering and customer base and are creating significant opportunities for core technology providers such as Seagate with an expanding customer base and higher value-add opportunities. The new customer base includes our traditional OEMs and distribution customers as well as significant and growing demand from cloud service providers, surveillance companies, and will likely include corporate demand in the not too distant future.","Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we can now open the call up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning. Just first off, I was curious, given how demand is coming in a little bit better than when you sort of started on this rationalization program, has there been any unintentional consequences in how you are dealing with customers or the supply chain that maybe adjusted the strategy going forward a little bit? And if not, can you sort of talk about how the mix maybe improves further like over a 12-month period from here? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I\u2019m not sure I understand the question, Steven. You want to provide me a little more detail on what you mean by unexpected consequences?","Steven Fox","Yes. Basically is component supply getting tighter than you would have thought just three or six months ago when you sort of set out on this plan? Plan accounts seem to be going up.","Steve Luczo","No. I mean, not than what we expected. I mean, again, our strategy was to take out the capacity that was mostly related to old technology on single disc two head because we\u2019re ramping new technology on single disc two head. And we\u2019re allocating our component technology across our portfolio, I think pretty effectively. We\u2019re balancing between the demands on 2, 4, 6, terabyte as well as the strong demand at 8 terabyte. So I think the factories are \u2013 they\u2019re all running hot, but that wasn\u2019t unexpected. So I think at the component level we\u2019re definitely at capacity, which the operations people like as they love kind of chasing upsides and running linearly every month of the quarter. So it was the operational goal that we had in mind when we made the manufacturing adjustments that we made.","Steven Fox","Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, just in reference to your nearline demand trend chart, Slide 8, there\u2019s been periods where that has sort of paused sequentially and gone down, I guess mainly related to cloud demand. Can you talk about your expectations for maybe another sort of pullback based on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of data center spend over the next few quarters? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","No. What we pointed out is what we think the demand is for the December quarter, which it looks like it\u2019s going to remain strong. But as you pointed out, the data center growth can have ebbs and flows and they don\u2019t really kind of project out more than a few quarters. And even if they do, the accuracy that they have in that projection is not fantastic. Sometimes they say they\u2019re going to slow down and some big corporation decides to shift to cloud and sometimes they get utilization freeze up. Sometimes a particular customer; we\u2019re strong and may win or lose a big piece of business which then either creates an opportunity or they delay buying.","It\u2019s still I think fairly dynamic with an overall trend that they continue to absorb a massive amount of storage as indicated by the record exabyte shipment that we\u2019ve now delivered two quarters in a row. So I think it\u2019s not going to be perfect quarter to quarter, but I think the 12-month over 12-month trends will continue to be quite favorable as they have been for the last few years as we\u2019ve started this shift to cloud.","Steven Fox","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.","Steve Luczo","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thank you. I appreciate the long-term gross margin guidance in the middle of the range for the full year. Just thinking about the gross margin upside this quarter, how much of that was from mixed versus the cost cutting actions that you\u2019ve been taking? Because it seems to me that with more cost cutting to come and some rationalization in December, we should maybe be able to get some margins up into the 30% range, so wanted to see what you thought about that, and also the mix between cost cutting and mix. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Yes, I don\u2019t really can presume that much, Sherri, I mean the mix was part of the cost cutting, in reference to the prior answer. When we made our operational adjustments it was to drive a higher capacity offering because of our technical lead. That\u2019s the right place for us to be at. We\u2019ll even see that on the client space. Again, it given where we\u2019re at in terms of 1 terabyte per disc notebook and 2 terabyte on desktop transition, we\u2019re going to get a mix advantage even within that space. So again, it\u2019s kind of all related to where we are technically, and as we ramp these products what we think our opportunity is competitively.","In terms of your second comment, we posted 29.5% and we said slight improvement, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s at odds with what you just concluded.","Sherri Scribner","Okay, great. And then just thinking about the calendar guidance that I think some of us were hoping for an update on this quarter, I mean if you look at the run rate, if you look at the margins, you can easily do $3.50 for calendar 2017. I think some people are thinking $4. Can you maybe give us some thoughts on your calendar expectation? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Yes. I think Dave gave most of the pieces of it and what we\u2019re thinking for revenue. We\u2019re not going to stay in the business of a calendar projection. We did that when people thought we were going out of business three months ago. But because we did say we\u2019d given update, I think the missing piece to do the model you want to do is where do we think revenues are going to come in.","Right now I would say that we feel that there\u2019s going to be revenue growth year-over-year and it\u2019s probably going to be in the mid-single digits, maybe mid-to-high single digits. That would imply, as you point out, beating that number by 40% to 50% with some head room. So if you landed in the $3.75 to $4 range I think that\u2019s probably right, given what we can see today. But I think the good news is margins near the midpoint of the range, operating margins probably a year ahead of where we thought we were going to be, and revenue growth, which I think we\u2019re feeling more confident that on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re going to see the revenue growth as well.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong progress, by the way.","Steve Luczo","Thank you.","Ananda Baruah","Yes, you\u2019re welcome. You guys must feel great about that. I guess really a quick clarification and then two from me, which are quick and related. Dave made mention of running a full capacity. I couldn\u2019t get if you guys were already essentially there, and I thought he said something about as you go through these initiatives. So would love any context around are you there now. And then I guess the question, Steve, quickly just on the exabytes, is I would love to get your view on what you see as sort of next 12 months to 24 months, sort of exabyte growth range, any context would be helpful. Seems like there\u2019s been an alteration. I know the comps have been easier. But it feels like there is \u2013 through our last two Qs maybe a little bit more high cast demand than you guys thought \u2013 well than the industry had been seeing previously.","And then the final thing is to your comment about \u2013 collectively you guys comments about being positioned to chase demand, if you can position as you want kind of exiting this, what are the implications of chasing demand and being at basically full capacity utilization? Does it alter the context of the contract conversation? Are there capital implications from that, CapEx implications from that? Anything like that would be helpful. I know that\u2019s a bunch. Thanks, appreciate it.","Steve Luczo","Well. Are we at capacity? As you know, in our business you only need to be at capacity on one element and you\u2019re technically at capacity. So yes, we\u2019re pretty much at capacity. But you got to remember, we\u2019re at capacity with a portfolio that\u2019s just rolling into a lot of new products. So the yield improvement potential is fairly significant. And then how we use that yield improvement in terms of where we use those extra heads and just gets very interesting as well. So where does the biggest marginal contribution occur as we free up capacity, whether or not it\u2019s head related or disc related or test related? So yes, we\u2019re at capacity, but it\u2019s \u2013 this is an extremely dynamic business that as you improve yield, you get more capacity, but as you get more capacity you may then decide to use that in more drives that have more heads and discs. So we\u2019re running the business the way we want to.","Let me skip to your third question because they\u2019re related, as you pointed out. What that means is that when we scope a business to, quote, do 40 million units per quarter, then what we go do is we task the ops team to go figure out how in the same footprint and same capital budget how to get to 50 million. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply more capital per se. I think more capital would only be a function of was there some significant market opportunity; whether or not that was a spike in demand or a product opportunity from a technical leadership, which would then obviously be reflected in greater revenue growth or expanding gross margin."," So we don\u2019t see any big change in where we run our business, and as you probably can tell we\u2019ve been really lean on capital and we\u2019ll continue to do so, even though we\u2019ve had some fairly significant one-time capital events like what we\u2019re doing in our factories to prepare for the consolidation that we identified. Exabyte growth, again, I think it\u2019s just really important for everyone, whether or not it\u2019s an analyst or an investor, to understand that the exabyte growth feels like it\u2019s going to continue in this kind of 20% to 35% range on an annual basis, but that doesn\u2019t mean every year quarter-over-quarter it\u2019s going to go up 20%. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve witnessed and that\u2019s \u2013 as I said before, it\u2019s going to be like this until we get more diversification of the cloud service providers or as corporations start to deploy cloud like architectures that are using these super high capacity drives.","So whether or not you ask me for the next year or two years or 24 months or 18 months, my answer\u2019s kind of the same. It feels to us that the demand is going to continue for utilizing HDDs in the very highest capacity environments, and those are \u2013 that\u2019s a great trend for us because it\u2019s absorbing more heads and discs. It\u2019s a way more complicated channel. It\u2019s a way more complicated test, manufacturing tolerances are much more difficult and all of that translates into a product that has a lot higher value add. So we don\u2019t see any shift to that fundamental thesis.","Ananda Baruah","Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of\u2026","Steve Luczo","And this will be our last one, operator, so we can end before the market opens.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham. Your line is now open.","Rich Kugele","Thank you. Just quickly, Steve, when will the Korat facility be ready to take on the capacity? And should we assume since you\u2019re doing gross margins already in the middle of your target range that once that\u2019s complete you can potentially get to the upper end of that range? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Yes. I guess I don\u2019t want to necessarily say that right at this second. Again, there\u2019s no reason kind of getting wildly speculative about being at the upper end of the range. There\u2019s a lot of issues that go into that. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve disclosed when the Korat facility is going to be fully operational, and I\u2019m not sure we want to from a competitive perspective. So sometime in the next six months we\u2019re rolling into that facility.","Rich Kugele","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Okay. All right. Great. So we\u2019re going to end the call here. Just want to thank everybody, certainly all the employees at Seagate, our suppliers, our customers, our investors and then we look forward to talking to everybody on the next quarter call. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Shanye Hudson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Shanye.","Executive","Shanye Hudson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call. Joining me today are Dave Mosley, Seagate's Chief Executive Officer; and Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our September 2019 quarter on the Investors Section of our website.","During today's call, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in the earnings press release posted on our website and Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We've not reconciled certain non-GAAP outlook measures because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and or cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts.","As a reminder, this call contains forward-looking statements, including our December-quarter financial outlook and expectations about our financial performance, market demand, industry growth trends, planned product introductions, ability to ramp production, future growth opportunities and general market conditions. These statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.","Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental information posted on the Investors Section of our website. Following today's prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Shanye. Good morning, everyone. And for those of you here in Europe, good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. I will start today's call by summarizing key highlights from the September quarter, sharing our views on the market on the relevance to Seagate, and outlining the progress we've made on our key priorities. Afterwards Gianluca will provide further details on our financial results and our outlook for the December quarter. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.","Seagate had a solid start to the fiscal year, increase in revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, earnings per share, cash flow quarter-over-quarter. Our focus on optimizing profit dollars is driving strong and sustainable operating cash flow to fund our future growth, extend our technology leadership and sustain our strong capital return program. Over the past 12 months, we have returned a total of $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase -- reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value.","Our Board approved an increase to our quarterly dividend, demonstrating their confidence in our future growth and cash generation capabilities. This marks the first time in four years that we've raised our dividend. Moving forward, we plan to review the dividend payment consistently over time.","Let me now share some perspectives on the near-term market environment, starting with mass capacity storage. This market is growing, both in terms of dollars and exabytes, and is comprised nearline, video and image applications, including surveillance, and NAS drives. The mass capacity storage market supports cloud and edge applications that are data-centric and require reliable, cost-effective, high-capacity storage best suited to HDD.","In the September quarter, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in nearline, supported by improving demand across cloud and hyperscale customers. We are aggressively ramping our 16-terabyte nearline drives to fulfill strong customer demand for these products. With more than a dozen cloud and OEM customers qualified and several others underway, we are executing very well and are tracking to plan against our product maturity and customer qualification timelines. Based on our current outlook, we expect to ship more than 1 million drives in the December quarter, which would make 16 terabytes the fastest nearline product ramp in Seagate's history.","Revenue from video and image applications declined in the September quarter following an unusually strong June period. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles continued to disrupt customers typical buying patterns across multiple markets, including surveillance. We expect some demand volatility to persist over the near term.","And with the transition to IT 4.0, we see the emergence of edge storage applications, which like surveillance utilize high-definition video and image processing. For example, smart factories, smart cities and IoT, all require large amounts of data, which can benefit from low-cost high-reliability disk drives. We believe these video and image processing applications continue to represent meaningful growth opportunities for Seagate over the long term.","In our legacy markets, which include mission critical, desktop, notebook, DVR, gaming and consumer applications, we saw a seasonal uptick in revenue in the September quarter. As we shared in the past, these markets contributed to Seagate's cash flow while requiring a little additional investment. Importantly, many of the enterprise customers and OEM partners that we are supporting in the legacy markets are the same ones we expect to create new storage growth opportunities at the edge and in private clouds, along with other new customers.","With the trend towards a multi-cloud world and the build-out of the private cloud, customers are seeking to follow the same economical disk-centric storage architectures as the large public cloud providers. Low cost, high-density storage platforms are integral part of the solution to address data-rich workload requirement, as Seagate's high-density scalable system solutions are ideally suited to these big data applications.","We believe Seagate's strong technology road map, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships, make us well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities we foresee ahead. We forecast the mass capacity storage revenue TAM will more than double from current levels by 2025, supported by ongoing demand from the public cloud to build out of the private cloud and emerging edge storage applications. To capture this growing demand, we are executing our strategy to be first to introduce new product solutions in the market and consistently deliver cost and performance benefits to our customers.","Today, Seagate is the only company mass producing 16-terabyte drives, which are the capacity benchmark for the industry. We are preparing to ship 18-terabyte drives in the first half of calendar year 2020 to maintain our industry capacity leadership. We are also driving areal density leadership with our revolutionary HAMR technology, which enables Seagate to achieve at least 20% areal density CAGR over the next decade. We remain on track to ship 20-terabyte HAMR drives in late calendar year 2020.","As drive densities increase multi-actuator technology is required to maintain fast access to data and scale drive capacity without compromising performance. We generated revenue from our MACH.2 dual actuator solutions for the first time in the September quarter. We are working with multiple customers to qualify these drives, including a leading US hyperscale customer, who is qualifying the technology to meet their rigorous service level agreements without having to employ costly hardware upgrades. We expect to see demand for dual actuator technology to increase as customers transition to drive capacities above 20 terabytes.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our September quarter results and share our outlook for the December quarter.","Gianluca Romano","Thank you, Dave. We executed well in the fourth quarter, growing revenue, operating income and operating cash flow to support strong return for our shareholders. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 9% to $2.58 billion, above our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, at the high-end of our guidance range. Our performance was underpinned by improving demand for mass capacity storage. Further, exabyte shipments increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to 98 exabyte, driven largely by our nearline products.","Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes nearline and mission critical drives, representing 45% of total September quarter revenue, up from 41% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments into the enterprise market increased 34% sequentially to 51 exabyte, with nearline drives representing the vast majority of that total. Average capacity for nearline drive increased 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the ongoing transition to higher capacity volume.","Our 16-terabyte drives was a fastest growing nearline product, both in terms of revenue and exabyte. We anticipate strong demand for these products across cloud, hyperscale and OEM partners, and expect 16-terabyte to be our highest enterprise revenue product in fiscal Q2 and our largest company revenue contributor in fiscal Q3, ahead of our prior expectation to meet these milestones in the fiscal Q4 time frame.","Revenue and exabyte shipments for our mission critical drives were sequentially higher in the September quarter. We continue to serve this customer demand for this performance drives, which has remained fairly consistent over the past several quarters. Revenue for the edge non-compute market represented 31% of total September quarter revenue, compared with 34% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments remained flat at 33 exabyte quarter-over-quarter, as non-compute is comprised of surveillance, NAS, gaming, DVR and consumer applications.","As noted on our prior call, a few surveillance customers accelerated demand into the June quarter, which resulted in slightly lower revenue in the quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, applications such as surveillance, which utilize high-definition video and image processing, continue to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Seagate moving forward. Revenue from the edge compute market, including desktop and notebook price, contributed 17% of total revenue compared to 18% in the June quarter. Exabyte shipments increased 7% sequentially to 15 exabytes, reflecting seasonal demand for both desktop and notebook drives.","Aligning with what we presented during our recent Analyst Day, we will change how we present our HDD business. Starting in the December quarter, we will breakout revenue and exabyte shipments in two primary categories, mass capacity storage and legacy market. Mass capacity is made up of nearline, video and image applications and NAS. This represents growing market that support data-centric applications, requiring high capacity, low-cost storage well suited to HDD. Our other HDD products are sold into legacy market. Mass capacity storage has been increasing as a percentage of our total revenue and contributed 47% of September quarter revenue, compared with 35% just two years ago. We expect this growth trend to continue over the next few years.","The legacy markets made up 46% of total September quarter revenue. Our non-HDD business made out the remaining 7% of revenue with growth from both system and SSD solutions. By adding non-hard disk drive revenue, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. We continued to gain traction in our system business with OEMs and other customers. Within our SSD business, the pricing environment has been challenging for multiple quarters. Our main focus has been on enterprise SSDs, which complement our mass capacity HDD solution to provide our customers with a more complete storage solution portfolio. We remain focused on servicing those areas of the market where Seagate can deliver value to our customers.","As a reminder, we're extending the useful life[Phonetic] of our capital equipment from a range of three years to five years to a range of three years to seven years, which resulted from a more efficient use of capital. This change lowered September quarter depreciation by approximately $23 million, a majority of which was included in cost of goods sold. Accounting for these change, non-GAAP gross margins for the September quarter was approximately flat with the prior period at about 27%. On top of the challenging industry conditions we discussed over the last few quarters, we incurred higher-than-expected costs associated with the initial ramp of our new products, which impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect margins to improve as production scale and 16-terabyte drives become a more meaningful part of our total revenues.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the 14-week quarter came in lower than planned at $359 million. Discretionary costs and costs associated with the extra week were both lower than our original outlook. We are continuing to efficiently manage expenses and optimize profitability. In the September quarter, we expanded non-GAAP operating income to $329 million or approximately 13% of revenue. We expect to see financial leverage as we grow revenue and execute our road map to reduce cost per terabyte.","We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million representing about 6% of September quarter revenue. We expect capex for the fiscal year to be near the midpoint of our target range of 6% to 8% of revenue to support our exabyte capacity expansion plans and prepare for the ramp of our HAMR Technology.","We delivered healthy free cash flow of $309 million, up 4% sequentially. We utilized $450 million to retire a 9.2 million ordinary shares, exiting the quarter with 263 million shares outstanding, down 8% from the prior year. Through a combination of opportunistic share repurchase and dividends, we returned $620 million to shareholders in the quarter. As we announced[Phonetic] during the Analyst Day, our Board approved a 3% increase to our quarterly dividend payment to $0.65 per share, payable on January 8, 2020. This increase reflect our positive long-term demand outlook, as well as our confidence in sustainable cash generation.","We've also been focused on further improving our balance sheet. During the September quarter, we successfully marketed a $500 million six-year term loan to restructure a portion of our debt. Through these efforts, we extended leverage debt maturity profile, lowered annual interest expenses by $13 million and reduced total debt to $4.1 billion. As of the end of September, cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion, with access to up to $1.5 billion available through our revolver.","Looking ahead to our outlook for the December quarter, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $2.72 billion plus-or-minus 5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be above the midpoint of our long-term target range of 13% to 16% of revenue, driven by top line growth and improved gross margin. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.32 plus-or-minus 5%.","Overall, we are executing very well, and while we continue to face geopolitical challenges, we believe improving industry demand combined with the ramp of our 16-terabyte drives, a solid foundation for revenue and profitability growth in the fiscal year 2020.","I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Gianluca. In summary, Seagate is consistently delivering solid performance and advancing our key business initiatives. We're generating sustainable cash flow and directing capital towards areas that provide the greatest return for all of our stakeholders. We are successfully scaling exabyte capacity and executing the Company's fastest ever production ramp on a nearline drive at 16 terabytes. We are on track to introduce HAMR and MACH.2 dual-actuator technologies to drive areal density and scale performance with capacity to deliver lower total cost of ownership to our customers over the next decade.","While we are mindful of global macro uncertainties and the recent industry dynamics, we remain focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders by executing our technology road map and optimizing profitability, and free cash flow. We continue to expect revenue and profitability to grow in fiscal 2020, with the second half projected to be somewhat stronger than the first supported by our 16 terabyte ramp and improving mass capacity storage demand. Through our ongoing execution, leading technology roadmap and deep customer relationships, Seagate is well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunities in mass capacity storage.","Before opening the call for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their contributions to the ongoing success of our business.","Gianluca and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is open.","Karl Ackerman","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Two if I may. There has been much investor debate whether you are better positioned among peers, who are gaining share in nearline, as you and one peer have 16-terabyte today, another one is in the lead on 14-terabyte[Phonetic]. But are there any other attributes that you'd like to call out that we should be aware of aside from just capacity per drive that would enable you gain share over the next few quarters? And I have a follow-up, please.","Dave Mosley","Yes, Thanks, Karl. I think, to simply put, the demand is increasing in nearline and we also see that the 16-terabyte is last with customers and so we have fairly good relationships, predictably getting into their architectures. I think we feel pretty comfortable that we'll be able to hit this volume ramp. I can't really speak to what other people might do on their capacity points, but being that, that's a leading exabyte point that's right in front of us. And probably, through significant portion of the next calendar year as well, we feel pretty strong.","Karl Ackerman","Got it. That's helpful. If I could ask you a question on gross margins, which I know that message today and on your Analyst Day has been around operating margins. But one of your competitors this week alluded to some pricing pressure in nearline. Do you think that pricing pressure will get worse before it gets better? Do you think pricing is the main reason why, maybe, we haven't seen an inflection yet in your margins -- gross margins that is despite higher levels of enterprise mix? And maybe more importantly though, as we continue to push the aerial density curve, and you certainly can leverage the additional capital required to pursue this greater complexity of heads and disks in the high-capacity points. Why can't margins push toward that fore handle[Phonetic]? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","They certainly can. I'll let Gianluca elaborate on the impact of the ramp costs that he mentioned in the script. But first just let me say that in our business, to your point, gross margin is a function of supply and demand, very specific to the demand for the products that you have. And for the last few quarters, exabyte demand was relatively weak. I mean, if I go back three quarters ago, we sense this was happening. We made conscious decision to throttle bills, manage cash, inventory, really carefully. And also start converting production to the new platforms. By the way, the new platforms are not just the 16-terabyte, but we have continued to ramp a various cost reductions for other products across the portfolio.","So demand is definitely picking up. That's why -- one of the reasons why we're confident. The strength of the demand will go through the back half of this fiscal year, I think and potentially even further than that. So we feel like calendar year 2020 is very -- is a lot stronger than calendar 2019. And with the new products, I'm confident we'll get into that opex[Phonetic] model range that we talked about. Quite quickly, that's why Gianluca mentioned that we'd be above the midpoint of our long-term operating range in Q2 than what we drive it.","To you point, I think gross margins will rise with all of those dynamics, and Gianluca, I'll let him elaborate here.","Gianluca Romano","Yes. Hey, Karl, thank you for the question. So, as we discussed in the previous earnings release call, we did not ramp all the production at full capacity in the last two or three quarters. And that was generating under-utilization charges that was higher, let's say, three quarters ago and they're starting to reduce. During this period of time, we are still adding capex, giving us the opportunity for even higher capacity when we are ready to take benefit from that. And I know, we have strong demand. So we are ramping hard. It's basically on our 16-terabyte, but also other product on lower capacities.","When we ramp so fast, sometimes you have additional costs, a little bit lower yield, a little bit of additional scrap. We had a little bit of those impacts in F Q1. We don't expect that to happen again in F Q2 and after that. So we expect margins in general, so gross margin and operating margin to improve starting F Q2.","Dave Mosley","And I think, one other point we'd make is that -- to your point, we have to make sure we make the investments. So we've been investing in capex for the heads and media that we need to stage for the exabyte growth. So Let's make sure we make those investments and get paid for those investments. So we're mindful of that over the long term as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from...","Karl Ackerman","Thank you very much.","Operator","Oh Sorry. Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Thanks, good morning. I had two questions. First on, a follow-up on the gross margin question. I know you're not providing guidance beyond the current quarter, but is it safe to assume that as you ramp capacity the yield issues and scrap issues that you mentioned are less than the incremental margins that you would garner from the new products? If you could just sort of elaborate on what that path might look like? And then I have a follow-up.","Dave Mosley","Yes, Steven, that's exactly the right way to think about it. And it's not just one capacity point, which we all tend to fixate on, there's other cost refreshes as we talked about through the rest of the portfolio. So we feel pretty good about that strength going into next year.","Gianluca Romano","And in this, to bear in mind, we are saying that we expect the second half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first half. So, of course, this is part of our confidence in the result.","Steven Fox","All right, that's helpful. And then just a question on the surveillance drives. I understand what you said in the prepared remarks about the tougher comparisons in some of the changes that you saw this quarter. What is the recent demand, say, though for surveillance drive prospects for the next few quarters? Are you lowering those or do you see different mix of capacity points, etc? Could you just give a little bit more view on that? Thanks.","Steven Fox","All right, that's helpful. And then just a question on the surveillance drives. I understand what you said in the prepared remarks about the tougher comparisons in some of the changes that you saw this quarter. What is the recent demand, say, though for surveillance drive prospects for the next few quarters? Are you lowering those or do you see different mix of capacity points, etc? Could you just give a little bit more view on that? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","It's a really interesting question. If I go back about a year to 18 months, the demand -- the box demand was actually higher. The exabytes have grown certainly in surveillance and some of the other mass capacity markets. But we started talking about three quarters ago about demand disruptions. And it's kind of interesting, the people want to focus that on just one local, but really that can be much more broadly based and it could have to do with people pulling stuff in, because they are speculative, maybe I think, they can gain share or something like that. So that demand has been disruptive for quite a while.","The end demand -- the end market demand is strong for exabyte, and we believe it will continue to grow strongly next year. Exactly how we satisfy that demand is -- it is still a question. And what's interesting about some of the global markets is they're, really more what we call white brand markets. There is -- the people making the final buy decision out there is actually doing integration in a business or in a home or something like that. But it is a fairly small box size. We don't think that end demand is slowing down at all. As a matter of fact, we think it's growing.","Steven Fox","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. A couple of questions. First, enterprise price per exabyte sell much more this quarter than in the recent history. Can you just talk about, is that mix or like-for-like price aggression in the market?","Dave Mosley","I think -- I don't think ours fell too much. I mean we're still analyzing what just went up. But I don't think ours fell too much. I think Katy, what I would say is that, a few quarters ago demand was soft, and so therefore there may have been some behaviors like that. I think as we feel -- going forward, we feel very confident about where we are, and that's one of the reasons why we think we can get back to that gross margin range.","Katy Huberty","And then last quarter you talked about some different behavior in buying in the China market. Intel gave an actual revenue attribution to some pull forward of demand ahead of tariffs. Any dynamic in your business this quarter, as it relates to a benefit from early buying around trade negotiations?","Dave Mosley","I would say that, it's still disturbed. And to your point, that's kind of what we discussed, not only last quarter but the quarter before, I think as well. There -- it's a Steven's question. Those disturbances are still present. I think we said something like that in the prepared remarks as well. I think that the end demand is still not strong. And I feel like calendar year 2020 will be better than calendar year 2019. We're certainly going into January quarter last year. We were signaling that we saw the softness. So the end demand is still there, I think, and it's just a matter of how do we exactly fulfill that end demand.","Gianluca Romano","And then...","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Gianluca Romano","Katy, going back to your question for price impact terabyte in nearline, as you know, we also increased our average capacity per drive in that segment. And usually when you have this increase of the average capacity, you have a little bit of decrease in price per terabyte.","Katy Huberty","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can. I guess, going back a little bit to the gross margin line. Obviously, the yield ramp on 16 TBs and then I guess, as we look forward, the progression of HAMR into next year. But I'm just curious as you kind of add capacity, how should we think about the level of capacities shipped as kind of -- your kind of full utilization level here as we look out over the next couple of quarters? I'm just kind of curious relative to where we stand this last quarter at 98 exabytes.","Dave Mosley","Yes, I think the exabyte capacity will go up very strongly over the next few quarters. I'll let Gianluca talk here in a second. But Aaron, the way I would say it is 16 terabytes of some of the driver for that. There is other products across the portfolio that are driving as well, the margin improvement. We think we've positioned things well. It's a subtle point but a lot of the capital positioning is actually in heads and media. So it's different than drive capacity if you will. So, -- and so we're really responding proactively to that exabyte growth, making sure we have the right products ramped and at good yields and everything when the demand gets bigger.","Gianluca Romano","Yes, we are still not at full capacity, and we are still adding some capex. We have a huge expectation for volume increase demand in the next, I would say, two or three quarters. So we are preparing to satisfy that demand. And we should be at full capacity, I would say, maybe in two quarters from now. But of course CapE we want to add in few days.","Dave Mosley","And over the very long -- you know that's long lead time capital as well. But over the very long haul, I think to one of the earlier questions. We need to make sure we have that capacity in place, because we do believe there'll be constraints.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, as -- there was, not necessarily a competitor of yours, but a company last night alluded to basically a notable pause at one of the hyperscale guys. They also talked about hyperscale companies moving to more -- almost a more real-time procurement cycle. How would you characterize your engagement with the hyperscale guys as far as the visibility in demand for the nearline drives? Has that changed at all over the past few quarters as we kind of think about this recovery that seems to be you're confident kind of continuing to last over the next couple of quarters?","Dave Mosley","I would characterize our engagement as very strong, and their problems -- depending on who they are, they're different, but their problems are very complex. So it's not a one size fits all the answer. And I think part of the issue that you might see with other companies that I won't speculate too much, but the issues you might see if you're qualified on one part of an architecture and also that architecture gets delayed for whatever reason, it could be impactful.","I think, generally speaking, some componentry and hard drives are in there as well, tend to be fairly broad-based, although, for example, we may have an 8-terabyte drive qualified on one architectural point and that doesn't move as fast. So it's not like the entire fleet transitions at the same time. These customers have complex not only supply chains, but also problems sets themselves. And I'm speaking globally as well. As the bigger the world gets, the more -- there is some of these inherent inhibitions to transitions. They have to make sure that they test them against more complex set. So it's not surprising to me that from time to time that you can see one architecture affecting you. But I think most of the demand that we see is -- across exabytes broad based across architectures that -- what drives our confidence.","Aaron Rakers","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.","Christopher Muse","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Your first question, as you think about the 16-terabyte ramp really accelerating in the first half of the year, how should we think about seasonality into your March quarter versus what typically at least over the last five years is tracked down 10% sequentially?","Dave Mosley","Yes, good question. Thanks. There will be seasonality in some of the legacy markets that we always talk about. But I think the exabyte demand in the mass capacity markets is strong. And there, obviously, dynamics in one quarter with Chinese New Year coming and then the quarter after that is the seasonally weakest quarter, but we think that there is such strength. That's why we're so confident in our back-half revenue numbers that I may have referenced here earlier.","There is also a fairly large transition that will happen between people who would -- exactly to the earlier question, the people who were on 8s or 12s or 14s and made transition to the 16s, or 18s, sometime way next year. As all those transitions go up, the exabytes growth is very good. And so getting out substantially is our top priority.","Christopher Muse","Very helpful. As my follow-up, considering you had the extra week in the September quarter, is the math just simply removing that week, so roughly $350 million opex, and as part of that, how should we kind of model that trajectory of opex beyond the December quarter into calendar 2020.","Gianluca Romano","Yes, OpEX F Q1 was actually will be better than what we were planning. But you are right. So if -- one-extra week, I would model fairly flat for the next, maybe quarter or two.","Dave Mosley","We think we can support all the customer transitions that we need to without raising opex -- we can always trim if we had to, depending on macro conditions. But we don't really see that need right now. So I think flat is a good way to model it.","Christopher Muse","So to be clear. So flat at $378 million[Phonetic] even though you had the extra week in September?","Gianluca Romano","I think, your $378 million is providing including share-based compensation. So you should take that out of there. Just look at what we reported yesterday.","Christopher Muse","Okay, good.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Yes, thanks for taking the question guys. I was going to say good morning but good afternoon for you guys. Two, if I could. The first is a clarification on gross margin. Gianluca, you had mentioned one or two items that could be adjusted back to get a sense of structural gross margin. You mentioned 50 basis point headwind from new product ramp costs, and then there is mention of a $23 million impacting gross margin as well. Are those separate items? And I guess, my question, if they are, is it an accurate way to think of kind of structural gross margin, I guess, 50 basis points impact from each of that. So it would be actually be a 100 basis points higher for the quarter. And walk us through that If that's not accurate. Thanks. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Gianluca Romano","I'm sorry, Ananda, we couldn't hear you second part of the question. So a 50 basis points we got it. What is the second one?","Ananda Baruah","The other one was, there was a mention -- you made a mention of a $23 million impact. And the question is, is that separate from the 50 basis points from the new product cost ramps?","Gianluca Romano","Yes, so -- yes. And the 50 basis points that are related to, let's say, lower yields and higher scrap -- related to that ramp, we don't expect that to happen in F Q2. So you should count that as an improvement. I think the $23 million that I mentioned in the prepared remarks were the depreciation change -- was a impact of the depreciation. Now in F Q2, you will have a little bit higher impact. So you should consider also this one. The timing when you start the change, part of the impact is in inventory. So Q1 was -- P&L impact was $23 million [Indecipherable] a little bit higher, not much higher, a little bit higher.","Ananda Baruah","Got it. Understood. And then the second question is just with regards to where the hyperscale cycle is right now? Dave, is it accurate that you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it's a little bit of ahead of expectations were you guys thought it would be? And then I guess like, how -- you made comments in the past about what you think potential for this cycle could be with regards to growth. Do you still feel those are valid? Could you give us an update there? How you feel, sort of, what you're thinking in terms of growth potential?","Dave Mosley","Yes, from the demand perspective, it's about where we thought it would be. It doesn't mean that it ticks and ties everywhere where we thought it would be, but it's about relative to where we thought it would be. There is some indication that there is -- to the point I made earlier about the complexity that some of the global partners have to qualify new products and things like that. We think that there is a little bit of an urge around that, but obviously[Phonetic], suggest that even thought it might be later, it suggests a higher demand to get back to the point of 18 months ago when the demand was very high. So that's one of the reasons we feel comfortable about the demand cycle.","I think, what we talked about was a 16 terabytes on plan to slightly ahead of plan. So happy with the qualifications across more than a dozen OEMs now. We start -- we ship those first drives in April remember. So there has been a lot of work to get here. The qualifications have run very well. Customer demand is high and that's where we get more bullish.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, that's great. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mitch Steves","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions -- the first one is just to kind of flesh out a bit on the data center side. So if I hear this right, the data center piece is probably going to be one of the faster growing end markets for you guys in kind of December and March. Are there any ways to directionaly help us out in terms of what markets you guys have seen do better over the next couple of quarters or so?","Dave Mosley","Yes, I think definitely data centers are the strength that we're seeing. We call it all there, like -- I get your your point, but globally, different people are building on different types of data centers. But we call it all nearline strength.","Mitch Steves","Yes. The second one I had is, your competitors kind of talked about the 30% gross margins for hard disk drive in December. So how long should we expect kind of a product transition? I kind of understand the investments cycle out there. But how long should we wait? And do you guys think you can hit maybe 30% on the HDD side?","Gianluca Romano","Well, we don't guide gross margin. As I said, we expect F Q2 to be higher than F Q1, and you can probably model based on our revenue and EPS guidance. But as we said, we expect an improvement quarter-over-quarter.","Dave Mosley","Yes, the opex will be above the midpoint of the range as well. And so we'll just -- continue to look at the value that we provide. And customers' demand, like I said, is strong. So we continue to work that. Our cost reductions are good. So all vectors are pointed in the right way -- direction. But we don't want to get specific on guidance.","Mitch Steves","Yes, let me ask you in a different way. Is 30% attainable for the Company, gross margins long term?","Dave Mosley","Certainly, the demand -- if the demand picture is high enough, Yes. I mean we...","Mitch Steves","Okay.","Dave Mosley","Eventually driven the capital -- the operations to be sized for exabyte growth. And if the demand picture goes there then we have the right products to get it. Sure.","Mitch Steves","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good morning. I have two questions as well. Thanks for taking them. First is on the fiscal 20 revenue outlook. I think at the Analyst Day the Company talked about the potential for revenue to increase in fiscal 2020. And on the comments today, I think, we talked about having some good backlog and expecting strength in second half fiscal 2020. So as you sit today, do you still think that's achievable? And any more quantification you may be able to provide around fiscal 2020 Revenue.","Dave Mosley","Yes, that's the right takeaway mark, and that's where the confidence comes. The one thing, we did -- I did mentioned earlier was, as some of the transitions that are going on globally from one platform to another in spite some of the different customers, there is more opportunity I think for us to have a better product portfolio in there, whether it's a lower cost, lower capacity drives or whether it's the 16-terabyte kind of marquee point, that provides us opportunities to get more revenue than we have.","Mark Delaney","Okay. That's helpful. And my second question is a follow-up on some of the prior questions on gross margins. I understand and there has been some near term headwinds around cost and yields. But if we look at gross margins for both Seagate and your main competitor there, they're down cycle-to-cycle compared to where they had been in past points when nearline was doing well.","I'm assuming pricing has gotten a bit more difficult. But is there anything else beyond pricing, that those maybe more structural? I don't know if nearline mix increases more towards hyperscale compared to be more balanced in the past between OEM and hyperscale. Is that having an effect or anything else that may be more structural versus temporal in nearline gross margins? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","Yes, I can only really speak to us. So what I would say is that demand is not as strong as it was 18 months ago, to your point. The peak at the last cycle, Q4, Q1 a year ago, demand was quite strong then. So it's not been a strong, but we think it's the strength of building, and that's what we've been talking about, and then having the right products in the market that we feel comfortable to ramp and high volume against that, that's what gives us the confidence.","Mark Delaney","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Vijay Rakesh","Yes, hi guys. I just wondering as you look at the next time of transition, when do you expect that to ramp? What do you expect the mix would be end of 20 years, mid-2021ph? And if you could give us some margin profile or cost profile on that? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","Yes, I think that's -- Thanks for the question. There is -- the highest capacities, which -- depending on where you're shipping them, the qualification cycles can be long or short. There's also opportunities for even lower capacities built out in that same platform. So, we will ramp that to your point as the yields makes sense. And if the cost makes sense to insert in the market. As time goes on, we gain confidence because we keep solving the engineering problems. So we're pretty happy about that. I think there is 18-TB before, there's 20-TB as well. So I think that's going to come to the market. But the HAMR transition is ultimately something that's going to drive us forward into 2021 and 2022. And we'll continue to ramp there.","Vijay Rakesh","Got it. And then, I think you mentioned nearline or overall you're seeing a little softness. As you look through 2021, do you expect overall data center spending, nearline spending to be more back half loaded or middle of the year, any some more colour if you can give? Thanks.","Gianluca Romano","Are you talking about fiscal year or calendar year?","Vijay Rakesh","Calendar year, sorry.","Dave Mosley","Oh Sorry, Calendar year, so yes, calendar year 2019 was relatively muted, especially in the first two quarters. Calendar year 2020 will be stronger year-over-year and it's more broad based exactly to your questions. That -- not only the exabyte transitions that are going on, but the demand picture as well.","Vijay Rakesh","Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. Earlier in the call, you mentioned you will be fully loaded or higher utilization rates, can you remind us of that time period, and was that calendar or fiscal year? And then as a follow-up as HAMR ramps up, will there be much of a impact to operating or gross margins? As we go about that, I know, certain technology changes. Do you have a meaningful impact to margins like short-term headwind and then longer-term positive, but I just didn't know what's HARM ramping if it's going to be material to your company-wide margins? Thank you.","Gianluca Romano","Yes, in terms of capacity, I said we will be close to full capacity in the next couple of quarters. So let's say in the first half of calendar year. And Dave maybe taking the HAMR question.","Dave Mosley","Yes, I think on HAMR we will do the right thing. As time goes on, we'll continue to manage for operating income and free cash flow and continue to work the cost to the earlier question. I don't expect it to change the model. Obviously, we want to drive the model as hard as we can, and if we can drive it to the high end or drive the model up that's great too. But I don't expect HAMR to change the model.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for your clarifications. Its greatly appreciated.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dave Mosley for closing remarks.","Dave Mosley","Thank you. Once again thank all of our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners for all their contributions to our third quarter performance, and thanks to our shareholders for their ongoing support.

And welcome to the Seagate Technology Fiscal Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Liz and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participate are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over it to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick - Seagate Technology Plc","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President and COO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group. We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com.","For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growths trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets.","In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology and heads of media, as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance.","Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change for the investment community in the short term, but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner.","During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks, as time permits.","We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and\/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investor section of the company's website.","I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter as well as an update for the calendar year.","For the March quarter, Seagate achieved: revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.5%; net income of $194 million; and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved: gross margins of 31.4%, up 870 basis points year-over-year; net income of $329 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $426 million, up 108% year-over-year.","Our March quarter results reflect a relatively stable demand environment and improved profitability year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 65.5 exabytes, up approximately 18% year-over-year. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, up 27% year-over-year. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the March quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated 19% year-over-year growth in the March quarter, with particular strength in our flash-based solutions.","We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the March quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our storage technology portfolio and our continued execution on operational efficiencies.","I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities.","David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Steve. For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year.","HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU.","Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DDR and NAS markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year.","In our mature mission critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue.","Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to non-executive variable compensation.","Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at, or very near, full capacity.","Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual non-executive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million.","Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter in $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5.","In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with a weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve as a pre-financing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1.","Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.","Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our Storage portfolio. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our Storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential.","While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond.","I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Thanks, Dave. A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals.","We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts in application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing flash devices.","The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is a result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class storage technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: in the nearline market, our 10 terabyte Helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte Helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications.","We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio, utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology. And to-date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in areal density will continue through calendar 2017.","Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products including our first offering for the drone marketplace, the Fly Drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer, DJI.","From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation areal density HAMR technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs.","Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect a seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space.","We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%, and we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual.","We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal 2018 outlook on our July call.","Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we'll now open the call up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. Maybe discuss your go-forward exabyte growth expectations by the segments as you lay them out. And specifically...","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","We're not going to provide exabyte growth by segments. That's highly competitive information.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Maybe I should ask...","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","We still believe in exabyte growth that's consistent with what we've said over the last couple of years. Exabyte growth in excess of areal density growth.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Can nearline still grow in the mid to high-30%s this year after the 20% start? I ask because the remaining quarters have some pretty difficult comps. So maybe talk a little bit more detail with that.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Yes, I do think they can. As you see the 10s and 12s start to ramp. I think the first half of the year has been an issue both of what's really the right marketplace for the 10 terabyte, especially with the 12 kind of coming right behind it, as well as the CSPs have been \u2013 and we've kind of expected this the whole time, that the second half of the year was going to be stronger than the first half of the year. So I think the combination of stronger demand signals for the second half plus the rotation of the portfolio that's going to have 8s, 10s and 12s and not just pretty much 8s, you're going to see exabyte growth there that's going to continue.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, price per exabyte declined at the lowest rate in a few years. It's now the second quarter you're kind of in a 13% to 14% range versus the low 20%s range that the industry has been in. What is a good expectation to model going forward, given you said you're generally near peak capacity?","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Yes. I think that's a great question. I think we've got to continue to be very careful on the pricing, especially, again, as you go from 10s and 12s. On the one hand, the customer demand is certainly there for those higher capacity drives, but the industry's capability to deliver that technology is coming through solutions that effectively cost more.","Either you're adding more heads in disk or other technology to handle that kind of workload. And especially when you're adding more heads in disk, you have to obviously be very careful about the aggressive price takedowns that have occurred because somehow you have to absorb the extra parts. So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology.","And, of course, we're not going to end at 10s or 12s. We're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology. So we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization in that pricing.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Parker with BTIG.","Edward Parker - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you about price elasticity and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the impact of higher NAND pricing in the quarter on your HDD business. Are you seeing higher unit sales because of higher prices for SSDs or higher unit sales because of the lack of availability for SSDs?","And then secondly, how do you think about price elasticity across your portfolio? And how could that change as you look at your business over the next couple of years?","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because, at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is even a 500-gig NAND drive, at today's prices or even at six months ago prices, aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price.","I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around do they use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they shift their NAND. Does to go into phones? Does it go into the data centers? Does it go into the servers or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in six months ago and then what customers are asking for, there's this constant re-optimization of where the NAND is flowing.","I think in the short term probably, and I think HP indicated this on their call two quarters ago, that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathes some more life into the HDD space, in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type. And, of course, there again we're talking about 128 or 256.","For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1TB, where we have a substantial lead, and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500- gig product because at volume, obviously, it's a single-disk and two-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year and maybe even to the beginning of next year.","I think where it's more problematic for the industry in general, and I mean everyone, is if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages. And we have seen indications of certain deployments being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experience that a little bit in our own CSSG business, where we obviously need to get flash to sell our flash drives.","We have a big demand profile for our current-generation products, which are quite competitive. But we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of can we get the flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard and one of the reasons that I think there is some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of.","I don't know that it's as easy to say that it's good or bad. I think there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people have more devices in their hand and they're creating more data. And that's still our thesis.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Steve, can you just elaborate a little more about your comment that less than 10% of your portfolio would be exposed to competing flash devices? Like over what timeframe are you referring and how do you get there? Is that walking away from categories, or is that just a mix change towards more cloud service providers?","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Well, I'll let Mosley go into more details, but we've already walked away from those markets. Basically, again, we don't participate in the 500 gigabyte market really today. Ad that's because we have a technology lead and we want to leverage that. And, of course, the recent price increases from the NAND folks have made a 500 gigabyte drive unattainable, for sure. Even the 256s, I think we've heard price talks in the $60 or $70 range, which is pretty amazing. So I think it's a more longer-term trend, and I'll have Dave talk to it, but it doesn't really talk to the CSPs. The CSPs are enabled by all tiers of storage.","William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah, Rich. This is Dave. I would go back to Ed's question as well to dovetail on to that. So we have to model what the NAND pricing is going to be out in time. And then we model where Seagate wants to be selling product; is it 500 gigabytes, 1 terabyte, 2 terabyte and so on. And we look at those price banding for our various market segments and we make those estimates.","So we what we said is, over the next year, it'll develop such that less than 10% of our portfolio is exposed. I think by this time next year, it will be far less than 10%. And we're working hard to make sure that happens, make sure we move up in capacity points. Of course, some of that's what the customers want and some of that is dictated by where exactly the NAND pricing is. But that's how we run the model.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. And then just lastly as a follow-up, the Systems business you said a good quarter on the flash side, but embedded in there is also the systems that are going to some enterprise players, like HP, for the mid-range MSA stuff. So in light of the Nimble acquisition, just how should he with think about the Storage Systems business?","Philip G. Brace - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah, Rich. This is Phil. The Storage Systems business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well, year-over-year growth. And we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space.","What we see is that as OEMs look to be figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come in and work with them on higher levels of integration. And that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between, I'll say, our component-related products, like SSDs and HDs, and our system-level products. So, overall, that business continues to grow nicely.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","We have time for one more question I think.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. I guess I wanted to follow up on Rich's question on the Systems business. If you go back, you guys have made a couple of acquisitions both in Systems and with LSI on the flash side. And yet it's still well under 10% of revenue. I was just wondering from a strategic standpoint, as Systems are moving higher up the enterprise stack, is that strategically a big part of what you guys are looking to do do you think over the next few years, or is that kind of taking a back seat? Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Yeah, I don't think it's really changed much in terms of our original intention. We've always felt there's an opportunity in the Systems business in the higher value-add categories because our Systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space. And more and more so, we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device level.","So I think, from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level. But really the opportunity to, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices, either at the device level, the sub-system level or the systems level. And if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think will be a potentially significant long-term trend.","I think the issue is, one, is that how does that evolve, over what period of time and what does it cost you in the mean time? And so I think, for us, we continue to work the financial model so the Systems business is profitable to the overall business and then gives us the option to grow into some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level. And we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us.","I would say, if anything, over the last six to 12 months we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged. So we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we with think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Makes sense. Thank you.","Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc","Okay. Great. All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate the time you've taken this morning. And I want to again thank our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our shareholders. And we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect.

My name is John, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kate Scolnick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick","Good morning, and welcome to today's call. I'm joined today in Cupertino by Seagate CEO, Steve Luczo; CFO, Pat O'Malley; Dave Mosley, EVP of Operations; and Rocky Pimentel, EVP of Sales. We have posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal first quarter 2013 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com.","During today's call, Steve will review the highlights from the September quarter and provide the company's outlook for the December quarter. After that, we will open up the call to questions.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements, included, but not limited to, statements related to the company's historical and currently anticipated future operating and financial performance in the September quarter and thereafter, and includes statements regarding customer demand for disk drives and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views of any subsequent date, and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.","I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen J. Luczo","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd first like to express our concern and sympathies to those that have been impacted by the storm on the East Coast and are enduring difficult times. I also want to thank all past and present Seagate employees, as well as local and central government officials in China, as we just celebrated the production of our 1 billionth drive from our China operations. We accomplished this remarkable feat in just 17 years, and we expect that the company will ship its 2 billionth disk drive this quarter. Congratulations to all involved.","Seagate's first quarter results reflect strong operational performance as the company responded quickly to demand and product mix shifts in a challenging environment. We effectively adjusted production and maintained inventory turns in our target range and ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than the June quarter.","For the September quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $594 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.45. We maintained our commitment to returning value to shareholders with over 70% of the $1.1 billion in operating cash flow generated during the quarter, returned to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends. Over the last 3 quarters, Seagate's ordinary share count has been reduced by 17%, and dilution from options and equity awards has been reduced by 45%.","As with most global technology companies, our financial performance is being impacted by a wide range of factors, including: sluggish macroeconomic growth in all major markets, as well as a slowdown in the BRIC economies; business-spending restraint related to the U.S. federal deficits and the upcoming fiscal cliff in the United States; supply chain and systems inventory adjustments by our major PC OEMs; weaker enterprise demand in Europe; adjustments to PC systems related to the Windows 8 release; changes in PC demand related to tablets; and lastly, the lack of significant product innovation in the notebook space. Due to these factors, the September quarter was more than seasonally back-end loaded, and the overall industry demand environment was approximately 10% lower than we had expected going into the quarter.","Despite the reduced addressable market, we effectively balanced supply and demand, shipping approximately 43 exabytes of storage and maintaining market share. Our shipments into the client market declined 12% quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with unit declines reported by other technology companies in the PC space and slightly better than the decline reported in tablet sales.","The enterprise market was weaker than we expected this quarter, down 26% sequentially. Despite the sequential reduction in the addressable market, on a year-over-year basis, Seagate grow unit shipments by 14% and increased average capacity per drive by 17% to 738 gigabytes.","Non-GAAP product margins for the September quarter were 29%, which is at the midpoint of our long-term margin range of 27% to 32%, but was slightly below our expectations. The pricing environment and the benefit we received from cost improvements from product transitions were within the expected ranges for the quarter. However, sales volumes and mix from enterprise products were below expectations. In addition, margins on the sale of our products at Brazil were materially lower than we expected, impacting gross margins by approximately 100 basis points.","As we discussed at our strategic update in New York a few weeks ago, as the hard drive industry has evolved and matured, it has improved its alignment of supply and demand, particularly in an environment such as the one we are in now, where demand is less than what the industry forecast and the industry and each company is capable of producing more drives than current demand requires.","Seagate will continue to adjust in -- quickly adjust in-quarter production to align to the demand requirements we are experiencing. And we will manage our inventory aggressively, as evidenced in the September quarter. Further, we will reduce our capital expenditures and align our investments to meet near-term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital in anticipation of a recovery of demand. As a result, Seagate is in a better position to focus on effective supply and demand balances and financial model resiliency in both the near term, as well as with respect to long-term return on our research and development and capital investments.","Looking ahead, we are approaching the December quarter conservatively based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and on our current assessment of the following issues I previously outlined. In general, we remain concerned with global macroeconomic conditions. While we do see some signs of China stabilizing, we do not anticipate significant improvements to the current growth rates in China until late spring 2013. In the United States, it is uncertain that the fiscal cliff will be avoided. Regardless, large federal, state and local budget deficits will continue to weigh on growth prospects. We expect continued economic weakness in Europe.","In addition to these economic concerns, we remain cautious in OEM demand as many customers are still working through client systems inventory balances. We expect enterprise demand to remain weak, particularly due to the enterprise markets' exposure to the European economies. We believe that tablet offerings will continue to evolve and may result in the notebook refresh cycle to lengthen, depending on macroeconomic conditions and competitive product offerings. We are optimistic that the wide variety of new notebook offerings, including thin and light systems, will result in renewed growth in this market over the next 12 months. We also remain optimistic about the long-term impact of Windows 8 and other operating systems that enhance the user experience by incorporating touch, keyboard, pen, voice and gesture.","Based on all these considerations, our forecast for the December quarter assumes the market to be relatively flat sequentially. And as a result, we are continuing to constrain builds and manage inventory. Based on already completed negotiations associated with the current quarter, we expect that the ASPs will decline about 5%. We are currently forecasting second fiscal quarter revenues of approximately $3.5 billion, with margins at the lower end of our new long-term range of 27% to 32%.","For the December quarter, we are planning for our operating expenses to increase slightly sequentially and reflect a full quarter of expenses from the acquisition of LaCie in our retail business. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations, including investments related to technology transitions as opposed to installing new capacity. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue, including a replacement of our media R&D facility in Fremont, California in November.","In terms of returning value to shareholders, we are planning to return approximately 70% of our operating cash flow this fiscal year through our share redemption program and dividends. We are maintaining our target for approximately $350 million ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the December quarter.","In conjunction with our purchase of the Samsung hard drive business line last year, our shareholder agreement requires us to file an S-3 and register the 45.2 million shares we issued to them by September 19. Samsung has indicated that they intend to maintain their position in Seagate for the foreseeable future. And as a reminder, these shares were already reflected in our ordinary share count.","Given the flat demand environment we are experiencing, as well as the uncertainty around the issues we discussed impacting demand, we expect to be in a better position to update our financial expectations for the fiscal year and calendar year when we report our second quarter fiscal results in January. With respect to price negotiations that will occur this quarter related to the March quarter, we expect that ASPs will remain relatively flat.","We currently expect macro unpredictability and rapid technology and computer industry change to continue, and we continue to implement investment and business processes designed to build a business model with higher margins to withstand fluctuations in demand. We believe the best reflection of this effort is represented by the low end of our gross margin range being higher than the high end of our previous gross margin range.","Data consumption and creation and global Internet connectivity growth continue to be very robust. At the same time, computing is changing fundamentally and at a rapid place, driven by open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures, and mobility. Because of our leadership position in storage, we have a high degree of engagement with a wide spectrum of customers from end users to OEMs to cloud service providers. We are now on our third-generation, solid-state hybrid notebook drives, and we are expanding this technology into desktop and enterprise products. We also have new 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter products at customers for qualification and evaluation, which position us very well for the new thin and light notebook systems.","In summary, we believe Seagate is well positioned to sustain strong financial performance in this challenging economic environment, as well as to address the opportunities associated with the needs of cloud computing and mobile connectivity.","John, we're now ready to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Cihra from Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask a question on the, I guess, the enterprise weakness or shortfall in the September quarter and then continuing to the December quarter. Maybe Steve or whomever. How much of that do you think is the market because you did cite Europe? And how much of that was sort of inventory drawdown, and where we are in that inventory drawdown process?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, it's the right question. And unfortunately, it's a little hard to see, because I think the third element that's probably playing into that is the architectural changes as well. We're definitely seeing more customers that are building various types of either private or public cloud infrastructures that are purchasing systems maybe away from the traditional OEMs, whether or not they're going directly or whether or not they may be buying architectures from smaller start-ups. But I think it's the right combination between people that acquired inventory in the March and June quarters in anticipation or concern around recovery still in enterprise from the supply chain disruptions caused by the flood combined with the slowdown. So I think there is an inventory overhang that's still being addressed. And then there's also, I think, some competitive issues where certain of the OEMs maybe just aren't having the sell-through that they thought they were, which may be related to macro or may be competitive issues. But it's definitely a combination of the 3 things of a changing customer base that's responding to a new architecture and then inventory absorption, as well as -- I do think the macro impact is significant, though I've been a little surprised that the European situation hasn't kind of shown its head earlier just because most of the enterprise companies still have somewhere between 25% and 40% of the revenue exposure in Europe, which is different than the client side or consumer technology companies.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just, everything you just said, do you think that applies equally to mission critical and business critical, or is most of that more mission critical?","Stephen J. Luczo","I think it applies equally. I think, probably, the comments around cloud service providers and architectures is probably more of a nearline business critical point than mission critical, but I think there basically was inventory buy-in on nearline as well. Again, a lot of the OEMs feed the cloud market as well, right? So I think it applies to both of them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Steve, just want to try to get your take about the OEM inventory. I know you talked a little bit about inventory more broadly, but specifically at the OEM in the channel? And then I had a follow-up please.","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think there's 2 levels of inventory, obviously, at the OEMs, right? One is the device level inventory and then the other is the system level inventory. And I think the comments I just made, I think, at the device level, I think there was probably a fair amount of buy-in really in the June quarter with still some concerns around the recovery of the drive industry. And then I think that, that buy-in happened to coincide with the slowdown that really started at the tail end of the June quarter. I mean to me, 2012 feels a lot like 2010, where we start getting this rollover in May and then things never recovered for the rest of the year. And I think for the OEMs, they were buying in inventory, and then things started to slow down. And it's always a little confusing in June when things slow down because it's the summer, and that's a typically slow period anyhow. And you hope it recovers in September. We really didn't see that recovery, and I think people, clearly, are grasping the macroeconomic issues a little better now as being more significant than maybe we thought 3, 4, 5 months ago. So I think at the OEM level, it's a combination of a lot of system inventory, and initially, in the summer, and device inventory. Then I think probably, trying to bleed down that inventory in anticipation of Windows 8. Clearly, people are trying to get lean on how many of the old systems they're carrying in order to be prepared to ramp as Windows 8's released. And then depending on the robustness of demand for Windows 8, I think they'll be able to respond. So I think it's -- again, I think it's a similar story, just different reasons, maybe more related to Windows as opposed to cloud architecture changing.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But in terms of just run rates, do you feel like their finished goods inventory and\/or channel is at a point where the ships of your drives will match whatever their end demand is? So do you think things are kind of evened out? I know it's hard to see.","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think the channel actually feels better to me, if you're talking about -- the distribution channel, with respect to device level technology, feels better. Our position is about 1 million units less than it was last quarter and within our range of 4 to 6 weeks. I'm not that concerned about the distribution channel. I think in the OEMs, there's -- depending on the customer, there's probably still some work to be done. I would say at the margin, I feel -- I wish inventories at the customer level were a little lower, both on the systems side probably and the device side. So again, that's one of the reasons that's weighing on our flat TAM assumption. I think probably end user TAM is actually probably going to grow by low-single digits or maybe even mid-single digits. But I still think there's inventory adjustments to be had.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. My follow-up, then I'll cede the floor is -- Steve, you mentioned you thought ASPs in the March quarter would be flat. I just wanted to see if you could flush that out a little bit. It would be unusual relative to history for those March quarter ASPs to be flattish. Just curious, a little bit of feedback.","Stephen J. Luczo","Thank you. Well, yes, the difference in history, I suppose, is the structure of the industry. I think the major point that we're trying to convey is in -- this quarter is when we negotiate prices for next quarter. So if you think about it in reverse, for the quarter we're in now, we negotiated those prices in September or late August. And I would say that I kind of feel that the December pricing probably got away from us just a touch with the demand falling off as much as it did in September. And trying to, I think, recognize what was the real TAM going to be for the December quarter, I think the industry and probably our customers were hoping that it was going to be more in the 150 or 155 range. So I think the industry is probably recognized that the March quarter is likely to be pretty flat to or maybe marginally up. And that we're really not going to buy TAM with pricing. And so I think, we've obviously gotten to pricing levels that are as low as we want to see them if we're bumping on the bottom end of our range. And so, it's important for us to make sure we maintain discipline going forward, so we can get our R&D and capital investments where we want for the long term. So that's the way we're going to approach the March quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","A couple of questions. First of all, just further on the March pricing and looking forward. Can you sort of describe what kind of mix you anticipate in March, how much that's helping the overall ASP? And then secondly, Steve, you talked a lot about macro pressures that are hard to figure out when they're going to end and so on. If this goes on, say, for 9, 12 months, is there plans to take capacity down? Or do you think you're comfortable operating in these margins on the capacity level as you've got currently?","Stephen J. Luczo","Thanks, let me just make some notes, so I don't forget. On the first thing, on March pricing, I think, Steven, the mix assumptions -- look, we've been kind of off on mix for a couple of 3 quarters in a row here where the mix assumptions we've had, basically, don't come to fruition. And part, I think, is that's just because the pressure that the systems vendors are under to maintain margins. I think mix is -- the assumptions for mix are basically pretty conservative for the March quarter. So if there was actually an improvement in mix, which would be what we would hope, especially if there's any sort of recovery in March on the enterprise, then I think that the relatively flat ASPs, hopefully, will prove to be conservative. So we have tried to, at least this time, assume a pretty conservative view on mix, to say relatively flat ASPs, because as you know, obviously, with new products coming on and mix improving, it actually probably increase ASPs. On the macroeconomic situation and how long does it have to last for it to be really painful. That's a good question. And I would say if we had -- I guess, the question is do you have clarity on that it's going to be 9 to 12 months. If we knew it was going to be flat and weak for the next 9 to 12 months, we'd probably do one set of things. But if you're kind of making that decision quarter-to-quarter, you have a little bit less flexibility, obviously. But to answer your question, I think the good news is for the drive industry, or certainly, for Seagate, and I guess getting to be that way for WD and Hitachi, is for us, it's about absorbing heads and disks really. It's where most of our R&D and where most of our capital is deployed. And as long as we're absorbing heads and disks at these levels, we're okay. And if we had to reduce drive output, that's actually fairly easy capital for us to address, in part, because a lot of it is test capacity, which we can actually increase test times and also with aerial density -- sorry, with average capacity per drive increasing, test times are increasing anyhow. So in a certain sense, as challenging as the environment is, I'd say for the drive industry, given the aerial density and the petabyte growth, it's manageable. Now if TAMs dropped to 120 million units, that's a different story. Then the industry would probably have to take a hard look at a lot of things with respect to internal components and supply, as well as drive level capacity. But I'd say right now for us, while we're operating well below our theoretical capacity, we can maintain the margin structures and the cost objectives that we have at this level of demand, even if it lasted 9 or 12 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Steve, two if I could. I guess the first one is regarding the gross margin and ASP guidance in December quarter. I guess I was thinking, if prices were coming down about 5%, that gross margins would be able to be stable, more or less. I mean is that just -- sort of typically, not the right sort of assumption? Or is there something going on with mix that's baked into that -- to the gross margin guidance as well? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, like I said, I think we've been pretty conservative on mix. But again, price erosion is a tricky little term in the drive industry that's, unfortunately, got a legacy that went back to when there was only about 5 different products as opposed to 700 different products. So we like to talk more in terms of ASPs. So you're generally right though that if it was a 5% price erosion that the ASPs probably wouldn't erode by 5%, and gross margins would be healthier. So price erosion is higher than 5%, ASP erosion will be about 5%. And if mix improves either within each category, right -- mix meaning capacity per drive, if you will, or heads and disks per drive, or if the mix improves in terms of enterprise nearline versus client, notebook and desktop, those are all things obviously that boost ASPs. We've taken a pretty conservative approach, as I said on the enterprise market opportunity, in part because of the inventory and in part because of European concerns.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","And just as a follow-up, you've been pretty consistent or very consistent, I should say, on capital allocation through this calendar year. Can you give us some sense of what capital allocation could look like as we get into '13? I believe you have some stipulations around some NOLs. So was interested in sort of getting your thoughts on how that might impact any of the capital allocation.","Stephen J. Luczo","It doesn't change the long-term capital allocations, where we still believe that we're going to target a heavy return of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends or redemption. And of course, we've got the 2014 end of year target of $250 million ordinary shares outstanding. So what happens in 2013 though, as you pointed out, is we do run into a Section 382 problem where, if we redeem too many shares, it could trigger a loss of our NOLs, which are fairly substantial. And we'd rather avoid doing that, not that we've used NOLs or necessarily see any need to use NOLs. But it's nice to have them in case you need them. So we'll probably be reasonable in sidestepping that problem, unless the value proposition is just too great, in which case, obviously then, we'll go ahead and buy our stock and deal with losing NOLs that we may or may not need. So what that would mean obviously is a slowdown in redemption in 2013 and then an acceleration in 2014 to get to our target. And in the meantime, obviously, maintaining our dividend policy, which is, as we said, a minimum increase, targeted increase of 10% per year.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Got it. Is there any sort of level that we should expect the redemptions to sort of settle in at as we get into '13?","Stephen J. Luczo","They're pretty minimal for '13.","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","It's really for 9 months of '13. In the December quarter of 2013, some of the limitations ease. But for the remainder, the first 9 months of calendar 2013, they will be pretty minimal.","Stephen J. Luczo","The only thing that can also change that is there are certain holders of securities that we can buy from and not trigger a 382 problem, if you will. Not to imply that anything our government does to us is a problem. But one of those would be Samsung. So if Samsung decided to sell any shares, we could acquire from Samsung and not run into a 382 problem. There are also a couple of institutional holders that we can buy shares from and also not trigger it. So we have a couple other options, but we'll just have to see how it unfolds.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I appreciate the detail on the hybrid drive progress. I know you mentioned the 5-millimeter and the 7-millimeter being in the process of being qualified with some OEMs. Can you give us an update on where you are with hybrids? Have you shipped any into new products, or is this really more of a 2013 thing?","Stephen J. Luczo","It's calendar 2013. So I think by the end of this calendar year, we're going to have hybrid offerings; CTU level, at least, with a lot of major customers, so that would, Sherri, include desktop and enterprise. The 7-millimeter hybrid's getting a lot of attention, which would be a drive that would be used in thin and light. 5-millimeter is not a hybrid, the first version, that would be later. But we think there's lots of interesting applications for 5-millimeter regardless. And I'd say where I'm most excited is the attention that the hybrid in enterprise is getting at a couple of accounts, because you basically can boost IOPS performance by 2x to 3x, which in a lot of applications, IOPS is the measure that they're most concerned about. So we have a couple of large enterprise customers that are very interested in the product, and that's probably the one I'm most excited about. So that's all stuff that we would expect to be ramping in calendar 2013, but some of those even in the first half.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just a quick question on share count. I think the share count was a bit different this quarter than, at least, we had expected. What is the assumption for share count in the December quarter? I know you've given a 350 million by the end of the year, but what type of average should we use for the quarter?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","I'd use 390 million shares. That may be slightly conservative, depending on the pace we buy to get to 350, but I'd plan for that, Sherri.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two if I can. I just want go back to the March discussion. Understanding that you are going to be more disciplined relative to December on pricing, is your assumption also, as we work through this OEM inventory that -- what's your assumption around the industry demand TAM or the shipment numbers going into the March quarter? Are we to assume a flat sequential TAM, or do we expect -- I think it's hard to try and judge what normal seasonality is anymore?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, I mean flat. I mean people can get all hung up on 10 million units these days. But the reality is, 10 million units, when you think about our 42% market share, is 4 million units, which I think we could probably respond to in about 1.5 days, so it's not a big deal, right? Whether or not I say 140 or 150, while some analysts may get all exercised about that, the reality is it's the same number from an operations perspective. So I would assume a flat TAM, whether or not that means 140 or even 155, I think is possible. Like I said, I think the December system sales will probably actually be up. My guess is 3% to 7%, but I think we're not going to see it just because of inventory absorption. So that may mean real TAM for December, in terms of sales out of systems in the 150 range, in which case, then March probably, for us, sales will be like that. So that's what we're assuming, but it doesn't really matter. The point is, capacity is way above that. Capacity is 170, so you're not going to pick up anything. You're not going to pick up 30 million units with pricing. The issue is not pricing of systems. The issue is macroeconomic conditions. So the TAM's 140. We'll build whatever it is, 56 million drives, and we're going to price them so we can maintain the margins that we need to invest in our business long term.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Very helpful. And as a follow-up, you guys had the Analyst Day on September 21. You talked about roughly a 30% gross margin. I'd like to understand, I know it's just a week or so left in the quarter, what changed relative to that? I think you also had made a comment about Brazil having 100 basis points impact. I don't know if that was really the driver. I'd like to understand why that changed in the final week or so of the quarter.","Stephen J. Luczo","Sure. I don't know if you had heard the earlier comments that I made, but the quarter was really back-end loaded, much more so than -- more so than even is typical for a September. And September's a pretty back-end loaded quarter anyhow as you know. July is usually very weak, August is weak, almost through the entire month. And then it's this race to the finish, and it was even more seasonally back-end loaded. So we had a lot of drives to ship. We looked at historical seasonality, and basically, the quarter didn't come through. So part of it was just related to the overall weakness in demand that basically never really kind of resolved itself.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The Brazil issue?","Stephen J. Luczo","So part of it was mix. Again, enterprise mix at the end didn't come in where we thought it would. So again, we have a lot of historical data about what happens with enterprise shipments through the quarter. They're typically even more back-end loaded than client. And so they didn't resolve as much, and the mix wasn't as good. So that was the second thing. And then you have Brazil was like 100 basis points. So I mean even with the first 2 items, we would have hit the 30%, if it wasn't for the Brazil issue. And that was basically a function of -- it's a fairly complicated story. But in Brazil, there is a requirement that if you are building computer systems in Brazil, a certain number or a certain percentage of the components have to be purchased in-country. And we've invested a fair amount of money, in part, as an extension of the investments that Samsung had to make sure that we can actually provide in-country-built drives. Our estimation of what that business should have been in the last couple of quarters was high, and we're still digging into why that is. But as a result, the pricing that we deployed was too aggressive because we didn't get the absorption that we should have. So we've made the adjustments in terms of our expectations. We'll make adjustments in terms of pricing. And we won't get all of that 100 basis points back next quarter, but we think -- this quarter, but we'll probably get half of it back, and then we should kind of be through that knothole [ph].","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering 2 things. You said OpEx is going to be up sequentially slightly. I was wondering how you were thinking about that lever. I think you mentioned that you didn't want to cut product development, but if things were to get particularly difficult, what are you thinking about the OpEx  lever, and what could you do? And I have a follow-up.","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, we could do a lot on OpEx, as you know, Ben. I think the only thing that's really driving -- and that would again be if we had a forecast of a sustained environment that's a lot worse than this. Again, I'm not going to cut OpEx when we're running at margin levels, like I said, that are higher than what the high end of our old range was. If this is what bad is, we can live with it and continue to invest. The biggest thing driving the increase in the OpEx right now is we hadn't done a focal increase really for a couple of years. And so we're doing a focal increase on comp. And the second is LaCie acquisition brings some OpEx into the model that wasn't there previously. So we know how to manage OpEx if things get bad and stay bad, but I don't think we're near that right now. But we do planning all the time.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My follow-up is on enterprise. Within your TAM estimate, I think you're saying there's continued pressure into the fourth quarter. And just within enterprise, if you wouldn't mind, what are you seeing into December and then into March in terms of TAM? And how we balance the inventories there, just in enterprise, in particular?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, again, we're maintaining a pretty conservative outlook in December and March. Our issue around enterprise, or I think, the technology industry's issue around enterprise is, in my opinion, more related to European situation and weakness in economy just because Europe plays a big role in enterprise purchases, as do governments. And there's obviously more and more policies around austerity, which ultimately means fewer purchases by government. So I think we're just being conservative, there's not going to be much of a recovery, Ben, for a couple of quarters.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it's like in line with your TAM estimate, just flat and flat kind of is best guess for now?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, that's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about, Steve, your comment on balancing supply and demand, strong inventory management and gross margin performance relative to pre-consolidation, especially considering linearity. If you can talk about balancing supply with these conditions, it just seems like Seagate and the industry are more nimble today.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, well, I think Seagate is. I mean if you look at our inventory position, I think it's -- to have less inventory than we did in June, in a quarter that fell off pretty dramatically relative to expectations, I feel that the company responded pretty well. I think linearity is a different issue. I think -- I still think that we and our customers have a lot of work to do around linearity and velocity. And Dave Mosley can talk just a little bit, with Rocky. I mean we're doing a lot of -- it's funny. The flood, for all of its challenges, also, I think, resulted in some really good business process improvements between us and our customers in order to reduce inventory and increase velocity. Some customers are continuing with that. Others are going back to their lazy ways that basically somehow revolve around carrying a lot of inventory to solve business process problems. And I just don't think that's healthy. I think our industry's got to address that with our customers that at the end of the day, that's not good for anybody. So the only way we can really do that is keeping a really tight control on builds. Dave's done a lot of work in this area on the supply chain side, all the way through demand fulfillment. So maybe I'll just ask him to talk to you a little bit, and then Rocky can weigh in on what he's seeing on the customer side in terms of those that are kind of moving towards a model that is maybe more focused on velocity versus inventory.","William David Mosley","First of all, product simplification happens, which we've been working really hard, especially through the product transitions that we went through. That helps it straight out of the factories. And then working with our customers to develop hubs that make sense versus hubs that are spread all over the place where we can late-stage postpone some of the configuration issues that they need out the field. With product simplification, that's helping us quite a bit. And then once you get those hubs set up, you can take advantage of [indiscernible]. So I think there's a lot of things that we're doing around that, working with some of the customers that have really kind of come to the table after the flood that Steve talked about that's really paying good benefits efficiency wise. Rocky?","Albert A. Pimentel","And I think that cross-functionally, Dave and I working together on the business process, I think on the sales side, the management of customers' week-to-week demand and polls, et cetera, we've made a lot of improvements to really get down and focused on those key customers that really move the needle. And working with manufacturing, I think we've really improved the business process of the supply chain with the customers and holding the customers accountable for their commitments. And I think it's resulted in that efficiency you've seen in inventory. It's a continued battle every week-to-week in the volatility to the market we're in. But I think that, again, we made some really fundamental advancements in our cross-functional management of the supply chain through customer fulfillment.","Stephen J. Luczo","And we just have to be more disciplined. One of the things we're doing internally, Jayson, is we're actually changing our sales comp programs to be rewarded on basically, forecast accuracy and linearity, which is not something that typically we had done, not certainly at the level or priority that we're going to do it now. And the other again is just working with customers. I mean we had a customer last week that made a big change order on enterprise from one product to another. And we try to explain to them why that was difficult. And the response was, well, it's just a mix change. As if you just wave a wand over these drives and somehow make them something different. So it's just a different dialogue that has to occur that look, if you order one of these things, then we're building it for you and you're buying it. And if you're not, then there's going to be a penalty associated to it, not that we'll just swap these things out, like you can go to the hardware store and decide you want 1\/4 inch screws instead of 3\/8. So a lot of work the industry has to do, I think, to got the right discipline in.","Operator","Our final question comes from Cindy Shaw from DISCERN.","Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","I've been hearing from some of my industry contacts that they're seeing the enterprise systems ship with just less capacity of drives and more empty drive space. And we can speculate as to a number of reasons as to why that might be up -- going on. But I was wondering if you can comment on, are you seeing that? And if you are, what do you think might be behind it?","Stephen J. Luczo","I don't know that we're seeing that. But what I guess would be behind it is customers that hope that they can buy directly instead of buying racked-out systems that they're paying a huge markup on disk drives for. But I don't know that they can really do that, because if they're buying from OEMs, the OEMs really control that through their maintenance and service contracts. So you can't really buy a system and then buy drives from Seagate if you're buying a system from a traditional OEM because then your service contract typically is invalidated. So no one's willing to do that. So we haven't really seen that. But I do think that if you weren't talking about OEMs, I mean, I do think, architecturally, that's happening, that people are starting to design systems where they can incrementally add the storage they need. If those aren't really necessarily through the OEMs. I think it's -- that's more some of the new architectures.","All right. Well, on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our employees and customers and partner suppliers and shareholders for your support and commitment, and best of luck to everyone on the East Coast as you recover from the storm.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Seagate demonstrated strong operational performance in the June quarter, achieving revenues of $3.3 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $370 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.10.","We had another strong cash flow quarter generating $577 million in operating cash flow and $446 million in free cash flow. Full-year fiscal 2014 revenues were $13.7 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, we achieved gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $1.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $5.04.","Operating cash flow generated for the fiscal year was over $2.5 billion and free cash flow was approximately $2 billion.","We exceeded our shareholder capital return goals for the year, returning $2.5 billion in the form of dividends and share redemptions to our shareholders. We ended the fiscal year with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments, and $327 million ordinary shares outstanding.","One of our strategic priorities for fiscal year 2014 was to further optimize Seagate's capital structure to support the long-term growth of the company. Over the course of the fiscal year, we successfully raised $1.8 billion in investment grade debt while retiring $700 million. These actions decreased our weighted average interest rate to 5% and extended our debt maturity profile out to 2025.","We continue to be focused on making investments and acquisitions to build out Seagate's storage offering, enter new market adjacencies and expand our core technical capabilities. The first quarter for our Cloud Systems and Solutions business, which includes the OneStor systems, ClusterStor and Evolve product lines was strong and we exceeded our internal revenue plan.","The traction we are achieving with existing and new customers is encouraging and we believe this momentum will create new revenue opportunities in the future.","At the end of May, we announced our plan to acquire the SSD controller and PCIe assets from Avago, to further build out our integrated flash technology portfolio, expand our customer base, and drive new revenue opportunities. The transaction is on track to close at the end of August or beginning of September and we look forward to talking more broadly about our strategic plans post-close.","Our fiscal year capital expenditures were $559 million below our long-term planning range of 6% to 8% of revenue. We continue to plan cautiously and focus on deploying capital towards the maintenance of our existing operation, increase technical R&D capabilities, and improvements to our global facilities footprint.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2015 and beyond, the significant changes and economics and architectures taking place in the traditional storage industry continued to create opportunities for Seagate. As we plan for our next fiscal year, we remain focused on investing in our storage technology product portfolio to deliver high quality storage products and solutions that create advantages for our customers.","Some of these investments will have immediate benefit to our business, while others will take more time, but we believe will create important strategic advantages for Seagate in the storage marketplace.","As noted on our last call, we talked about demand momentum building towards the back-half of the year. Based on the June quarter activity and as a result of ongoing conversations with customers, we continued to see demand trends strengthening across multiple segments. This is the first time we've seen this kind of sustained traction during the last four years. In addition, while it is early in the quarter, we are seeing higher-than-normal pull rates for July and a significant increase in capacity for drive thus far.","Turning to our outlook, we believe market demand in September and December quarters are being driven by a few key factors, improving sequential momentum in the cloud market and the traditional enterprise market consistent with product refreshes, sequential strength in the notebook market, and seasonal demand for gaming and branded. Taking these factors into account, industry estimates are for market demand to be approximately 142 million units to 146 million units in the September quarter.","Given the current outlook for notebook demand, we anticipate the addressable market will be at the higher end of that range. In this demand environment, we believe Seagate's product portfolio is well positioned competitively. In the enterprise market, most of our major OEMs and cloud customers are qualified or are actively qualifying our 6 terabyte product. This product has many industry-leading features in terms of capacity, performance, and cost.","We have also delivered 8 terabyte customer development units to major customers and cloud service providers and the initial customer feedback has been very positive. While it\u2019s still early in the development of our Kinetic object-based storage platform, we are in deep technical discussions with a very broad-base of enterprise customers. We believe our focus on developing key values for object-based storage will make the Kinetic platform a differentiated offering in the cloud storage marketplace.","In conjunction with improving dynamics in the client market, we have been focusing on optimizing our client product portfolio and reinforcing our competitive position. This past quarter we finished qualification of our 7200 RPM notebook product at all major OEMs, and we expect to quickly ramp volume in this critical space and win share that is in line with our segment averages.","We are encouraged by the adoption we are achieving with key OEMs for our hybrid drives and the top three worldwide PC manufacturers now offer our hard drive in their mainstream product lines. We have seen a significant acceleration in demand and plan to ship over 2.5 million hybrid drives in the September quarter.","And finally, we expect to maintain share in the gaming market and have a fully refreshed portfolio for the branded space for Seagate and LaCie products. Based on industry forecast at this time in the quarter and the competitive positioning of our product portfolio, we are planning to achieve revenue of at least $3.55 billion in the September quarter. We are targeting product gross margins to be relatively flat, recognizing we have margin pressure associated with the integration of Xyratex and the Avago flash technology assets.","Operating expenses will be approximately $550 million, slightly above our long-term targeted range of 12% to 14%. We are planning for our core businesses expense to be relatively flat and approximately $35 million in one-time expenses from our planned 14-week quarter and other charges.","In summary, Seagate is very well positioned for continued success and while our forecasting continues to maintain a sense of caution due to macroeconomic conditions and industry dynamics, the trends we are seeing in the marketplace are continuing to align with our long-term expectations for exabyte demand and the growing need for economical and efficient storage.","We are optimistic about our storage technology leadership position and we look forward to updating you on our vision and strategic plan at our strategic update on September 12. On behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank our employees for meeting our operational goals for the fiscal year and positioning Seagate for ongoing success in fiscal year 2015.","I also want to thank our customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders for their continued support and commitment.","And we can now turn it over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research","Yes, thanks, good afternoon. There is still some debate in the market around the sustainability of PC strength post Win XP. And I think your comments in the back-half you mentioned cloud and notebooks and gaming, but not desktops. So can you just talk about what you've seen in July around commercial desktop and whether that strength is continuing?","Stephen Luczo","I think it's early, Katy, but I mean what we are seeing right now is strength across all the segments.","Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research","Okay. And then as it relates to the constructive comments on the back-half, what do you think is driving that, is that just global improvement in macro, is that catch-up in capacity, demand as data has grown and orders have not over the last year, just curious what you think is driving the strength?","Stephen Luczo","I would say most of our customers would attribute it to just general macroeconomic strength. I do think there is, as we said, these changes between the deployment of storage and the demand for storage and those can fluctuate based on either time to deployment or utilization rates, and those are going to constantly flux over the period of years or quarters. But right now, I think the strength is being driven by macroeconomic factors.","Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research","Okay. And then just lastly given the potential for better fundamentals in the back half, what should we expect on the buyback in the first-half of fiscal 2015?","Stephen Luczo","We'll talk about our capital allocation plan at the strategic update in September.","Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley Equity Research","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen Luczo","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions; one, maybe you can just talk a little bit on the Enterprise Drives, what do you expect in the back half between the mission critical and the capacity-optimized drives? Do you expect both of them to see robust trend? Is one better than the other?","Stephen Luczo","Yes, Rock, you answer that.","Albert Pimentel","Yes, this is Rocky Pimentel. So, on the enterprise side, we expect consistent improvement based on our OEM customers anecdotal and forecasted data. On the cloud side, I think our anticipation is the capacity driven products going more into the cloud side and we see probably a stronger sentiment in the cloud side as we go through the remainder of the back half of the year.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And if I can just clarify the second part, the $550 million of OpEx that you guys are talking about for the upcoming quarter. $35 million of that is related to extra weeks or extra, how should we think about $550 million run rate on a quarterly basis go forward?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","It's $35 million and other \u2013 this is Pat, I'm sorry, this is Pat. These $35 million and other charges whether it's integration and other activities as we try to knit the companies together. But above that $22 million to $25 million is going to be the 14th week, so you can't attribute all the 14th week, but it's that plus other things, is that $35 million one-time disappears after Q1.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And is that\u2026","Stephen Luczo","And then at the \u2013 and at the Strategic Update, we'll provide a better annual and quarterly outlook on OpEx, because these will be two quarters and on the Xyratex business and kind of a couple of months and at least on the knowledge of what other side looks like. So, we're going to give you more transparency about what the overall OpEx looks like at that time.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And I guess, Pat, just to clarify this thing of the extra week, is that a net neutral or bit of a drag to your operating margin and EPS?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","","It's a good question. I've been around this business a long time. This is probably my fifth cycle, 14 weeks. We certainly expect to get some marginal uplift on that 14th week, but the way OEMs negotiate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, you can have some debate on that. There's not too much debate on the OpEx or the other costs and they're fixed and we know those, so \u2013 but we've modeled it.","Stephen Luczo","","It's a net negative on operating margin to answer your question, because you get the full week of expenses obviously. But you don't get a 1\/14th increase in revenues, because the OEMs don't, they just negotiate quarterly and as you know we're heavily weighted towards OEM. So you get a revenue pick-up, but you don\u2019t get a 1\/14th revenue pick-up, but you certainly get a 1\/14th operating expense pick-up, so\u2026","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","That's helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. So, I wanted to ask more of a longer-term strategy question, and more specifically to the NAS market, and obviously, you announced some products and, I wanted to ask that question, because the Soho market that you're targeting, it appears to be fairly sizeable. I mean there's, I think over 5 million firms just in the U.S. with 20 employees or less. So, and also your major storage customers don't really participate in that market. So could you help us, maybe, size that opportunity and, and how soon it could become a meaningful contributor to the P&L?","Stephen Luczo","I think the key to it being a significant contributor to the P&L revolves around software. I think still to-date, the main inhibitor to that market really achieving its full potential is that the software is difficult to use. And it's an area where we've been making investments and are trying to solve that problem. But to your point, the market is attractive. I want to say, shouldn't guessed at this, but I want to say this is $1 billion market or something like that when you take all the companies that we know and then hear about often and then maybe some of, what goes through integration.","I think the difficult part is, what goes through the VAR channel and SI channel that ends up being a NAS product, we lose visibility on things like that. But I do think that this is a substantial market that likes the DAS market as the drive industry started delivering more integrated products with software and hardware that, that's opportunity for us on the NAS side.","And again, our distribution channel really knows how to reach into VARs and SIs that have storage expertise, so I do think it's a potential but and so the software gets a little easier to use. I don't think it's going to be as addressable as it probably should be.","Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup","Got it. Thank you, Steve, for the color. And Dave, I believe in the past you talked about various cost levers like scrap, warranty, and freight, and where do you see opportunities in the second half to maybe further optimize costs?","Dave Mosley","I think we'll continue to pull those levers as much as we possibly can. There are some product transitions going on, for example, the 6 terabyte and things like that. So, as we get up the initial ramp and then are able to get our yields up and work those issues, we can continue to take costs out. So I think products transitions and more efficient use of internal components, high number, high component counts that cover fixed costs, things like that. There's a lot of opportunity there.","Also there are some synergies that we get from some of the acquisition stuff that we've done like, for example, Xyratex, making the supply chain flow better up and down. I think there will be some cost opportunities there as well.","Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe Wittine \u2013 Longbow Research","Hi, thanks. If you're willing to, just a question on the rationale behind the LSI acquisition, I think the WarpDrive piece, the PCIe is self-explanatory, get you closer to the hyperscale guys. But I really want to ask you on the core SandForce, the standard FSPs. I know the standard control is typically focused on kind of the channel SSD and replacement SSD market, so just curious, any quick thoughts of how that second piece is complementary to Seagate?","Dave Mosley","Yes, first of all, we have a lot of controllers ourselves. Every hard drive has a controller as well. So there's complementary technology development that's going on that can be used back and forth. But I think germane to just how do you go to market if you will. The knowledge that you get from integrating with the various customers is pretty powerful. And I think insofar as those are the same customers that we're doing, we are going out and talking to with hard drives. I think there is and we understand the market segments really well and we can address both spaces. I think that's fairly powerful also.","The \u2013 I think everybody needs to keep in mind that this is really a flash controller. The interface side, we have a lot of expertise in anyway, whether it's SAS or SATA or something else, and then some of those can plug into your point about the PCIe cards we can also plug those in to that interfacing and go to market that way. But the NAND control piece is something obviously we've been doing a lot on for our hybrid drives.","Steve talked about how that market's growing quite a bit, so I think there's a lot of synergies there, I hope that answers your question.","Joe Wittine \u2013 Longbow Research","Great, thanks. And then switch gears to branded quickly, you said, you have some work to do on the, on product introductions coming up here. I don't know if you can give any more details there. And second, what is the reasonable expectation of kind of go-forward unit growth for brand? And I only asked, because your units grew only a point last year. I know Toshiba kind of aggressively grabs some share early in the year, which didn't help. But if you can give us your updated thoughts on what the long-term, mid-term secular growth rates is here?","Albert Pimentel","Yes, this is Rocky Pimentel. So, I think we're still looking at a single unit direct-attached storage market for branded for the next couple of quarters that being the dominant product. But like Steve talked about, that the \u2013 today that the branded has pretty much serviced the small home office type category of products and then demands. But I think as we see our product's roadmap over the next 18 to 24 quarters, we'll start to be introducing additional more complex products in the NAS, with a focus on the user experience and the software offering.","So we totally recognize the opportunity as the segmentation between traditional \u2013 between real consumer and true small business emerges that \u2013 it's an opportunity for us to continue to offer low-end complex NAS storage to that segment.","Stephen Luczo","I think a lot of that where the real research on the market side, and Jamie can lean on this as well as this line between prosumer to small business to medium business, and which of those segments you are going to be serviced through HTDs through cloud offerings, whether or not it's an AWS-type solution or a hybrid solution where there is local storage as well as some cloud-based storage.","And so we are working on our architectures that, in partnership with some of our cloud customers there is utilizations where by having a hybrid product, non-prime storage, as well as cloud-based has some overall advantages either in terms of security or cost or bandwidth. So I think how that flushes out and which one of those kind of sub-segments you are talking about will have well different offers. But that notwithstanding, that animal that is a pure NAS product for a lower-end less technically confident customer, the software has to get a lot easier.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, thank you. I think you kind of dovetailed a little bit with the comments that you just made. Can you talk a little bit more about your Xyratex business and in particular your ability to position a solution sale into the cloud opportunities? Has that started to materialize? How much was the Xyratex revenue contribution this last quarter relative to the $100 million? And maybe talk about how we should think about the trajectory of that opportunity going forward?","Stephen Luczo","Jamie, do you want to handle it?","Jamie Lerner","Hey, Aaron, this is Jamie. Maybe I'll take a moment and highlight some of the accomplishments this quarter. ClusterStor which is our high performance computing business is gaining a significant amount of traction in the oil and gas and healthcare verticals especially genomic sequencing as well as seeing a lot of strength in the government sector for immense big data deployments.","Aaron, to give you an idea of the scale these projects, our team closed a 65 petabyte, 3-petaflop deal with a European weather service, as well as we recently won a 82 petabyte deal in partnership with Cray, that's delivering 1.7 terabytes per second for immense data processing to the U.S. government.","Of the Fortune Five, two of those oil and gas companies are using ClusterStor for their exploration and geospatial analytics. Now, for the cloud-scale folks that you talked about as a sign of that pipeline, we are responding to a 0.5 zettabyte and a full zettabyte storage opportunity for the world's largest cloud storage operators.","Few other points that are worth mentioning is also with ClusterStor we have an item called the Secure Data Appliance, which is the world's fastest data analytics engine. And this product achieved the Intelligence Community Directive, ICD 503 this quarter. And for those you don't know what that is, this is a group that oversees the analytics work for the Intelligence Community and has certified us for the world's most secure data projects for the U.S. Intelligence Community.","In addition, that ClusterStor business grew at over 210% this quarter. The Evolve business had its largest quarter in the last 10 years was \u2013 we have five deals that were over $500,000, so we are seeing the average sale price go up as we are able to, and working with Xyratex, meet the needs of much larger organizations. And in our OSS and OEM business which a lot of cloud providers are saying, will you actually build a custom box for us. We saw for the first time in over 10 quarters, that bookings were significantly ahead of revenue in that business, so all three businesses over-performed this quarter.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Right. And so when I think about that opportunity or that business trajectory materializing and considering that you are stripping out the pass-through effect of what Xyratex would have been historically selling on hard disk drive content. How do I think about the margin profile and how that could progress and play into the Seagate story? And I'll cede the floor.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","So let me take that Aaron, this is Pat, and if Jamie wants to add color, please, Jamie, add more color. But when we made the acquisition we knew it was the \u2013 the first thing, we were going to stabilize the asset and I think what you're hearing from Jamie is, we stabilize it and start reinvigorate the product lines, that's the good thing.","As we go through the fiscal year, we really, the only thing we really said was the revenue would be $500 million to $600 million. I can tell you here we'll probably get more color, but we really don\u2019t want to break this business out, so it gets about $1 billion, but with that $500 million to $600 million, like I said, we are trending in the high part of that, but it won't be accretive during the first fiscal year, but it will thereafter.","I think the margins have a slight drag, but should trajectory through the course of the year get equal to and above. So we like the path, but there is a bit of reinvigorating that product line to drive that and Jamie stabilizing the existing and growing with the new.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Very good. Thank you.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. First of all, could you just expand on your comments about the significant increase in average capacities that you are expecting for the second half of the year, where exactly you're seeing it, what's driving it from the customer-end?","And then secondly, can you help us put the 8% growth in exabytes versus the 4% decline year-over-year in revenues, what's making up the difference there? Thanks.","Stephen Luczo","Well, on the growth thus far, it's just \u2013 we're just using an average capacity for drive across the board, which is \u2013 from where it\u2019s been the last several quarters and that\u2019s across all customers. And we are not going to talk about customer specific or market specific.","Unidentified Company Representative","Clearly the high capacity drives are getting higher capacity and lower-end drives are going up in capacity, so there is multiple drivers driving the average size of the drive sold up.","Stephen Luczo","What's driving it is richer content and more people needing access to richer content.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","And data, right.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Okay. And then just putting the\u2026","Stephen Luczo","Would you restate the second half of the question?","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Yes, I think you said in your prepared remarks that exabyte growth was up 8% year-over-year for the quarter, your revenues were down 4% year-over-year, so how would we split between the two?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","I think as we highlight the back-half of the year, where the cloud was somewhat muted, where they're the richest drives. We saw the average capacity of drive go up, but we saw as we talked about in the last two quarters, where we had some whether it\u2019s enterprise or cloud that was somewhat muted, we see that accelerating. So what we saw were growth in a lot of the \u2013 in the notebook drives, which are per unit, a lot lower capacity, but that even as those units go out, their capacity for drive is increasing.","So I think you have to look at the whole portfolio, but if you look at it individually you will see an increase of every drive capacity across the board. So every segments getting richer, it\u2019s just the mix that's sort of covering that story up.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Thank you.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks. Just going back to the Xyratex revenue question, I think you had said in this quarter, you thought that revenue would be about a $100 million in this quarter. It sounds like you guys think that it was higher than that based on the $500 million to $600 million annual revenue run-rate at this point, is that fair?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","Yes, that's fair. Like I said, we're not breaking it out and until we get to a significant more scale, but that's probably a fair assessment.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just looking at the guidance for $3.55 billion, am I \u2013 is it fair to assume that you are not including any revenue benefit from the fourth quarter, I'm sorry the extra week in the quarter?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","We're some marginal, but not, as Steve says, it's not a 1\/14, it\u2019s very small.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just looking at your guidance versus the TAM guidance, it looks like revenue is going to be up at the midpoint about 8% versus units up maybe 6% to 7%, is that because of better mix, why do you expect the ASPs to go up? Thanks.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","That's all mix, as we talked about in the last call, where we see the strengthening in the back-half of the enterprise and the cloud, classic enterprise and cloud, that's being fuelled by that, and it's also being fuelled by richer content of richer of mix up of every segment drive.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. Actually just taking on the last comment, Pat, what do you think \u2013 in terms of pricing dynamics in the retail segments, are you expecting prices to go up there as well? And then I have a follow-up.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","","If I look at the whole portfolio, it\u2019s relatively benign. It has been relatively benign for a while. We expect it to stay that way. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not a company that place quarter-end deals. We sure just \u2013 we run a long-term business model and we expect pricing to be relatively stable, what we\u2019ve seen over the last year.","Stephen Luczo","","And when you say retail, Richard, are you talking about branded?","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","","Yes.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","","So we don\u2019t see price rises, but we see relatively price stability.","","Stephen Luczo","","I\u2019d say that the price competition has been less aggressive than it was earlier in the year.","Albert Pimentel","","Yes, and I would say, this is Rocky Pimentel, where we see a benefit of mixing up of capacities in the retail portfolio, strength in the one terabyte, two terabyte offerings, and as we continue to go out over the next few quarters, so certainly that\u2019s going to be positive impact to the retail business across the industry basically.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","","Okay, and secondly on the margins, as you look at the balance of the year taken into account Avago and what you\u2019re doing with the Xyratex business, do you think that there\u2019s greater leverage on the gross margin side or on the operating margin side?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","For the fiscal year, I think we have more leverage on the gross margin, the operating leverage will be a little more difficult during fiscal 2015 until we get to scale and as we knit these companies together to get more efficiencies as Dave highlighted on the supply chain as we look at all the facilities, we got to knit those in but that\u2019s going to be the challenge if you want to think of it that way for us in fiscal 2015 to set up a good 2016.","But the gross margin leverage I think we\u2019re going to have tools to optimize that better than the operating for the first 12 months.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","","Okay and then just lastly, Steve, you mentioned that for the first time in four years, you\u2019re starting to see a little bit better demand and visibility out of the OEMs. I\u2019m just interested, are you seeing any changes in behavior regarding inventory or hubs or how they want to manage the business this time around or do you think you can maintain the same supply demand discipline that\u2019s been in place for few years?","","Stephen Luczo","","No, I didn\u2019t say OEMs, I said customers.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","For Customers.","","Stephen Luczo","","And I think I'll do a quick answer and then I\u2019ll let Dave talk on the operational side, which is really what you asked. But I would say across the customer base globally, there\u2019s a greater degree of confidence about what\u2019s ahead of us for the next four quarters than what I had felt anytime in the last \u2013 since the debacle of 2008 September. And we\u2019ve had a couple of starts before as I mentioned on the last call, but this is I think the first time that\u2019s actually sustained itself here at the end of the summer.","And I think that\u2019s encouraging and then in terms of the operational side, I think, things just continue to get better in terms of people understanding that as my friend, John Monroe says inventory is not an asset, Velocity is important. And therefore, lean supply chains are where people make money. But I\u2019ll let Dave talk to that because we\u2019ve made a lot of good progress with some of our key customers there. And in that case it has been mostly OEMs.","Dave Mosley","","Right, to that end, Rich, we\u2019ve had a lot of success optimizing freight lanes, using the right kind of freight, whether it\u2019s ocean or rail, not air, and using super hubs rather than individual jet-hubs [ph] for everybody, to do late stage postponement and things like that, that's really helped our inventory positions and that\u2019s helped by the fact that some of the big OEMs are working complexity across every segment.","They\u2019re doing a really good job there. We can always redeploy those drives out of the channel or whatnot if they don\u2019t have the demand and I think just in the last few years, that\u2019s been a market change in our industry. We just continue to work on that systems that enable that with our key partners.","Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","","Great, excellent. Thank you very much.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","","Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick \u2013 the market share was just a bit lower in the quarter, about 39 points, usually it\u2019s been 40% around, any particular reason or you think it\u2019s just quarter-over-quarter noise?","Stephen Luczo","No, I think it\u2019s quarter-to-quarter noise. Again, the industry still has competitively at the end of the quarter that Seagate tends not to participate in, and there\u2019s also big shifts on depending on where your relationship is with which gaming company and you are at in the cycle with that gaming company. You could see SharePoint moves off of a point. So half point moves are noise level to us. We believe we\u2019re going to win with good solid product execution, better performance, better reliability, and we\u2019re not worried about where the share is at these levels.","This is a revenue share, our exabyte share has been relatively flat for the last four or five quarters. And we really focus probably more right now on revenue share and exabyte share than we do on unit TAM share as long as we are getting enough absorption. Because of the shift, the higher capacity for drive that we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio, we\u2019re absorbing heads and disks and that\u2019s what we need to do.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Then just as a follow-up, Seagate currently uses much higher external media and head capacity. Do you think you will move more of it in-house, just maybe it could help the margins more?","Stephen Luczo","If we were really short-term focused that would be something we could do. But our thesis is that there will be long-term constraints in the supply of storage versus the demand of storage. And therefore, we believe the partnerships that we have with our head vendors and our disk vendors and other parts vendors will be well served over a longer-term view, where we can more efficiently use our capital and frankly more efficiently use our R&D dollars as we are with some of our partners right now.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","","All right. Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","Our next question \u2013 our last question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC","Hey, thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. Two, if I could. The first, Steve, is for you with regards to your comments around, I guess, 12-month visibility. I guess 12-month visibility has sort of increased demand to go along with the customer visibility there. Does that include your hyperscale customers? And I guess really what my question is, do we have maybe longer than a two-quarter deployment cycle here with hyperscale?","Stephen Luczo","Again, my comments were about what customers are seeing across the board in terms of the macro trends in the world and the confidence it gives them in their business models. You can\u2019t draw one to one correlations and what does that mean, this hyperscale customer or that hyperscale customer.","Every one of those companies that are providing public, cloud services are operating under different business models with different architectures, different applications, different deployment rates. So I\u2019d hate to paint a big broad stroke other than the general confidence level of people running technology companies or that are involved with the business of technology as strong as I\u2019ve seen it in four or five years.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC","Okay. Got it, guys, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is with regards to gross margins, you're forecasting flat gross margins, even with the cost load of the acquisition, which would suggest gross margins, I guess, up year-over-year without that load. And then I guess there was some commentary around having leverage through the year with regard to the acquisitions to get some gross margin leverage.","So my question is, we had a few quarters of year-over-year gross margin increases, sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, without the acquisitions, do you think we're in sort of an environment now where that kind of dynamic could more or less continue for the foreseeable future?","And then the second part is, given you have levers on gross margin from the acquisition, should we expect a little bit more expansion even on top of that over a reasonable period of time?","Stephen Luczo","We\u2019re going to talk about the long-term gross margin models in September. I think viewing the company without the acquisitions at this point is irrelevant. I think the trends are, again, that if the fundamental demand is towards higher capacity per drive, subject to a benign relatively, rational pricing environment, where we match supply and demand closely and don\u2019t do silly things to, take a point of share for no obvious reason.","Then yes, the general margin structure improves from the industry, but it has to. For us to hit the demand profiles that we see out in 2016 or 2017, we will not be able to do it on capital to revenue of 6% to 8%, and I don\u2019t think, we're going to be able to do it on 28 points of gross margin. I mean we just \u2013 to deploy the amount of capacity that we have to, to hit the multiple zettabytes of demand out in 2017 or 2018, we\u2019re going to have to establish more consistent business models. So if it isn\u2019t moving in that direction, the industry is going to be even more challenged.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC","Got it.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen J. Luczo","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Seagate\u2019s second quarter results reflect strong operational performance as we continue to manage through a challenging demand environment. For the December quarter, we achieved revenues of $3.7 billion, non-GAAP net income of $525 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38.","We generated $844 million in operating cash flow and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends. In December, we raised our quarterly dividend 19%, and in the first half of fiscal 2013, Seagate has returned over 95% of operating cash flow and over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.","Our business environment continues to be impacted by a wide range of macroeconomic, spending and demand challenges. Industry shipments declined 3% sequentially in the December quarter to approximately 135 million units. This decline was primarily driven by the notebook market as all other segments demonstrated quarter-over-quarter growth.","The overall industry demand environment was slightly lower than what we had expected. By executing effectively in response to in quarter upsides from our customers, our market share grew to near the higher end of our market share expectations.","We effectively balance supply and demand with finished goods inventory levels decreasing over 10% from the prior quarter. For the December quarter, we shipped over 47 exabytes of storage with an average of approximately 823 gigabytes per drive. This reflects a 59% year-over-year exabyte growth, which is well over twice the current rate of areal density growth.","Gross margins for the December quarter were 27.6% within both our expectations and our long-term margin range target. The pricing environment and the benefit we\u2019ve received from cost improvements from product transitions were also within the expected ranges for the quarter. Product mix improved slightly in the quarter.","Operating expenses in the December quarter were $437 million, including a $21 million benefit from legal costs reimbursements. We are focused on effectively aligning our operating expense to support a broader product portfolio of storage devices, including hybrid and solid state drives, software, other devices, and services. We believe these additional investments will support our continued leadership in the storage market and effectively align us with the rapid advancements in mobility, cloud, and open source initiatives.","We also continue to make strategic investments that position us for the future success in new storage applications. As an example, today we announced the strategic relationship with Virident Systems Inc., a performance leader in flash-based storage-class memory solutions. The company\u2019s plan to jointly deliver solutions for the fast growing PCIe storage market and most immediately, we will offer a complete line of flash-based PCIe solutions to our OEM and distribution partners, powered by Virident.","Longer term, we plan to jointly create next generation hardware and software solutions for the solid state storage market. We also made an strategic equity investment in Virident. Virident products are highly regarded for their industry leading performance, reliability and capacity. This is another example that accelerates our strategy to offer our customers a complete line of solid state products across all markets.","Now I\u2019ll provide our view for the March quarter and some context related to our outlook. Based on current planning indications from a broad base of customers and our assessment of the global macro economic conditions, we are continuing to manage our business cautiously. While customer demand visibility remains challenging, we expect the industry to continue to balance supply effectively and maintain relatively stable pricing.","For the March quarter, unit shipments in the first few weeks of the month of January have been linear and have trended higher than the beginning of the December quarter. Our outlook reflects an addressable market that is flat to down sequentially, and we are currently forecasting March quarter revenues of approximately $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion.","We continue to focus on the quality of our business versus absolute unit shipments. And at the low end of our revenue guidance, we have a conservative view of in quarter upsides. We expect to maintain gross margins at the lower end of our long term range of 27% to 32%.","Seagate remains focus on sustaining profitability in the current demand environment and investing to continue to be a storage leader. We are targeting non-GAAP operating expenses to be relatively flat sequentially, which should then directionally decline in the June quarter.","As we\u2019ve said over the last few quarters, Seagate is maintaining capital expenditures to meet narrow term demand signals as opposed to deploying capital and anticipation of our recovery of demand. The vast majority of our capital expenditures continue to be used for maintaining our existing operations and our current technology transitions. We expect to maintain capital spending at or below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.","In light of the gap between areal density growth and petabyte growth and the resultant upward pressure this puts on average capacity per drive shipped. We believe that this approach to capital provide support for our long-term gross margin expectations.","Delivering value to our shareholders continues be an important objective with Seagate. Through the share redemptions we have made this fiscal year and through our quarterly dividends, we are on track to return approximately 70% of operating cash flow and 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2013.","The next few years in the storage industry will present new and significant opportunities for Seagate. Data consumption and creation, along with the increase of global internet connectivity continue to drive petabyte growth at rates that are significantly greater than the areal density growth rate.","At the same time, open source software, cloud infrastructure and architectures, and mobility are fundamentally reducing the overall cost of computing and extending its deployment.","In addition, the new touch-enabled thin and light systems, along with Win 8 should be increasingly compelling in the client market. These dynamics should provide significant benefits for Seagate and the storage device industry. As such, we remain optimistic about the second half of calendar 2013 and beyond.","Keith, we\u2019re now ready to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) And your first question is from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.","Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi. Thanks very much. I was just wondering with the enterprise was clearly better than expected in the quarter versus when you went into the quarter, and I know we are going through inventory correction that really hit in the September quarter. Did you think that the upside particularly in near line was reflecting better end demand or was it really just a timing we\u2019re coming out of a inventory correction and we\u2019re just sort of correcting a little better and quicker than we thought, or do you think, I guess end demand was stronger than expected? Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","I think demand continues to increase in the near line space. I mean that\u2019s where the vast majority of the companies that are providing cloud infrastructure, purchase those types of devices, so as the cloud deployments continue, that market continues to grow. And I think in Seagate case, we did execute well in terms of in quarter upside there as well.","Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. And then if I get a follow-up i'm not sure if I do, but I will ask one, may be I\u2019m curious with LTAs as a run through here into that beginning of calendar 2013, any expectation that they impact your pricing or market share, or do you think they really don\u2019t have as much impact as maybe people think, or do you think they do? Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","I know I do what people think, but the LTAs again provided favorable pricing to the OEMs in the supply-constrained environment, substantially lower priced in the spot market would have provided at the time. And it was to align the longer-term purchase requirements of those customers with our supply situation. A number of those agreements have been extended. Others originally extended beyond this calendar year, last calendar year and this calendar year. So I don\u2019t see any big changes as a result of the constant evolution of the LTA agreements.","Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The question is on the TAM, if I compare the peak industry TAM about four or five quarters back, and with this quarter or the guided quarter for the March, it seem the industry and Seagate is operating less than 80% utilization. So I would like any comments thoughts about right sizing the capacity?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think our businesses isn\u2019t as simple as just taken the TAM and the number of units. So you have to take into consideration the nature of the devices so to split between client and enterprise and then the capacity per drive. So with average capacity per drive increasing the way it is, that\u2019s absorbing head and disks, which is a very good thing for a vertically integrated drive company. And with average capacity per drive continue to increase, that also absorbs test capital.","So our most expensive capital deployments are in heads and disks and test, and our most expensive R&D is in heads and disks. So as we continue to drive more heads and disks per platform, it\u2019s actually not a terrible situation in terms of being a flat TAM or slightly eroding TAM. That being said, clearly TAM growth would be a good thing in terms of a final assembly, but with the average capacity per drive right now, our factories are running at levels obviously it allow us to maintain these margins, and we are not considering any sort of reduction in sale just because our longer-term outlook obviously is different than what the situation looks like today is.","As you know, we believe that by the end of the decade there is going to be a significant demand for petabyte shift and that will evidence itself in unit growth, as well as average capacity per drive, so we don\u2019t want to take capital a lot right now.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, thanks. Just the last question on the Virident acquisition, a very interesting acquisition there, could you maybe talk about the Virident\u2019s current customers and kind of any of the traction where you would see in the market?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yeah, it was an investment.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Yes, sorry, yeah, I misspoke.","Stephen J. Luczo","And I\u2019ll let Rocky talk to the details of it. I\u2019ll just provide a brief little overview that is consistent with how we approach the emerging solid state market, which is developing nicely. And we believe that we have to participate in a variety of segments that we feel very good about our position. On the enterprise SaaS side with our partnership with Samsung, the PCIe space is clearly an attractive one. And we feel this partnership is going to allow us to address the needs of our OEM and distribution customers, and then we are doing things on the clients\u2019 space that we have talked in prior calls.","Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel","Yeah, I mean I think Steve just covered it. It\u2019s really another step in completing the platform for solid state storage that Seagate wants to offer alongside of its traditional magnetic core storage side. I think we\u2019re pretty excited about this engagement with Virident, not only to we have a strong go-to-market initiative, but also strong development initiative forward. And so as a result, we\u2019ll have a stack of SSD solid state solutions that span from the client all the way through to the flash server, high application, data demands of the massively scale data center.","Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please go ahead.","Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities","Very much. So it looks like your guiding down \u2013 revenue down 9% sequentially and that\u2019s worse than what I have in Western Digital down 3% sequentially. Maybe you can talk about why you think you\u2019re going to go down more, are you being more price aggressive than them? And also relates to this on the gross margin, do you expect to get a mix benefit in the March quarter, you had one in December just now, and with the lower revenue and perhaps no mix benefit, is there a possibility that it goes below your target of 27%?","Stephen J. Luczo","I\u2019m sorry, what was the last part of that?","Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities","The possibility of the gross margin goes below the 27%, what was your target range?","Stephen J. Luczo","I think we already indicated what we thought our gross margin is going to be, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that. On the first one, I\u2019m not sure what Western Digital\u2019s revenue decline was. I thought at the midpoint it was closer to 6% not 2%. But and for us I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in the first part of the call where we indicated that we\u2019re also at the near of the high end of our market share in the December quarter as a result of some really good in quarter execution to customer upsides.","At the low end of our range, we haven\u2019t modeled that type of performance again, we typically don\u2019t model that. So I think that the outlook for the markets, we maybe a touch more conservative in TAM than our competitors and coming off of the higher market share. We may have some small market share loss if we don\u2019t get the in quarter upside like we did. But in general, I think it\u2019s a fairly consistent, okay.","Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities","Just a quick one on Virident, right, can you talk about the opportunities with Web 2.0 customers?","Albert \"Rocky\" Pimentel","Well, we definitely think are the huge opportunity with Web 2.0 customers. When you actually look at the index that we manage to of our direct cloud-based customers, that share the business or that portion of our business grew strong double digits quarter-over-quarter, and certainly the Virident product solution is a very pertinent solution for the hyper-scaled cloud providers.","Shebly Seyrafi \u2013 FBN Securities","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question from me, Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your average capacity per drive, the recent trends are up again from like about 832, I think you said in a release from 802. You exited like fiscal 2011 like less than 600. I\u2019m just curious, can you talk about what\u2019s different between the first for this fiscal year versus maybe in the first half of last fiscal year, and then how you see that progressing and what are the key drivers over the next few quarters? Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","I think if we go back further than that, Steven, I think of it kind over a four-year trend and the average capacity per drive is kind of gone from mid 20s to mid 30s to mid 40s to mid 50s. And whether or not it goes to mid 60s, I guess we can argue about. But even at these rates given where areal density is, it\u2019s a good thing for the drive industry, because what we do is we ship petabytes, how we package them is probably the easiest thing that we\u2019re faced with, driving areal density and then of course managing our capital deployment and matching up with our customer needs architecturally is where a lot of our work goes. So I don\u2019t see it slowing down.","I just think if the \u2013 know if the silicon folks can keep on track in terms of reducing the cost of silicon and the software people can continue to develop nice portable easy open code, then we\u2019re going to see device proliferation in the client side, especially in the mobile space continue to grow and hopefully we go from 1.7 billion people connected to 2.7 billion connected and sharing all sorts of rich content which is what we hear about.","We do believe that to give people the user experience that they probably deserve at the edge, there is an opportunity for HDDs to play a greater role in some of the mobile devices and we\u2019re pursuing those discussions but clearly the backend infrastructure to support that type of data growth is a big opportunity for us. I don\u2019t see it slowing down if anything I see it accelerating.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","And do you see\u2026","Stephen J. Luczo","If you go to high frame rate video, you go to 4K video, I mean these imply, movies today in HD are 20 to 30 gigabytes and 4K that\u2019s just average frame rates is 100 to 200 gigabytes. So it just gives you a feel for the challenges we have gone for to provide storage people are going to need.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","So all that applies and given some of your previous comments that you are thinking at both the enterprise and clients side can grow capacities at a similar rate going forward, or is it a one that\u2019s going to grow faster?","Stephen J. Luczo","Depends on the application, enterprise has to be split, I think, in the mission critical enterprise versus maybe call service provider or content. If you are in an archiving mode, then clearly we believe that there are architectures we can deploy that drive capacity per drive. But if you are in the pure mission critical, you have a performance constraint that always has to be bought about. So it just depends on the application.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolas. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question guys; one on gross margin and a follow-up on the Virident acquisition. First on the gross margin line, can you just clarify how much benefit you got back from the Brazil situation last quarter? And then also as you think about people looking at these models on a capacity shift versus a unit TAM assumption, can you provide us an update on where you stand with regard to the industry supplying enough media as you expect obviously there is possibly to accelerate in terms of capacity per drive?","Stephen J. Luczo","I\u2019ll take the first one, Aaron. On the first one\u2026","Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel","Aaron, this is \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel. Let\u2019s clarify, you said acquisition, we made an strategic investment in Virident.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas","Fair enough, sorry. And I\u2019ll ask on that little bit.","Stephen J. Luczo","So on the Brazil issue, however, last quarter we said \u2013 at least half of the impact in that was even less than that this quarter, so it was measurable but not any frame that we were about. We\u2019ve put a plan in place to correctly resolve some of our provision in inventory and I think that\u2019s working well. So we think we largely taken care of that issue.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas","Okay. And then on the media in terms of continued increase and capacity per drive?","Stephen J. Luczo","Dave Mosley is on the call. I\u2019ll let Dave talk to that.","Dave Mosley","So just real quick, I think with the TAM being down here, we are putting more disks into each drive, but I think the industry is probably okay for the next couple of years depending on how you view the overall growth of petabytes and the box count. But after say 2015, there could be significant challenges if we could continue on the rates that Steve just illustrated. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019d answer that.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas","Okay. And then on Virident maybe you could help me, if you compare and contrast maybe this illusion relative to the primary competitor of the market being Fusionio, either from an architectural perspective and also on a cost per gigabit perspective if you can?","Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel","Yes, so one of the, Aaron, this is Rocky Pimentel again. Obviously \u2013 they actually have benchmarks that you can refer to on their website, but based on the benchmark, the external third-party benchmarking they\u2019ve done with their product against other leaders in \u201cthe category out there\u201d, they demonstrate the ability to exceed many of the key specs like IOPS et cetera against the incumbent competition out there. And I think secondly, another thing that we can bring to our relationship is the ability to drive their cost structure down from a product standpoint, given our scale and our involvement and other areas of solid state storage.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas","Okay. No quantification on cost per gig right now though?","Albert \u201cRocky\u201d Pimentel","No.","Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Meredith Dunne with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks. Someone in the industry have talked about hybrids accounting for about 0.5 of the 2.5-inch notebook drives for 2015. Just curious what your expectations are for that and whether there are any shifting capacity or utilization effects to think about in the market transition that could impact gross margins? And I have a follow-up as well, please.","Stephen J. Luczo","Sorry, I got the first part of that question. What\u2019s the second part of the question related to the first part or was that a second question?","Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo","It was, it was related to the first part.","Stephen J. Luczo","Okay, so while the first part is I think that those types of estimates are possible. And then what was the second part of it?","Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo","It\u2019s just in terms of \u2013 if that starts to ramp up and the HDD side starts to \u201cramp down\u201d just in terms of any sort of shift in that market impacting your gross margins?","Stephen J. Luczo","No, no. Hardware isn\u2019t HDD, it just also got flash in better than along with a bunch of software that makes that flash work well. So we don\u2019t, from a manufacturing perspective, we don\u2019t see that shift is being problematic because again its still lots of heads in this. And I think the trend up where we are at on single disk and two disk solutions is probably not necessarily influenced by hybrid. It\u2019s really a performance play. I think it\u2019s a big deal. I think because you kind of get the SSD \u2013 for example down at CES last month or whenever it was now, earlier this month hard to believe and just shocking the number of thin and light machines that are packed with expensive SSDs when you can use a hybrid drive for a lot less money with the same performance.","I think as the industry has now become the line around the right chipset and the right performance measures, we are going to see a lot of thin and lights that roll out with hybrid, because you can pickup ten times the capacity of one-fifth the cost and that probably will help the notebook market, that\u2019s probably more price sensitive than other market. So I think it\u2019s a big transition ahead of us.","Meredith Dunne \u2013 Wells Fargo","And along those lines, can you just talk about the opportunities in the tablet market and I am referring primarily to the ARM based market that\u2019s using flash today. May be if you could just talk about if and where discussions currently are? Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yeah. And I think it\u2019s a big opportunity again. We indicated that we believe to deliver the user experience that you probably deserve as a mobile user. There is lots of reasons that you need more storage capacity in that device, not citing anyone\u2019s product. We are just calling something a tablet. If you only have 16 or 32 gigs and you have to decide which three or four movies you are going to take with you seems kind of silly when you can take every movie your own for less cost and actually the same battery performance in the same (inaudible). So yeah, we think there is a big opportunity coming down the pipe for tablets as well and we are engaged on multiple fronts.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co., LLC","Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks to taking the question. Steve, let me just ask one on pricing here. I believe that earlier comments you guys are looking for March quarter pricing to be more flattish blended, and I think if I just work in a point of the guidance it seems like down mid-single digits. Is that accurate and if so can you just sort of walk through the puts and takes maybe it\u2019s a mix, talk about some of the mix issues, not issues but the mix situation in the December quarter that maybe them winding, just love to get your thoughts and I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","I think where we had some share gain in the December quarter was spread across all the markets, but probably a little heavier on the enterprise and on the newer line so that\u2019s partially influencing the AUP discussion. So in general, the pricing that we\u2019ve entered into was pretty much what we expected and pretty benign.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co., LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then I guess just to that end, the gross margins are still pretty solid in the March quarter. I guess even with \u2013 I\u2019m just I\u2019m sort of referring that maybe some of the market share gains in the enterprise, there\u2019s some of the share get backs that you\u2019re talking about the normalization and you still guiding to 27% gross margins in the March quarter. So not to get too far ahead, but can we infer that go and post the March quarter with sort of more of a normalized mix and you expect margins to still be pretty stable?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co., LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. Please go head.","Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research","Yeah, thanks. I calculate that your ASP for the December quarter was down Q-over-Q. So could you take and also you didn\u2019t reflect all your segment numbers. So if you are not divulging your segment numbers, could you at least take us through which segments drove that and if you don\u2019t mind, do you have older segment numbers?","Stephen J. Luczo","No, we don\u2019t have segments, but Pat you can talk to what the AUP decline was, pretty minimal as I recall of the September quarter.","Patrick O\u2019Malley","Yeah, AUP was managed mainly with mix. We had talked in the September out, it\u2019s September call in October that the pricing was negotiated in the backdrop if they had access and so we were heavier on pricing than historically in the December quarter, but even with that they were able to stay in the target margin range and we highlight that we will be going with fairly benign pricing going forward and that\u2019s been the case across the board.","Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research","Okay, thanks. And I\u2019d also like to ask question about the Virident investment note that I got that right. But so as you guys hope to get this product out to market, do you expect this to be margin neutral, margin accretive or margin dilutive, because it sounds like this is more of a distribution relationship and that the technology relationship is to come?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yeah, the first phase is definitely a go-to-market phase. The next phase will be joint development on product. And our intention is to make it margin neutral to margin accretive overall.","Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research","What about initially?","Stephen J. Luczo","Initially it will be pretty minor amounts of money. By the time it becomes visible, it should be margin neutral and margin accretive.","Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research","Okay. Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","And just on your first question, we just \u2013 we just look the AUP, the AUP decline was only 3% quarter-to-quarter, so that was a lot less in the price erosion that we have talked about.","Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray Carret & Co.","All right, okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Cindy Shaw with Discern. Please go ahead.","Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.","Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about LaCie, which you had for the first time in the fourth quarter, any impact for that on revenue and earnings as well as the SSD business sort of the non-traditional business. Is there any impact on revenue and earnings? And then I have a follow-up.","Bob Whitmore","LaCie is accretive to us. It\u2019s been a good investment. We are in the process of still integrating that. But that\u2019s been accretive and so as we would expect obviously that is some OpEx, but for what brings for breadth and depth on our portfolio is in expectations. And then your second part of the question?","Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.","Yeah. I was also asking about SSDs and other sort of non-traditional contributions? Then I have a follow-up after that.","Stephen J. Luczo","No big changes from the prior quarter.","Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.","Okay. And then the follow-up, the Cloud Builder Alliance, when will you be expecting to see revenue and really meaningful revenue out of that?","Stephen J. Luczo","Of what?","Bob Whitmore","Cloud Builder Alliance. We are in helping to engage the Cloud Builder Alliance. We are not going to get revenue from that. We are just engaging with them to help align the architectures and our products to contribute to that, so the second tier and direct builder architectures approach the market. But we are not going to get any direct revenue other than enabling the folks in that. We help enable the folks in that alliance to better tackle the market.","Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.","And when do you think, can you measure really when or how that\u2019s going to impact revenue or is it just too disconnected?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","No, I mean I think over the course of the back half of this year, we are definitely going to be able to measure it as cloud overall is one of our key initiative. So we\u2019ll be able to articulate the details of what that program is delivering. Like Pat said, it\u2019s really a market creation engagement vehicle, it\u2019s not a direct sales vehicle at this point.","Cindy Shaw \u2013 Discern, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jung Pak with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jung Pak \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thanks very much. The notebook market has been down for two consecutive quarters, what do you think inventory is with the OEMs in the channel for the notebook market? And what are your views for the notebook HDD shipments for the next quarter or two? Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","I think the inventories are better certainly over the last two quarters and probably closer to where the customers wanted me to have to ask the customers that. But I think from our perspective, no one is really confident on it, but our inventories are, so I don\u2019t know what that is. Our inventories are quite low, running almost a $0.5 billion of inventory less than our competitors.","So, we feel really good about our inventory balances, as far as we can tell that customers inventory balances are pretty well managed right now. And I think, the demand on the notebook side is really just a function of the new platforms gain traction, which is partially dependent on the touch-enabled technology and Win 8 deployment.","So we\u2019re kind of in a wait and see mode, but we\u2019re optimistic that things improve from here, well enough that happens in the March quarter, the June quarter, September quarter, we\u2019ll see. But I think we\u2019re probably skipping along the bottom here and I also think as hybrid start showing up in these devices, it\u2019s going to be a value add to the notebook market, because like I said you can get a lot more capacity in the same performance with a lot lower costs, so.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Sterling with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Sterling \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Hey, thank you. Given the limitations on the buybacks throughout 2013, can you discuss your plans for the dividend?","Stephen J. Luczo","Nothing different than what we\u2019ve already said and disclosed on our file documents, something we continue to look at every quarter. We don\u2019t really have a limitation on the buybacks. It\u2019s just that if we buyback too much stock, we run into section 382 issue. So it\u2019s just something you consider as we think about whether or not we want to pursue buybacks, but it\u2019s not a direct limitation.","Eric Sterling \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, thank you. I think that in December, you anniversaried one year on the Samsung acquisition. And if I remember correctly, there were some limitations on you combining the business with Samsung for at least a year. I was hoping you could give us an update on where you are with combining the business and do you expect to see any cost savings as we move through the year?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, for us, we integrated pretty much most of the areas where there were cost savings on the R&D side and on the operating side. Our limitations were and\/or really geared around the go-to-market side, sales, customer engagement, pricing. And you are right that the initial \u2013 on December 19 or 20 or 21, we had the right to ask the regulatory authorities to relapse those. We haven\u2019t done that. We continue to have a positive and constructive dialogue with Matcom and other regulators in China, and we are going to continue those dialogues and when appropriate then we\u2019ll seek release from the requirements.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thank you.","Stephen J. Luczo","Thank you. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your final question will be from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Scott Craig \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks, good afternoon. Here is a couple of questions around OpEx, do you made it from a longer-term perspective. Is there a revenue target or timing or something we could think around when you would reach the OpEx target of sort of 8% to 10% of revenue?","And then secondly, with regards to an earlier question on capacity if the PC market is a challenge to what some people think, and I believe their consensus is sort of where declined this year. How does that impact, what your capacity thoughts are for the back part of calendar 2013? Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo","Yeah, I kind of answered the second question already. I mean we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we manage our capacity more on our capital deployment as opposed to brick and mortar. As we look out to 2015, 2016 we believe that that this constant disconnect between petabyte growth rate and areal density growth rate is going to put extreme shortages in front of the drive industry at current capital deployment rate, so we don\u2019t want to walk away from brick and mortar, it\u2019s really how we manage the inside of the walls in the meantime.","And that\u2019s what we are doing very conservatively, so I don\u2019t think it changes any of that. I don\u2019t know that I agree with all the nay sayers anyhow I kind of like the term \u2013 what was the \u2013 what\u2019s the normal term on PC, post-PC, but whatever it is. It\u2019s really what the PC evolving to, and I think these convertible platforms that become tablets and notebooks and have onboard storage are very compelling, and I expect there will be resurgence in the client side of the market here in the not too distant future, but we\u2019ll watch it. And in terms of the OpEx question, we just see big opportunities on the mobile side, I mean call the infrastructure side where there is a lot of device level technology, software technology, and even system level technology that really only a drive company can provide and we don\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to investment in some of those fundamental technologies as these markets develop.","So I think for the incremental dollars, it\u2019s a prudent thing to do now, and then we\u2019ll see where the revenue flows with it. But clearly, we think these are multibillion dollar opportunities when you take mobile and cloud and think about the evolution of computing.","Over the next five to 10 years and so we want to position Seagate to participate not just as a device company, which will be our core, but some of the other opportunities that go along with it. So we\u2019ll manage it prudently and hopefully start to show some revenue associated with it in the next year.","Scott Craig \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen J. Luczo","Okay. Thanks very much. And on behalf of management team, I want to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and our shareholders for your support and commitment, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.

My name is Amanda, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Shanye Hudson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Shanye.","Shanye Hudson","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to today's call. Joining me today are Dave Mosley; Seagate's Chief Executive Officer; and Gianluca Romano, our Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our March 2019 quarter on the Investor section of our website. We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings release for our March 2019 quarter, which is posted on our website and has been furnished on a Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. ","As a reminder, this call contains forward-looking statements, including our June quarter financial outlook and expectations about our financial performance, market demand, industry growth trends, planned product introductions, ability to ramp production, future growth opportunities and general market conditions. These statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. ","Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of our website. Today's call is expected to be approximately 30 minutes in length and we'll do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks if time permits. Starting next quarter, we plan to extend our call to 60 minute in the duration.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Dave.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Shanye. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings call, which we are joining from Dublin, Ireland. During today's call, I will cover the key highlights from the March quarter, share some perspectives on the market, and outline our progress on advancing our technology roadmap. Gianluca will then discuss details of our March quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.","Seagate executed well in the March quarter, navigating challenging business conditions to deliver financial results that met or exceeded our expectations across every financial metric. We recorded revenue of $2.31 billion and achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, nearly $0.10 above the high end of our guidance range. Free cash flow increased to $291 million, up 81% quarter-over-quarter and we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to capital returns. We achieved these results through our focused efforts to drive operational efficiencies, control expenses, and optimize cash flow generation, proactively managing the business in the face of multiple revenue headwinds.","In the edge compute market, revenue was impacted by the expected transition to SSDs, ongoing CPU shortages, and seasonal demand slowdown for Notebooks and desktop PCs. In the surveillance market, revenue remained suppressed by economic and geopolitical uncertainties. However, over the long term, we expect the market to grow as camera resolution improves to 8 megapixels and drive the average capacity per drive above current levels of 3 to 4 terabytes. In the enterprise market, both seasonal and macroeconomic challenges weighed on revenue for our Nearline drives. ","Revenue from a few hyperscale customers improved slightly quarter-over-quarter. However, that revenue did not fully offset the slower demand from OEM and other global cloud customers. As a reminder, demand for our Nearline drives began to slow in the December quarter, as cloud service providers work through the inventory buildup during calendar 2018. However, we anticipate this pause to be short-lived. The demand improvement I just mentioned among select hyperscale customers is an indication that we are approaching the end of this inventory digestion phase, and we expect broader demand recovery starting in the second half of the calendar year.","We also believe some of the slowdown we are experiencing in our Nearline product demand is attributed to cloud customers anticipating the transition to our next generation, high capacity drives. We are very pleased to announce that we began shipping our 16 terabyte drives in late March as planned. We are delivering the industry's highest capacity disk drives to enable improved performance at the lowest total cost of ownership for our customers. Qualifications are underway at many major cloud and enterprise customers. ","We expect to begin ramping to high volume later in calendar 2019 and expect 16 terabyte drives will be our highest revenue SKU by this time next year. For Seagate, fiscal 2019 is a year of focused execution and technology advancement and we continue to successfully deliver on our plans. We expect to introduce drives with over 20 terabytes of capacity in calendar year 2020, based on our innovative HAMR recording technology. These technology breakthroughs are significant enablers providing a path to 40 terabytes and higher capacities, that's more than double the capacities available today, while at the same time making the transition to this new technology seamless for our customers.","Perhaps best stated by one of our large hyperscale customers working to qualify HAMR, it just works. We also made strides on our multi-actuator technology. During the recent Open Compute Project Summit, we set a new speed record for video streaming data rates from a hard drive. With our MACH.2 dual-actuator, we demonstrated twice the bandwidth compared to a single actuator drive, the fastest ever sustained transfer rates from a hard drive. We believe HAMR high density drives combined with our multi-actuator technology will not only address the heavy workloads and high utilization rates required by large cloud data centers, but also new use cases that are emerging at the edge. ","The Global Datasphere is expected to double once every three years to reach a staggering 175 zettabytes by 2025. This rapid growth in data creation is giving rise to new applications including smart cities, smart factories, genomics, autonomous vehicles, and other IoT applications, all of which employ AI machine learning to derive value from big data. To inform real-time decision making, we believe more data processing and machine learning will need to occur closer to the source of data creation. Seagate has referred to this transition as the IT 4.0 era or the rise in edge computing. ","We are starting to see a buildup in private and edge cloud environments to enable fast and secure access to data 24\/7. With this transition to IT 4.0 and associated growth in data at the edge, Exabyte demand for Nearline drives may exceed our prior growth estimates of between 35% and 40% over the long term. Importantly, Seagate's innovative technology portfolio positions us well to capture and monetize these opportunities.","I'll turn the call over to Gianluca to go into more depth on our third quarter results and share our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Gianluca Romano ","Thank you, Dave. In the March quarter, we delivered strong earnings and free cash flow underscored by our solid operational execution and focus on profitability in the phase of a challenging business environment. Consistent with our expectations, March quarter revenue was $2.31 billion, down 15% sequentially with total shipment of 77 exabytes down 12% quarter-over-quarter. Our results reflect the impact of softer demand from cloud service providers in advance of our transition to 16 terabyte Nearline drives as well as the ongoing global macro concerns and typical seasonality as Dave discussed earlier. ","Revenue for the enterprise market, which includes Nearline and mission-critical hard disk drives represented 39% of March quarter revenue, flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter. We shipped approximately 33 exabytes into the enterprise market, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The vast majority of the exabyte shipments were into the Nearline market. Exabyte shipment for cloud customers were up quarter-over-quarter, which partially offset the decline in shipments to OEMs. The average capacity for Nearline drives hit a new record of 7.2 terabytes, up 11% over the prior quarter. Our 12 terrabyte Nearline drive remained the highest-selling enterprise product in the March quarter.","As Dave indicated earlier, we have started to ship the industry's highest capacity 16 terabyte drive in the current quarter and expect to ramp production as customers complete their qualification over the next few quarters. Given the total cost of ownership benefit for customers and expected high reliability of these drives, we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities in the coming quarters. We also continue to leverage our existing product portfolio to address customer demand for mission-critical drives, which positively contributes to our margin and cash flow.","Revenue for the non-compute market contributed 32% of the total March quarter revenue compared to 31% in the prior quarter. And includes sales of surveillance, gaming, NAS, DVR, and consumer applications. Sales for data breach application including gaming NAS and DVR grew sequentially, which partially offset the micro headwind and seasonal trend impacting the surveillance and consumer market respectively. Exabyte shipments for edge non-compute platform was 29 exabyte and down 10% quarter-over-quarter. While, average capacity per drive remain approximately flat at 2.4 terabyte. ","Revenue from the edge compute market including desktop and notebook, hard disk drives represented 20% of total revenue compared to 21% in the December quarter. Our results as a typical seasonality, combined with ongoing CPU shortages. Exabyte shipments for edge compute platforms were nearly 15 exabyte down 21% quarter-over-quarter with steeper than seasonal decline from notebook and desktop PCs. Our Non-hard disc drive business including SSD and cloud system solution made up the remaining 8% of March quarter revenue flat as a percent of revenue from the December quarter.","As we have shared over the past couple of quarters, we are focused on portfolio management to capture opportunity that delivered the highest value to our customers. We continue to make good progress also it would take time to fully make these transition, cloud systems revenue as it remains relatively stable over the past several quarters. SSD revenue declined sequentially ahead of planned product transition, which are expected to occur over the next couple of quarters. ","Non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was above our expectations at 26.6% compared to 29.7% in the December quarter. About half of the sequential margin decline was associated with manufacturing underutilization costs as we effectively manage our production to more closely aligned with industry conditions. Capacity utilization is that rightly correlated to portfolio mix, higher capacity drives such as Nearline and surveillance utilize more head and disc and take longer to test compared to lower capacity HDDs. ","Accordingly, we expect capacity underutilization costs to decline and gross margin to improve when demand resume on higher capacity drives. Non-GAAP operating expenses came in better than our expectation as $349 million, down 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, the decline in spending reflects ongoing expense discipline and lower variable compensation expense. We continue to focus on managing expenses and utilizing capital for R&D investment to advance our future technology products and solutions. Through operational efficiency and expense discipline we deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 in the March quarter well above the high end of our guidance range.","Our operational focus has also led to solid return on invested capital. On a rolling four quarter basis ROIC expanded to nearly 27% in the March quarter compared to 25% in the prior year period. We generated $438 million in cash from operations up 52% sequentially as we improved working capital, including a 9% decline in total inventory value quarter-over-quarter. Capital expenditure were $147 million during the March quarter at the lower end of our long-term target range of between 6% and 8% of revenue. Our resulting free cash flow was $291 million, up 81% from the prior quarter. We utilized $327 million to repurchase 7.2 million ordinary share and we exited the quarter with $277 million ordinary shares outstanding. Fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased 13.4 million ordinary shares and reduced our share count by 4%. ","Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter and our Board has approved the quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 per share, which will be payable on July 3, 2018. 2019. During the March quarter, we entered a new $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. The company's net balance as of March quarter was $4.5 billion, including $200 million drawn from the revolver. Our gross debt to last 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio is 1.9 times as of the March quarter.","Moving to our outlook for the June quarter, we anticipate a relatively flat business environment in the June quarter, we similar demand conditions across all of our end markets. In this environment, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion plus or minus 5%, non-GAAP gross margin to be at least 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 plus or minus 5%. During this period, Seagate will continue to drive operational efficiencies to optimize our profitability and free cash flow. While business conditions remain somewhat challenging in the June quarter, based on our interaction with customers, we expect demand to recover starting the second half of the calendar year.","I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Gianluca. In summary, Seagate is executing well on multiple levels. We are driving operational efficiencies by managing our cost and capital investments to align with near-term industry conditions, and optimize profitability and free cash flow. We are harvesting HDD opportunities and markets with low exabyte growth such as mission critical drivers which contributed nicely to our bottom line particularly during these slower demand periods while requiring no R&D investment. ","We are executing our technology roadmap and leveraging our 40 plus year heritage of innovation and expertise and precision engineered data solution to introduce new products with the higher areal density, quality and reliability to address our customers' future mass storage requirements. We believe the near-term industry headwinds we are experiencing will abate in the coming quarters and the long-term growth trajectory of mass storage demand provides a rich set of opportunities for Seagate. Data hungry applications are fueling demand for high-capacity storage in both public and private clouds. ","Looking ahead to fiscal 2020 we expect the exabyte TAM for Nearline drives to be well above the long-term CAGR of 35% to 40% importantly, Seagate's strong technology portfolio and customer relationships, make us well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Before opening the call for questions, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their ongoing support and contributions to the success of our business.","Gianluca and I will now open up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good morning. How do you think about the gross margin trajectory as demand comes back? If we see stronger cloud and surveillance demand in the September quarter, would you expect gross margins to be in the 29% to 33% long-term range or does it take a couple of quarters to expand back to the target model?","Dave Mosley","Hi Katy, I'll pass it over to Gianluca in just a second, but what I would say is -- what I talked about last quarter was, if gross margins as we went through these digestion phases, if we got out of the period of factory under-utilization faster, then we might see expansion. I think what we're seeing right now is rather a bit of a build ahead for the fall. I mean, we've got these product transitions going on, which I think is weighing us down just a little bit. Otherwise, we would have snapped back a little bit faster. I'm sure if the cloud comes back faster than we're anticipating right now, which we are starting to see signs of it in the back half, then I think we should be able to get back into the range. ","And I think I've said this before that our [indiscernible] is not gross margin percentage either. We were in the January timeframe when we last spoke to everyone. We were really focused on free cash flow, just making sure we watched our cash very carefully, make sure we weren't holding too much inventory and things like that, so, you know, that may have actually hindered our ability to move a little bit extra product in this last few months. Again, I'd say that's towards the conservative side on my part, but that's how I think about the gross margin. Go ahead, Gianluca.","Gianluca Romano","Yes. Last earnings release, we said that we were expecting about half of the gross margin decline quarter-over-quarter to be related to lower volume produced, and we still expect more or less the same impact in FQ4. Our volume in FQ4 will be a little bit higher. But, at the same time, we are building more capacity in our factory in order to take advantage of the second part of the calendar year where we expect more demand to come in. So, the impact of under-utilization charges will be more or less the same in Q3 and Q4.","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mitch Steves","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had a question more on the PC side of the business. It sounds like you guys are seeing some weakness due to CPU constraints, is there any way to help us quantify what that impact is? And then secondly, when you think that will be an upbeat since it probably impacts the results on the hard disk drive side?","Dave Mosley","Yes, Mitch. I would say it's against the backdrop, like we talked about in the script of all the SSD incursions, natural transitions, especially for the lower capacity stuff. So in what we call the enterprise, sorry the edge compute markets, you're seeing some low capacities 500 gigabytes or 1 terabyte, and then you're seeing some high capacity, some bifurcation if you will to 2s and 4 terabytes. Where the CPU constraints are a problem usually are of smaller players, so the long tail, if you will, distribution channel I think would be a good way to think about it. In the distribution channel, there are some people still making the lower capacity disk drive products, but very few, I think they tend to be much more entrepreneurial. I talked about this a little bit last quarter. We still haven't seen the healthy channels just yet. ","So while, weeks on hand are fairly healthy on a relative basis, I look at the absolute value of the channel, and it's not as strong nearly as it was just a couple of quarters ago. And that includes the higher capacity stuff, which should be some of those new markets and creative new markets. So, you know, my perspective is this will start to come online as well through in the back half of the year, but it really hasn't built up as much momentum as I expected in the January time frame.","Mitch Steves","Got it. And just to clarify, is that impacting the margin line, the gross margin line as well, given that prior under shipping demand [ph] a bit?","Dave Mosley","To the extent that we have more product to be absorbing our factories, the answer is yes. And, you know, the distribution channels, some of them tended to over time provide some nice outlets at low capacities and high capacities, so it would be nice to get some of the high capacity stuff moving again.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess good afternoon for you guys. Dave and Gianluca, thanks for taking the question. I guess, just real quick a couple from me. So Dave, is it safe to say that since we're sort of 90 days further through the calendar that you feel that we\u2019re sort of confident about the hyperscale picking back up as we get into the second half of the year? I guess from just a quick second part to that, with regards to your comment about fiscal 2020 demand, how long do you see, I guess this is all kind of -- just got at this point, but how long do you see, how long are you hopeful that this next cycle can last once you get started? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","It's interesting. So a couple of points. So, I think on the February call, we were just coming off of a fairly disturbed pull dynamics that were going on all the way through December. And the cloud was one aspect of it, not the only one obviously. It was fairly global. It's also got a long tail. It's not just one CSP or 3 CSPs or something, but it's also the smaller build out. The reason we have confidence in the back half of the year now is we're starting to see some of the data center build out that was anticipated, say 6 months or 9 months ago to be discussed again, the exact same datacenters again, especially globally. ","And then we also think that there has been some inventory readjustments that have gone on for the last 6 months. There will be an anticipation of moving to higher high-capacity drives with better total cost of ownership propositions out on the back half of the year. So, we're feeling a lot more confident that we were there talking to you in February, for sure. As far as the next cycle, this one's been a little bit more pronounced than the last one that it feels that way, and it's been more global and it's been touching as we reach out through OEMs and ODMs who are helping do the builds, it's been much more broad based than the last one.","The last one came back pretty quickly, because of the world turning on at the same time, we're hearing roomers of all this, but I still wouldn't say strong, but it feels like this would maybe a bigger peak in exabytes but much wider, I'd say that way, because, just because there would be a little bit of trepidation.","Ananda Baruah","That's helpful. I'll stop there and see the floor. Thanks so much.","Dave Mosley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Stifel. Your line is open.","Kevin Cassidy","Thanks for taking my question. On the 16-terabyte what are the unit volumes, how did that compare to last year and any other new product ramp?","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Kevin. Yes, we like this platform quite a bit, there is, we get through a lot of transitions to your point, different drives going from 6 to 8 to ten to twelve to fourteen, we've had different drive platforms. This particular platform for us will take us 16 and 18 with SMR and other variance it will take us beyond 18-terabytes and probably into the HAMR families as well, because HAMR is basically dropping into this when we are ready. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to yield and ramp this product. It's gone through all its internal qualification testing really well and so that's why we are fairly aggressive about it. I think it's going to be a pretty steep ramp as well. ","So, in the last couple of months, just giving lead times for largely the head wafers that are required for that, that's where we have focused a lot of our efforts internally. My senses as well that given some of the pause that's gone on in hyperscale and other places around the world that the value proposition of 16-terabytes versus maybe 12, it was thought of 6 months ago when the fall started, it's pretty substantial. And I think we'll start to see those revenue ramps in early, fiscal year 2020.","Kevin Cassidy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Kind of building on the high capacity Nearline drives, one of your competitors kind of notes as far as in the context of visibility kind of stocking relationship and visibility and from an inventory, even getting paid the wholesome inventory for some of the hyperscale customers. So I'm curious that how do you characterize your visibility? Do you have similar relationship as that ? And then also how would you compare 16 terabytes competitively versus the competitors that you see and when they might come into market? Thank you.","Dave Mosley","Aaron, the second question first. I don't really, we believe, we are in the lead on 16 terabytes and the families that go on along with it with different SMR variance and things like that. It's like, it seems, I don't have very good visibility beyond there as far as when people are going to be able to ramp. All I know is, we're ready to ramp. Relative the stocking, I do think there are a few customers that have such huge scale that they start talking like that, other customers are much more opportunistic and it's been a buyer's market recently. ","So we were, like I said, earlier, we were 90 days ago, we were really watching our cash and controlling our bills very, very carefully to make sure we didn't carry too much inventory. If we had pushed out more of the lower capacity drives in anticipation of higher capacity, I don't if that serves us right either, so that's the way we are thinking about it, if that helps","Aaron Rakers","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes online of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you. In your prepared comments you mentioned an improving demand environment in the second half whereas the year progresses, is that based upon older trends that you're seeing or more anecdotal of customers sweating or using their assets a little bit longer just trying to help figure out the conviction level of that rebound in demand?","Dave Mosley","Jim, it's, interesting because I think there's a little bit of both of what you said. The first is people know that they're going to be making the investment for 5 or 6 or 7 years when they buy the next product, so, they'll wait to get the right TCO proposition, that's, these are more hyperscale and global hyperscale comments. I think relative to my earlier comments about some of the channels have been disrupted, there were lots of liquidity issues especially among smaller players, more entrepreneurial people were trying to do edge build out, very application specific items and because of that I think the market has been pretty choppy, we're starting to see our way through that, people are coming back to those plans again, as we all know data will grow and some of these new applications will take off. So, but I think given some of the issues the world was having back in the December time frame we just didn't have very good visibility in them, so we're still expressing confidence against this next cycle.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Management.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Amanda. I want to once again thank all of our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our third quarter performance. And thanks to our shareholders for their ongoing support. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Pat O'Malley, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology; Rocky Pimentel, President, Global Markets and Customers; and Phil Brace, President, Cloud Systems and Electronic Solutions.","We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fourth fiscal quarter and year-end 2015 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the quarter, provide the company outlook for the first fiscal quarter and full year 2016, and then open the call up for questions.","We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our supplemental information on our website.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fourth fiscal quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 27.2%, net income of $250 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. Overall storage shipments for the June quarter were 52 exabytes, up 5% year over year, with an average capacity per drive continuing to average over 1.1 terabytes per drive.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and new adjacencies, in addition to lower variable compensation. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $228 million, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. Our inventory levels were reduced 8% sequentially, and we exited Q4 with the lowest level of HDD finished goods inventory value since 2009. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended this quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.","Revenue challenges from macroeconomic pressures and PC systems demand have been persistent factors that have offset continued growth in other areas of our business. While the magnitude of these factors did not increase intra-quarter in June, conditions did not improve as we expected, resulting in an impact to our revenue greater than our initial expectations. In light of the mixed market dynamic conditions over the last few quarters, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution in fiscal year 2015. Highlights include total revenues of $13.7 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.1%, net income of $1.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $4.57.","Over the course of the fiscal year, we shipped over 228 exabytes of storage, up 13% from fiscal year 2014. Within this, Seagate's nearline cloud exabyte shipments increased more than 50%, indicating that we are gaining traction with the higher-capacity offerings in our nearline portfolio and our longer-term thesis of data growth and shifts to cloud infrastructure and hyperscale deployments continue to progress.","In fiscal year 2015, Seagate generated over $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, including the legal settlement from Western Digital. We returned greater than 65% of our operating cash flow, or $1.8 billion, to shareholders in the form of dividend and share redemptions in fiscal year 2015, increasing our dividend per share by 26% and decreasing our shares outstanding by 6%. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our businesses.","From an R&D perspective, we have successfully transformed a good portion of our traditional storage hardware portfolio and made extensive progress towards pursuing our adjacencies in cloud systems and flash technology. We will have more discussion regarding our technology portfolio advancements and related opportunities at our strategic update on September 2.","For the September quarter, we are forecasting for a relatively flat business environment, as we continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitability and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. For the September quarter, we are planning for revenue of approximately $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion, and we anticipate margins to be relatively flat, taking into account the anticipated seasonal mix and a lean production schedule.","As of today, we have redeemed approximately 14.5 million shares of stock quarter to date, and we are on pace to exit the quarter with less than 300 million shares outstanding, returning over $900 million to investors through dividend and share redemptions in the September quarter.","Operationally, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of our expense base and have identified areas where we can improve efficiency and lower cost in fiscal year 2016. For the September quarter, we are targeting operating expense to be flat sequentially at approximately $515 million. We plan to actively address additional savings opportunities through the end of the calendar year, and we expect operating expenses will be comfortably under $500 million a quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2016. These actions will decrease total operating expense by at least 10% for the fiscal year.","As a result of our business outlook, capital allocation, and expense control, we are targeting at least 10% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year 2016. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers, and shareholders for their ongoing support.","I'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. First of all, I was just curious, what was the ending share count coming out of the June quarter? And then the question would be, is \u2013 can you talk a little bit about the gross margin drivers this quarter? I think your initial guidance was 28.5%. Can you bridge the gap between how much absorption effect of fixed cost or utilization was an impact versus, say, mix or pricing?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me take the second one while Pat gets the answer to the first one. I think in terms of the gross margin, Aaron, the delta kind of makes sense to us all in all. Probably the biggest change was the absorption issue. So we ran our factories really lean. Our inventory levels are 35% below the competition's right now. And that absorption impact maybe was as much as 100 basis points. So that's significant.","I think other issues are \u2013 we've only had 24 hours to look at the other results, but it does seem like the competition attained revenue earlier in the quarter by virtue of the DSO, and that usually has a margin impact just because pricing sometimes gets more challenging through the quarter. And it looks also that they probably had some share gain in nearline distribution, which is probably a nice margin advantage as well. And so we're off to kind of decide \u2013 figure out where that opportunity lays for us in the next couple of quarters.","I think the fourth point is probably that for the non-HDD businesses for both of us, which are $250 million-ish, while I think both of us obviously are running margins below the corporate average, our estimate is that ours are further below, and so we still have work to do there, as we've talked before, over the next couple of quarters to prove that margin profile. So I think the combination of things explains the delta to our original forecast and probably the delta to the competition as well. But the single biggest point was we basically ran our factories really lean and reduced inventory, and that has a big absorption impact.","Patrick O'Malley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the share count, Aaron, we were at 315 million. We're down to slightly over 300 million right now as we sit.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick O'Malley - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And that's actual shares outstanding.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just on non-HDD business, I was wondering if you could provide some highlights on the $250 million, what was doing better. And then also if you made any kind of margin improvement in that non-HDD business during the quarter and how you might have attained that, or is that still on the come?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we'll have Phil answer on that.","Philip G. Brace - President-Cloud Systems & Electronics Solutions","Yeah, I think that overall the quarter proceeded as expected. We saw a little bit of softness in the overall system business, primarily related to OEM storage-related sales there. I think you see that reflected in other people's reports. Our flash business, particularly in the PCIe business, continues to be strong and a growth driver for us in that space. So when we look out in time, I think we continue to be excited about our growth prospects there, and we'll continue to work to improve the operational performance of the business going forward.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","And then in terms of profitability in that area? Any other color?","Philip G. Brace - President-Cloud Systems & Electronics Solutions","Well, I think as Steve said, right now it's trailing below the corporate average overall in an aggregate perspective, and I think that we've got a number of levers that we're working to over the coming periods to kind of continue to improve the operational performance of the business.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. And then just lastly, I know it's not the greatest question to ask after \u2013 with PC demand where it is, but in terms of your upside flexibility, given that average capacities are still rising and you're looking to improve profitability, how would you describe your ability to react to some upside surprises over the next couple quarters?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the client-side?","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Overall, just thinking about -","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on the client side, it's pretty easy. The lead times are in quarter usually, and the test times are pretty short. So one of the reasons we ran inventories really lean is because at least if the pocket of upside is client, we can chase that very efficiently. Seagate's great at doing that. And as you know, we're also on the front end of a big product rotation in those categories, so it's smart for us keep our inventories really lean as we go into the new cycle, which we're very excited about. I think on the nearline, it's much tougher. Lead times on nearline, between wafer and test, are well beyond 13 weeks. So, unless you're staging inventory, which we can stage some inventory, say, if we're at wafer level or whatever to take some of that lead time out, chasing big upsides on nearline and mission-critical is much more difficult. So it just depends where the products come in.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","I just wanted to get a sense for, you talked about potentially looking at operating expense changes for fiscal 2016 having an effect on second half. What about on the manufacturing side? Do you feel like there's some room there where you could take some capacity out, or is it really not expensive capacity and it's just better to leave it in place?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well yeah, we didn't say maybe we were going to look at some opportunities. We are going to take actions, so we will be under $500 million exiting the calendar year, Rich, just to be clear on that \u2013 I mean per quarter on OpEx. And I do think there's opportunities on the cost of goods side, which we're also looking at. We'll probably have an update for you on that in September.","In terms of taking out capacity, which may or may not be an action that the competition's taking, it wasn't quite clear to us what was going on in that restructuring charge. And we didn't really understand the answer, that we don't think that taking out a major asset right now is the right move, just because as you know we still are very bullish on the long-term prospects of exabyte growth, and we're actually bullish on client ultimately, as I've talked before. It just depends how you define client. And we believe there'll be a whole new class of clients that are going to need lots of storage. So we don't want to take a bunch of capacity off and then turn around and be putting capacity on. So if things stay low for a while, sure, you have options to do that, but that's not where we're at right now. But there are probably efficiencies that'll flow through to the cost of good lines as well.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","And as you look at the capacity enterprise space, you've chosen to move to SMR, right, and then provide other air-based solutions. Where you see the need for helium, if at all, over the next couple generations?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's a funny question. First the question is, where do you see the need for helium, is probably 10 terabytes. The question is, what's the ownership cost all-in between 8 TB and 10 TB? It just seems to us that the 8 TB platform is going to be a massive platform that lasts for a long time relative to 10 TB. So the answer is probably 10 TB, but we're just leaning into the 6's and 8's right now, and we think there's a huge run in front of us on that. And those are really low-cost platforms for us because we don't need to use helium.","Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC","Excellent. Okay. Thank you very much.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats, really nice job on the OpEx. Just one for me if I could. Steve, would love to get your longer-term view on exabyte growth, given the market dynamics that we've seen with XP refresh over the last 12 months. And then would also love to get what your view is on what the different applications are that layer into that kind of growth view over the next couple of years and how it manifests. Thanks.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, again, you have to break the market down into the client side and basically the enterprise side, which then breaks into legacy and nearline or cloud service providers.","I think on the client side, I think for the next 18 and 24 months it's a tough market. Because the existing definition of client probably isn't going to change much between desktop, notebook, tablet, and phones of two different sizes. And I think the mix-and-match of that client is probably kind of a net-zero-sum game in terms of the trade-offs that people are making in platforms. Now, the trend away from tablets to big phones is probably also going to benefit notebooks, because at some point, you need a bigger platform and a bigger screen to deal with.","And then all of those have implications of that they don't have a lot of storage on board. And what I mean by a lot is certainly more than 128, maybe even more than 256. Then you an external storage play, which \u2013 we continue to see the exabyte shipments on the branded business exceeding that that goes in the cloud, which people kind of still haven't really focused on. But I do think that in the commercial space for notebook, there'll be the continued advance of platforms with less onboard storage, and it'll probably be serviced by 128 gigs of flash more and more. It's still not half the market, but I think it's growing.","I think on the consumer side, the HDD play is still the obvious play, just because consumers are big users of content, and the performance and cost, obvious, of HDDs if you want 1 or 2 terabytes is kind of untouchable. So I think then the issue is what happens. And, again, I think it's the idea around the new client, whether or not it's 3D printers, or whether or not it's AR\/VR, whether or not it's robotics or surveillance capture devices. There's going to be a whole host of new clients that we're particularly excited about that I think will benefit the clients downstream. And also, when we hit new capacity points, which we'll likely hit this year, there could be a rejuvenation on the HDD side.","On the enterprise side, you have legacy, which continues to kind of march along at stronger rates than people have expected. I think that'll continue. And the real growth is in nearline, and I think that's where it's particularly exciting. Data science applications, machine-to-machine data creation, and of course just in massive amounts of unstructured data, mostly in the form of video, and especially hi-def, 4K video. It's just growing rapidly, and that's being deployed around the world. And all of the implications for that at the application level, obviously, are what's exciting. And then that's obviously creating the impetus for people to want to store this stuff.","So we're particularly excited about that. We don't get really hung up on is it a hybrid cloud model, or everything's going to five big CSPs. We engage, obviously, with all of them. We believe it's a hybrid cloud model, which is probably going to inform Phil's business to a greater degree, because there will be, we think, lots of petabytes shipped into corporations that want to basically have their own, quote, \"cloud,\" as well as leveraging off of any other public clouds. But we're well-positioned either way. So I think the excitement, clearly, on exabyte growth is in that category. And overall, I think, you still see data in the data centers that shows exabyte growth still annually clipping above 50% and some at 100%, depending on CSPs. And overall, we still think that the exabyte growth will be in excess of areal density, which means we're going to absorb more heads and disks and test time, which is also critical.","The other final point \u2013 and sorry for the super long-winded answer \u2013 but it's not just about exabyte growth. It's about the packaging the exabytes. And again, I think financial analysts have continued to miss the shift from client to cloud, the implications for that, not just in terms of heads and disk absorption in terms of units, but heads and disk absorption and test in terms of complexity or content, people are missing. So as you move to a 6 and an 8 and a 10 and beyond that terabyte drives, the processed content inside of the heads and the disk and the related test codes increases dramatically. So in addition to the more piece parts that are required for more heads and disks per platform, the content inside those piece points is getting more intense, which also results in more absorption.","So the trend is in our favor. Sure, it'd be great to have a bunch of client growth on top of it, but if the trend is just this, it's a good thing for the drive industry, and we're positioning ourselves obviously from a technology perspective to have best-in-class products.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. See you in September.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions from me. One, Steve, you talked about a non-GAAP EPS growth of 10% next year in fiscal 2016, I guess. Could you just talk about what are your assumptions there? Because it seems like you would get there on the OpEx control and raise share count (22:56) Curious how you think about TAM in context of that EPS growth number.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, what we said, at least, and so our assumptions right now, at a high level, but we want to kind of preserve this for September, because it's a fairly complex story in terms of what's going on underneath the high level. But right now the assumption is for, think of it as a relatively flat revenue TAM. And then to your point, operating expense controls as mentioned. And again don't forget, some of these operating savings don't occur till the second half of the year, so it's a little different than just saying it's all coming from OpEx, because the math actually doesn't say that. But it's generally, you're right generally in terms of direction, and that's why we're confident we can do this, because we can manage the OpEx and we don't think our revenue assumption is wildly optimistic.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. If I just follow up on your systems business, the non-HDD side, you have a couple assets like the controller business from LSI, the enclosures from Xyratex. Do you consider these as core assets to Seagate's systems portfolio as you go forward, or could these be things that you would look to divest to, at least reduce the headwind they cause on your margin profile?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, those are really great technologies, and they result in really sticky customer relationships. The controller technology in particular is very interesting, because it's flash-agnostic, and for a while I've been kind of marching down a theme that while the conventional wisdom is owning the media is a huge cost advantage and therefore you have to own the media, the reality is only one company can be leading in media, and everybody else by definition is behind. Now someone may just be a little bit behind, and someone may be a lot of bit behind. But if you're running fabs, you're going to keep those fabs open. And if your flash isn't competitive, you got a problem.","Whereas with our technology, we could take that controller technology and apply it to whoever has the best flash or the cheapest flash or a combination thereof. And I'm not completely convinced yet that the companies that are actually media independent might have a better advantage long term in certain market segments, certainly not if you're talking about low-grade consumer flash. But certainly stuff that requires workload that we're experts at, we actually like having the optionality. And our controller technology does inform us in terms of our overall system strategy. So the intent obviously is to keep it internal. If someone wanted to pay us $50 billion for it, we'd probably sell it.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I want go back to your commentary about a flat top line, and I want to better understand kind of assumptions in different scenarios. On the client side, it seems like the SSD adoption is accelerating, and on the nearline, where there is growth, there is also more competition. You have Samsung that is becoming very aggressive with their new flash technology. They're selling it below cost. And you have different alternative technologies that are also trying to minimize the hardware procurement. And in that context, I want to better understand some of your key assumptions with the cloud and nearline, and how do you see the risk or competition? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, come to September 2 conference, and we'll fill you in on all that. Just one quick answer. There's no one that's using SSDs for storage. I mean, maybe at the margin for replacing boot drives \u2013 I mean, maybe 1% or 3% of the hierarchy is SSDs for storage. Most of your flash product is actually not hanging off the storage bus; it's fast memory. So I think you have to be careful about where you're talking about where our devices go versus where flash is used. Most implementations of flash in a data center also have massive amounts of storage, and in fact depending on what application you're running, the flash enabled you to actually need to control more storage because of the type of analytics that you're doing. But that's the whole point of September, and we'll talk about all that then.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's fair. And then in terms of just accelerating the capacity, do you really need the helium? What is the incremental cost for increasing the capacity per drive, especially for the nearline? Is there any opportunity that you can add more capacity and \u2013 being able to drive the growth?","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's expensive, and I'll let Dave talk to that. Do you need it? We don't think you need it in the near term. We think 6s and 8s on air are a really compelling product from an overall perspective, whether or not it's acquisition cost or ongoing costs. I'll let Dave talk about that. But if you need to get to 10 terabytes, given our view of technology today at 10 TB and at the discount that we're looking at, you probably need helium. But it's a big cost adder, and then you just have say which markets are willing to pay that? And, Dave, you want to provide any other color?","William D. Mosley - President-Operations & Technology","All I'd add is that customers have to make a total cost of ownership decision relative to the power savings that you get from helium, which is nice, versus the cost adders that you're talking about.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Could you, Steve, just discuss the demand trends you're seeing in all your segments, especially in the hyperscale customers? You talked about last quarter that you expect demand to be 60% second half. Is it still the expectation? Thank you.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm sorry, this will have to be last question, because the market's about open. Yeah, I'd say we're still feeling it's kind of a 60\/40 back half to the first half of the year for the nearline cloud service providers. And then overall, as I said, feels pretty flat to us right now. Obviously, generally the second half is stronger. We do have some favorable things in the marketplace between the new Intel chip and Win10, maybe that drives some acceleration. But I was wrong last quarter anticipating that. I don't want to be wrong, at least in the same direction, twice in a row. So we're remaining conservative and just calling for a flat quarter in the other segments. But I do think we will see strength in the nearline. And legacy, as you know, is kind of fits and starts. So we'll see where we're at on legacy. But in general, legacy has been better than people would've anticipated.","Stephen J. Luczo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Good. I want to thank everyone for taking the time today. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter, but of course we'll see many of you in September.

Please proceed, Kate.","Kate Scolnick","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s call. Joining me today from Seagate\u2019s executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO, Pat O'Malley, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President, Operations and Technology; Rocky Pimentel, President, Global Markets and Customers; and our General Counsel, Ken Massaroni.","We posted our press release and detailed supplemental information about our fiscal third quarter on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. During today\u2019s call, we will review the highlights from the March quarter, provide the company outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter 2015 and then open the call for questions.","We will refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, which are reconciled to GAAP figures in our supplemental information on our website. We\u2019re planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour and we will do our best to accommodate your questions in that time frame.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fiscal third quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $3.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.9%, net income of $357 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.08.","As we indicated in our business outlook in January, challenges from macroeconomic pressures in Europe and PC demand were factors we needed to manage through the quarter. The magnitude of these factors actually increased in third quarter, resulting in an impact to our top line revenue beyond our initial expectations, particularly in our EMEA business which was down approximately $100 million sequentially.","In light of these dynamic market conditions, we are satisfied with the company\u2019s overall execution this quarter and we\u2019re particularly pleased with our sequential gross margin improvements and demonstration of operation expense control.","Overall storage shipments for the March quarter were 55 exabytes, up 9% year over year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive.","Cash flow generation was again strong in the March quarter and we achieved $374 million in operating cash flow and $215 million in free cash flow, including our previously announced $225 million payment for our tax audit assessment with the State Tax Bureau in China.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and some optimization in our Cloud Systems and Solutions business.","Capital expenditures in the March quarter were in line with our expectations and inventory both internally and externally are within manageable levels. Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents.","During the quarter, we returned $882 million to shareholders in dividends and stock redemptions. We redeemed approximately 12 million shares, ending the quarter with 318 million ordinary shares outstanding. Year to date, we have returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and have redeemed approximately 5% of our ordinary shares outstanding.","We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with the long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our business.","Before I cover our business outlook, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave Mosley to provide an update on the technology portfolio refresh that is underway across our business.","Dave Mosley","Thanks, Steve. Regarding our comments last quarter that we\u2019re in the process of refreshing significant portions of our HDD and SSD product portfolio, I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re executing very well on our plans.","Development in progress and customer qualification activity is on schedule, with our traditional enterprise mission critical HDDs as well as with our newest high-capacity cloud offerings, our 4 terabyte, 6 terabyte, and 8 terabyte platforms are performing extremely well in the field and customer adoption was strong is Q3.","In the retail space, our 2 terabyte 2.5-inch drive still leads the industry in areal density and will be refreshed in the next two quarters to a higher capacity, maintaining our leadership. We look forward to pushing these areal density improvements into the majority of our products in FY 2016.","As the costs of NAND flash have come down over the last several quarters, customers have begun to recognize the combination and the value of combining non-volatile caches with HDDs. With the advantage of selling over 15 million hybrid drives under our belt, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive continued innovation and lead the industry in delivering the value that this combination of technology enables.","Revenue growth and customer qualification traction for our SSD controllers, solid-state drives and PCIe accelerator cards are on track to our milestones. Our recently announced partnership with Micron for our next-generation enterprise SAS in proceeding well and customer feedback has been favorable.","In addition, we\u2019re very happy with the close collaboration that we have with customers on application-specific tuning for SSDs in data center environments, underscoring the quality of our decisions in the M&A space over the last few years.","In the high-performance computing space, this past quarter saw major new wins with leading academic, public sector and private labs that combined represent more than 120 petabytes of storage capacity, equivalent to the amount of storage needed for 1600 years of HD video.","We also made first delivery of a massive scale-out storage system that when complete will achieve 1.7 terabytes per second while ingesting data, making that the fastest storage system in the world and it\u2019s built end to end on Seagate storage technology.","I\u2019m really pleased with the breadth of technical innovation that the Seagate engineering teams are delivering, while continuing to judiciously manage operating expenses during a period of dynamic market conditions. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank the entire global team for their continued efforts.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Luczo","Great, thanks, Dave. Turning to our business outlook, the long-term trends in data growth, big data analytics, machine to machine computing and public and private cloud deployments continued to progress in an encouraging manner. Seagate is expanding and investing in its storage technology product and solutions portfolio to align competitively with these market dynamics and capitalize on exabyte demand growth.","We remain optimistic that calendar year 2015 will provide significant opportunities to deepen our customer relationships, leverage our business model and return value to our shareholders. In the near-term, macroeconomic pressures in Europe and global currency fluctuations are continuing to have an effect on customers demand visibility.","While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it continues to be difficult to assess the degree of this impact will have on our client market customers, in addition to the timing of the release our Windows 10.","Overall demand in the enterprise market is relatively stable. And as we have expressed previously, the Nearline high-capacity drive market can exhibit variations quarter to quarter as cloud service providers drive higher utilization of storage capacity additions and others prepared for build-outs in the second half of the year. When you take a multi-quarter view of this market, the exponential demand for storage is evident as exabyte capacity shipments in 2014 were up 35% over the prior year.","From broad based discussions with customers, we currently believe that the addressable market in the June quarter will be relatively flat with the March quarter. We\u2019re targeting revenues for the June quarter of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and managing to a very lean production schedule.","Should macro conditions improve or PC builds accelerate with improved confidence in back to school demand, we could see upside to this forecast and we have the ability to flex up production as necessary. We will continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitably and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings.","For the June quarter, we anticipate margins of approximately 28.5%, taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We\u2019re targeting operating expenses at $555 million, as our core product portfolio refresh continues to be on track as well as timing of investments in our new market adjacencies.","Looking further ahead, we continue to believe that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half with demand coming from the PC market, seasonal gaming demand and continued stability in the enterprise market with potential upside from hyperscale deployments.","We\u2019re confident in the long-term dynamics of data growth and the opportunities ahead for Seagate in the storage technology market place in 2015 and beyond. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support.","I\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham & Company.","Richard Kugele","Couple of questions. First, can you comment on what you felt the TAM was in March, so we understand the base for June? And then secondly, just on the PCIe space, Nytro, there\u2019s been some competitors complaining that the PCIe market is losing mine share to SAS solutions and SATA solutions. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a competitive technology perspective in PCIe?","Steve Luczo","Richard, I\u2019ll have Dave answer the second question. But the first one is just assume, we believe held share in the quarter of about 40%, so that would translate into a TAM of call it 125 million, 126 million. Last quarter being early that we are \u2013 we made a guesstimate we were off by a few million units, I think, as it turns out, when everything rolled in, so we\u2019ll have to see what the other companies report. But our sense is we held share that would imply about 125 million, 126 million, something like that.","Dave Mosley","Relative to the PCIe space, what we\u2019re finding is that the customers who tend to buy these drives really want their applications accelerated in a very specific way, so there\u2019s a lot of deep understanding of the application that\u2019s required in order to get the design win and a lot of work with the customers specifically to make sure that it has traction across their entire install base when you install it.","There is a very healthy market out there right now for SATA and SAS going into existing plugs without that requirements of that tuning. And I wouldn\u2019t pick one against the other, although I\u2019d say that maybe some of the growth of the PCIe space was a little overblown in the past. It\u2019s very customer and application specific and there\u2019s a lot of work required in order to get that traction.","I think going forward, the idea that everything becomes the model where you just unplug what you have against one of those SAS or SATA plugs and plug in something new, it\u2019s probably not the right answer though, because I think there\u2019ll be architectural disruption on the software and hardware side that require further optimization. And on a lot of the PCIe space, obviously that time is money. The application acceleration that you can get means a lot to those customers and we\u2019ll continue to do that work.","Steve Luczo","So Richard, I think the comment about overblown, I think the point is that going back a few years when people were projecting how big they thought this market was and how fast it was growing, I don\u2019t think that has ever really been substantiated in terms of how these deployments really occur. And with respect to the specific question on our particular product and the traction we\u2019re gaining with customers, we find it to be quite positive when we don\u2019t really see some of the challenges that others have indicated.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel.","Aaron Rakers","Can you talk a little bit about, you made a comment about some optimization in the operating expense structure of your cloud solutions business, can you just remind us where you\u2019re at in terms of the ramp of the Xyratex business and whether or not you still see upside drivers of what you\u2019ve laid out in the past, I think, $650 million to $700 million, and then where you stand on realizing or how much maybe further cost optimization realization could be had from that piece of the business?","Steve Luczo","We\u2019re still expecting that, as things develop over the next call it one to three quarters that we\u2019re going to gain some confidence on increasing that profile on what we think the revenue opportunity is from the CSS business.","And on the margin side, we inherited a business that had a lot of good technology, but operationally probably hadn\u2019t had some of the investments that it needed to really be optimized and drive some of the efficiencies that we typically do on the drive side.","So we\u2019re actively using that operations capability that we have to push more efficiency and flexibility, which it\u2019s kind of a combination of trying to get the efficiency with the flexibility because these orders come in fairly dynamically with not a lot of time, sometimes to address these opportunity especially as we get near the end of the quarter, there\u2019s still kind of the systems mentality where stuff is very back-end loaded, which we\u2019re trying to address operationally as well as how we manage our inventory. So I think there\u2019s a fair amount of room there in terms of what we can do on the margin profile over the next one to two years.","Aaron Rakers","And how much of an overhang is that right now on your gross margin?","Steve Luczo","On the gross margin, I\u2019ll give you an estimate, it\u2019s hard to exactly split everything that we\u2019re doing, because we are an integrated leverage company. But I think at least 50 to 70 basis points.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner","Steve, considering the market was a bit weaker than I think most people expected going into the quarter, I was hoping if you could give us some commentary on what you saw in terms of pricing, it looks like your ASPs were up more \u2013 it looks like on like for like basis, they declined a little bit, so I was hoping to get some commentary?","Steve Luczo","Pricing was about as expected in the quarter, I\u2019ll let Rocky talk to it, but it was about as expected. We did have good mix up.","Albert Pimentel","I think as Steve said, the mix up was good. I think even in light of the fact this was kind of a seasonal hyperscale service provider consolidation period where their purchasing becomes a little more flattish, waiting for some of their expansion in the back half of the year was still strong year over year.","And I think the enterprise was pretty stable, certainly the client had pressure, but we tried to apply very disciplined methodology towards making the market at the low end of the drive portfolio. So I think we felt really good about the overall mix in the product portfolio. Certainly, I think it\u2019s a reflection of the value that we have going forward in the hyperscale new data center world we\u2019re going to see. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research.","Steve Fox","Just broadly speaking on your non-HDD business, it looked like it was roughly flat, if my numbers are right, quarter over quarter. I know there\u2019s seasonality in there, could you just talk about how your sales are tracking towards some of those long term goals you laid out? Is there any other positive surprises in non-HDD sales and if you\u2019re still targeting some of the leverage for next fiscal year?","Steve Luczo","We think we\u2019ll still on track. So all the businesses either hit their plan of records that we had or maybe slightly achieved our internal plans and feel good about the opportunity in the growth prospects that we provided previously.","Steve Fox","And then Steve just there\u2019s been a lot of M&A discussion in general around storage, I know you guys are always looking at stuff, is there anything, if nothing came out in terms of acquisitions over the next six to nine months, is there any reason to think that you\u2019re not \u2013 your portfolio isn\u2019t fully loaded for that growth profile or what do you have to go to continue to develop it beyond what you\u2019ve discussed so far?","Steve Luczo","I think we have the pieces we need to meet the growth profile. I think if you see us pursue M&A activities, it will either be to affect the margin profile in terms of the technology that we\u2019re providing to the customer or it will be to either expand market share or broaden the technology portfolio in another way that would gain greater revenue growth. So it could either be a play on the gross margin or could be a play on the revenue opportunity. But right now I think the assets that we have support the growth profile that we\u2019ve indicated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Two questions from me. I guess, one, could you just maybe talk about the enterprise business, especially the Nearline Drives, historically you\u2019ve had a few good quarters and you had a bit of a lull. So I\u2019m curious to what extent do you have good visibility in that business? And as you shift towards the 6 terabyte Nearline Drives, does that help, I\u2019m sure it helps the ASPs, but does that help your gross margin profile as well over there?","Albert Pimentel","Certainly the high end of the product portfolio always contributes to our gross margin and that was manifested in this quarter\u2019s strengthened gross margin despite the challenges we faced in revenue. I think our portfolio and as we\u2019ve talked about our 8 terabyte and beyond and Dave mentioned the strength of the hybrid program and things like that, I think we feel very positive about the prospects that the high end of the portfolio offer as we build forward throughout this year and then in the next year.","And I think with the partnership with Micron and working on hybrid programs in next-generation SSD solutions just broadens the non-HDD portfolio that Steve was asked about previously. So I think we feel really good about the opportunities we have in our toolbox to go forward over the next several years.","Amit Daryanani","I\u2019m just curious on the June quarter, it seems that TAM is going to be flat, the mix sounds like it\u2019s going to be fairly stable, so could you maybe point out what are the levers that are resulting in 40 basis points decline in the margin guidance that you guys are providing for gross margins?","Patrick O\u2019Malley","So you heard us we\u2019re going to try to manage the supply tightly this quarter and with that, we\u2019re going to run the factories probably not the optimal way. So we\u2019re planning some downside there. But as Steve and Rocky said, we\u2019re quickly poised to take advantage of any opportunity that comes to us and we could get some lift there. But we\u2019re just going to manage supply really tight this quarter. That manifests itself in a short term margin compression, but long term economic benefit by maintaining that supply. So it could be a little better, but we\u2019re managing the business really, really tight this quarter.","Albert Pimentel","I think to add on to Pat\u2019s comments there, the marginal profitability for gross margin on the marginal units that we may benefit from with any kind of upside in the quarter definitely would help us to improve the gross margin profile. But again, we\u2019re just modeling the outlook based on a somewhat cautious TAM I guess for lack of a better description.","Steve Luczo","So we probably have time for just a couple of more questions before market opens, we want to be respectful of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty","In the context of the flat TAM for the June quarter, can you just talk about what you\u2019re expecting for PCs versus enterprise versus cloud sequentially and then just your thoughts on Win 10 in the back half and how that impacts PC\u2019s seasonality this year?","Steve Luczo","I think actually all of the different markets seem to be at least as we\u2019re managing going into the quarter flat. I think where there is opportunity for the upside is probably on the PC side, depending again on the OEM\u2019s confidence about back to school pool, which I think they\u2019ll start deciding probably in the month of June. I think my guess is they probably got their build plans pretty set for April and May and June with one level of expectation about back to school which they\u2019re obviously going to prepare for.","And then I think if there\u2019s some shift in terms of what the macro conditions are, whether or not that\u2019s global or just more confidence about what\u2019s happening in the US, then you could see acceleration in June. So I think on the client side and maybe that\u2019s mostly a notebook comment, I think that\u2019s where there is some opportunity for something beyond flat.","There was also lot of inventory and supply chain adjustments in the March quarter that we don\u2019t have perfect visibility on, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the OEMs drew down inventories and limited their production. So this quarter, they probably have to catch up on the production side to meet even a flat demand or I guess maybe even imply a slight growth. So we\u2019re watching that closely.","As indicated on the Nearline side, it\u2019s really just a function of where are the big cloud service providers are in their capital deployment plans. Most as we would see it though, the acceleration is probably more in the September and the December quarter. And whether or not they pull anything into the June quarter just to smooth out that pool in September and December is I think where the opportunity might be there. And I think the other markets are relatively flat.","Katy Huberty","So is it fair to say your guidance does not assume a pickup in PCs in the month of June and that would be largely upside versus the guidance you provided?","Steve Luczo","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Katy Huberty","And then just Win 10 in the back half and how that impacts seasonality?","Steve Luczo","It should benefit it, but it seems to be a bit of unknown right now in terms of the timing. One more question and we should probably let everybody get to work.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Monika Garg of Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg","First question on the \u2013 could you talk about the visibility like your comment suggest that you expect pickup in demand for some hyperscale customers back half of calendar 2015, just wanted to check out those views.","Steve Luczo","So Monika you just want a view of the visibility from the customers, just want to make sure on hyperscale?","Monika Garg","Yeah, hyperscale customers, and do you expect pickup in demand in the back of calendar 2015?","Albert Pimentel","Yes. As Steve mentioned that hyperscale, the major global hyperscale service providers are all pretty strong in their dialog about their capital expansion in the second half of the year. And the question I think was posed earlier as to how do we see the June quarter and that\u2019s really \u2013 the opportunity is that the hyperscale providers accelerate their purchasing and start in like the June month, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to service, but we\u2019re trying to again maintain a cautious demeanor for the June quarter. But certainly, hyperscale providers present a very strong opportunity as we go into the back half of the year for sure.","Steve Luczo","Long lead signals for us would point towards at least 60\/40 split second half to first half in terms of the exabytes they\u2019re demanding and for some it\u2019s even greater. So again, it seems to be one of the phases where they\u2019re going to deploy pretty heavily and then they wait and fill it up and then they deploy again. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. That\u2019s obviously a function of their data growth needs, macro conditions, but right now that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing, 60\/40 or even a touch more.","Monika Garg","Just to follow, if my memory serves right, enterprise\u2026","Steve Luczo","We should wrap it up, we\u2019re at the market open. So we want to thank everyone for participating and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Okay, great, thanks everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Cash flow from operations was $938 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash. Through the extraordinary efforts of our suppliers and outstanding execution from our operations, Seagate successfully delivered our portfolio of products to a broad base of customers. We also returned significant value to our shareholders this quarter, with over $1.2 billion in dividends, share repurchases and debt repurchase. The 43.1 million share repurchased during the March quarter reflected approximately 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company.","We increased our unit shipments by 29% over last quarter, shipping 61 million drives, which equates to approximately 42 exabytes. Shipments of our client products improved, with the notebook market almost fully recovered, as expected. We expect the market for desktop drives to remain constrained, most likely through the fall. In the enterprise, the mission-critical market segment market seems to have almost fully recovered, while business-critical continues to be constrained as demand for storage continues to increase rapidly with the ongoing build out of the cloud infrastructure.","We believe we are well-positioned for these cloud-based trends because of our broad product portfolio, which represents several high-demand, sole-supply product offerings. Our Samsung label products represented approximately 13% of our shipments this quarter. We are very pleased with the value this business has brought to Seagate. We have increased manufacturing capacity and have successfully increased our additional design engineering headcount by over 25% at our Korean design center since the acquisition was completed.","Gross margin for the third quarter was 37%. As expected, pricing was relatively benign in the quarter and Seagate's operational performance exceeded our expectations, as we were able to ship units at an increasing average capacity per drive with improving yields. We believe our average capacity per drive was at least 15% higher than the industry average.","Our long-term agreements with our largest customers have been mutually successful and we delivered over 100% of our committed volume this quarter. The number of executed LTAs increased to 50% this quarter. We expect these long-term agreements to account for approximately 60% of our total production capacity for the calendar year. LTA pricing was more favorable to the customer than the company's average pricing, reflecting the benefit of longer-term visibility of supply and demand. Our new auction program continues to evolve and we held multiple auctions worldwide throughout the quarter, selling 100% of the products offered at or above the company's average pricing.","As the industry recovered during the quarter, supply to the distribution channel improved. Distribution pricing remains well above historical spreads with respect to OEM pricing. As the drive industry works towards bringing supply and demand into balance, there are several market dynamics that remained unsettled in addition to a variety of supply constraints that have resulted in our customers mixing down their capacity requirements. Most interesting is a possible market share shift in favor of OEMs versus white box manufacturers who fulfill through distribution. The longer-term implication of these adjustments is not entirely clear yet. Regardless, we believe there remains a substantial and growing shortfall in unmet exabyte demand resulting from the supply-chain disruptions caused by the floods.","Consistent with industry analyst projections, we believe that the June quarter TAM will be approximately 160 million units. Given these dynamics, the pricing environment remains benign and we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin expectation to be at least 34.5% for the June quarter. We expect to achieve revenue of at least $5 billion and operating expenses of approximately $400 million to $500 million. Fully diluted share count for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 440 million.","For the second half of the calendar year, we are planning that the industry will continue its current pace of recovery, and combined with the demand for cloud infrastructure and the introduction of Win 8 and new thin and light notebook products, the December quarter TAM should exceed 185 million units. Under these conditions, we believe Seagate will maintain market share of approximately 43% and will be on track to achieve calendar 2012 revenues of at least $20 billion. In addition, we are planning for non-GAAP gross margins to remain above 30% exiting calendar 2012.","With respect to our capital structure and priorities for cash, we expect to continue to return value to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and when appropriate, early retirement of debt. To the extent market and business conditions allow, we expect to continue the share repurchase at a pace to result in a basic share count of approximately 350 million shares by the end of the calendar year.","Melanie, we're now ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel Nicolaus.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question for me is that I believe last quarter, when you guys had talked about the forward expectations in the March quarter, you had assumed that the industry can produce about 130 million to 135 million drives. The industry shipped closer to 143 million. Can you help us understand the delta there? Did production come back on quicker than you had assumed or is there -- how do we think about the further burn down of the inventory in the supply chain?","Stephen J. Luczo","I think our estimates have been anywhere from, if I go back to October for the March, June, September, December 2012 quarters, anywhere from 140 million in March to 160 million in June to 180 million in September and 180 million to 190 million in December. I think when we had our call in January, the reason we were probably a little under the 140 million was that when we looked at the build rates for the first 3 weeks of January, it was extremely low. And we weren't -- it wasn't clear to us if the industry would be able to ramp to the 140 million or 140 million-plus that were shipped. And I think a lot of that was done by continuing mix down, which is done of course while addressing unit shortfall, which is good in terms of getting drives into our customers' hands, so we can keep demand overall strong. It's obviously addressing this exabyte shortage that we're focused on as well.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the follow-up question up for me is that, I'll ask it because somebody's going to ask you this, it sounds like you're going to host an Analyst Day in September. Is that the time frame in which we expect or are you willing now to throw anything out there in terms of the long-term gross margin target model that you've talked about in the past? And on top of that, is there any way to think about free cash flow generation in the context of what you guys are targeting and more comfortable in targeting through 2012?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think, clearly, by virtue of what we said today, we've indicated a strengthening of our position of what we think is going to happen through calendar 2012 relative to what we thought in January, both with respect to the June quarter margins, as well as exiting calendar year 2012. I think in terms of being in a better position at the Analyst Day to talk about the longer-term business model, absolutely, I think that we'll be in a position to do that by then, if not adding more color on the June quarter call.","Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And free cash flow?","Stephen J. Luczo","Same thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Steve, just going back to gross margin, could you give us -- with all the moving parts that you guys have with pricing and product cycles and capacity utilization increases, and adding Samsung, can you give us, I guess, 2 parts -- number one, what's the -- where the, I guess, the mix -- I guess the parts that have you kind of guide down a little bit, at least at the floor in June versus March. And then presumably as pricing starts to soften a little bit as we move through the year, how should we think about some of the other levers kind of layering in to support gross margin through the year?","Stephen J. Luczo","Right. Well, I guess I want to challenge that we guided down, we actually guided up relative to what we said in January. What we said in January is that we thought that the June quarter would be basically a minimum equal to what we guided in March, which was 33%, we're saying 34.5% now. Our performance in the March quarter was benefited by some really outstanding operational execution and we certainly hope to deliver on that in the June quarter as well. And if we do, then we will obviously outperform our plan of at least 34.5%. I think to your question of this is like, do you say potato, do I say potato, are margins going up, are margins going down? I think the things that are putting pressure on margins would be for us, as we continue to mix up our notebook product, and a lot of it is what we acquired from Samsung. Obviously, the notebook product pricing, so from an AUP perspective is lower than average. And then margins, we don't really talk about margins by products or markets. I'm not going to do that here. But there's also this issue that I try to point out between distribution and then the OEM distribution mix. So clearly, with the OE -- with the distribution price premium being significantly higher than historical norm right now, to the extent that distribution regains more of that white box share, then that would benefit our margins. To the extent that the OEMs continue to take share there, then that would obviously result in lower margins and we have our own view on how that all plays out, which is highly competitive. But when it's all said and done, that's how we get to our gross margin guidance. I think the other big thing, is what you hit, is we're working through some product transitions here that are pretty significant. We've really transitioned the entire portfolio over the last 6 months, which again, I think is a real statement of the company's performance operationally to not only were we chasing a supply chain that was severely disrupted but we actually were transitioning probably with the hardest technical transitions that the industry has gone through. And as we do that, as you know, that allows us to obviously have margin relief. And so as we mix up in either capacity or as we mix to the newer products and then as yields grow on those products, that would obviously benefit margins. So you got all the triggers of net-net, which ones influence the margins, which way, and our modeling basically results in the guidance that we gave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Eric Sterling for Ben. I just have a quick question on the dividend. In thinking about the shrinking of the share count, your cash outlay actually declined. So can you just sort of give some thoughts around how you're planning for the dividend throughout the year? Is there any thought around increasing it?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well that's a discussion that we had at the board level. But I think we've been pretty consistent in what we've said, that we believe that a combination of buyback and dividend payment is an appropriate thing to do in terms of returning value to the shareholders. And I think we've also said that we think the concept of a payout ratio is one that makes sense. So by that sense, you're right. As we reduced our share count, it gives us more flexibility to increase the dividend. And that will be a discussion topic for the board to consider.","Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I just have another question. In the release, at the end, there's actually a comment about building about 10 drives per second, which kind of implies a June quarter TAM of 79 million if taken literally. Is that sort of a number that you're comfortable with? Or am I just kind of reading too much into it?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think you're just taking a statement that we were trying to make in terms of the operational efficiency of the company and extending it through the entire quarter. So I think the point was, as we recovered in the March quarter, obviously our production was skewed. And at the end of the quarter, we were able to reach those kinds of efficiencies. We balance the supply with the demand, so we've already told you what we think the TAM is and what we think our market share is. So we'll be targeting our production and make sure supply and demand is in balance, not trying to optimize as many drives per second as we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I had 2 questions related, Steve, to what you're just talking about. The first one is when you mentioned the exit December quarter rate TAM. I just wanted to clarify that, you talked about 185 million drives, I think. That's where you think the industry will be and in terms of its production capacity at that point?","Stephen J. Luczo","I think what I said was that we believe there'd be a minimum of 185 million units and we tend to look to the industry analysts who are in the business of providing TAM estimates. We're one input to that, we obviously watch it very closely. But given some of the trends that we talked about in terms of cloud-based computing, the proliferation of a variety of mobile devices that drive storage up and down the device food chain, as well as Win 8 and thin and light, that we believe that a minimum of 185 million unit TAM is achievable for December. I think the industry analysts, frankly, are probably a bit above that. In terms of the drive industry's ability to respond to that, there's the drive companies and then there's the drive industry, and I'll let Dave talk to it. I think that's probably pushing the limit, but I'll let Dave talk to that in terms of what the industry can support.","William David Mosley","Really gets into the specifics of which products we're talking about. So different markets, different products have many different dynamics. I think, like Steve alluded to, the box count has gone up but the average gigabyte per drive in the industry went down appreciably as a function of this mix down to basically chase that because there was such a dearth of total HDDs in the past 6 months. Now going forward, the question is does that dynamic continue to --  at those low capacity points, if you will? Or do we start to grow up the value chain for more capacity in those sort of boxes? And then obviously with the cloud growing, those are high-capacity drives as well. So I think we'll be mixing up our components available to be able to do that. I, personally, just knowing the supply chain the way I do, I don't feel that numbers that are much more than that are really capable -- the industry is really capable of. There are a number of components still have yet to recover as a function of the flood.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If I could just ask a follow-up then. Steve, when you talked about pricing will be benign in the June quarter, is there any color you can give us on some specifics on either like-for-like or weighted average pricing for the June quarter?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","This is Pat. We've gone through negotiations. Generally, we've indicated that prices are going to be relatively flat. But as Steve said, as the channel moves, we'll be competitive there. We're still very competitive. But if you look at historical rates, Keith, I'll just say benign is below that. So that's how we should look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions about the enterprise and notebook markets, if I could. Given the commentary about basically meeting supply and demand in the quarter for those 2 segments in particular, can you just talk about with the customers that have signed LTAs, how their behavior was at the moment of balance? The market's very concerned that as soon as things get into balance, that you're going to see dramatic pricing pressure or backing away from the LTAs. So any commentary from a high level on those 2 segments given the fact that we've seen supply and demand balance in those areas?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think we already commented on pricing, Rich. I mean, pricing is effectively done for the LTA customers for the June quarter. And as Pat just indicated, there's been little change to no change in pricing overall. I would say that the behavior through the quarter is there's been a lot of continued chasing of demand, even in those 2 segments. What we've noticed is the LTA customers seem to be taking share and what's really interesting is the LTA customers with the longer-term LTAs seem to be even taking more share. And that may be a function of their ability to do some longer-range planning knowing that they have the supply available, particularly in some of these product categories where Seagate is a sole supplier and is likely to be a sole supplier for anywhere up to 12 to 18 months. So I'd say, in general, as notebook came into balance, the pricing has remained fairly stable and certainly, the same thing in mission-critical business grew [ph]. And I think pricing is really a function of an industry that has a lot of capital to recover, probably at least a couple of billion dollars have to be reabsorbed into the industry, and the supply chain is still not functioning anywhere near where we need it to be functioning, and that's our job through the rest of this year as an industry, is to be able to more closely align supply and demand with our customers' needs.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And just lastly then, on the CapEx front, you talked about in the prepared remarks, that your CapEx would be, for the quarter, below your targeted range. How long do you think you can maintain that level? There's got to be some base level of just maintenance, right? But how long do you think you can go before you might have to expand capacity?","William David Mosley","Rich, this is Dave. I think we'll do pretty well at the levels that were at, low end of the range we said 6% to 8%. That will be at the low end of the range. Until we really see a big pop in the TAM, and I think everybody's fairly conservative relative to that macroeconomically. We are through the bulk of this product transition that we talked about. So most of the technology transition, capital that we have to put in place is already in place. There will be some of what you referenced but it's more of that kind of run rate level that we're at right now. And we'll spend as we see the need for it within the lead time, but nothing major to take us up to the high end of the range, certainly.","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And actually, one for Pat. Just on the authorization of the stock buyback, how much is left on that?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","As of today, Rich, we authorized an additional $1 billion in the last quarter. With that -- we have made the announcement. We've just now entered into that phase. So we have $1 billion left of all authorizations in front of us. And as Steve suggested about the capital structure, we have ongoing discussions every quarter with the board and they'll continue to look at that on what the appropriate authorizations are to get us to 350 million...","Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So is that $1 billion as of April 1 or of today?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Today. As of today.","Stephen J. Luczo","Rich, just on the pricing thing, back, I'm not sure that you caught the point on, first of all, the LTA pricing is below the company's average. The LTA customers are benefiting from our ability to line up our factories efficiently to meet the demand they're putting in front of us on a scheduled basis, which means then we can obviously deliver some of that cost savings to them. It's evidenced by a lower price to them. In addition, you need to recognize that we're overshipping the industry average capacity by 15%. So when you take the overall AUP deltas, either on average or if you then even apply it to the LTA customer, and then also take into effect the capacity difference, I mean, there is a very substantial savings to the LTA customer right now in terms of the pricing they're receiving.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions, please. First of all, is there a way to put mix aside and talk about your manufacturing efficiencies exiting the quarter, versus, say, pre-flood levels? How much more improvements do you think you have to make relative to the supply chain and just your own internal production? And then secondly, Pat, could you just talk about your receivable days and it spiked up a little bit during the quarter versus sales growth. Where do you expect to see that, say, exiting the June quarter?","William David Mosley","Steven, this is Dave. I'll handle the new product yields first. Actually, we made appreciable progress in the last 6 months. While some of the time was, I'll say, slow time in manufacturing because of the flood, the new product yields improved quite substantially. I'm not happy. I'm never going to be totally happy with them but they're way ahead of plan right now and that's flowing through our numbers quite a bit. Are we done yet? There's a couple of product transitions that I think we still have yet to finish but I'd say, like we talked about last quarter, mission-critical, business-critical, those are the product transitions are complete now. The desktop transition is largely complete and we'll balance that as time goes on. And then notebook products are still in the process of transitioning. The notebook yields, though, I'm very happy with the progress we've made last quarter. So mix aside, I think in these products we're doing well.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","But, in aggregate, you're saying there's more room to improve efficiency, say, over the next couple of quarters?","William David Mosley","Always, yes. I certainly think so. I mean, we still are not at some of the historical levels that I want to be at on some of these new products so there's work to do.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","And then just, Pat, on the receivables?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","As Steve alluded to about the January, when we looked at January production and as Dave talked about how we got much more operationally efficient, it was a great quarter from that aspect, but as you can imagine with that, we delivered a lot of product towards the end just because that's when it was coming online. So a lot of this was driven from linearity, not really Ts and Cs or anything like that. So I'd certainly target as we go through our growth curve, to get back to steady-state, that would be sub-50 and closer to historical, about 48 days. So I would expect to get those days working capital back, but this as a function of linearity and sort of the growth projection we had throughout the quarter.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","And is that a reasonable target exiting June or is it going to take longer?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","I think that's what we'd target to. I mean, June's always a fun quarter. But I think, as Dave's run the factory as it is [ph], I think we certain -- should target under 50 because it's running much more linear this quarter than it was last quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last question. First, I understand you saw operational efficiencies as you moved through the quarter, but did you also see some improvement in demand and pulls from your OEM customers that would be constructive on the overall demand environment moving into June?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, again, I don't want to talk too specifically about customers. I already made a comment about customers sets [ph], where we do believe that the OEMs are at least in this environment, taking share probably from the white box companies. So we did see that as an improvement in the quarter, Katy, because I don't think we had planned aggressively for it at the beginning of the quarter. And I think as the quarter evolves and they're gaining more confidence that, that may be a more sustainable share shift, then, yes, we do see strength there and that's one of the reasons I think that even for some of our products like in the notebook segment, we were continuing to chase demand for LTA customers through the quarter. And that's why I was saying in the scripted part of the call, that depending on how that plays out in the near term and long term, it may be kind of a structural shift that -- in our customer base that we'll have to adjust to.","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Pat, as DSOs normalize in the June quarter, can we get back to that $1 billion-plus quarterly free cash flow target that you had said back in January?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Yes, absolutely. I mean, right now, as you can imagine it, we're growing through the -- from going from 40 million units, to plus 60 to plus 70, we're chewing up working capital going there. But that's -- once it gets into, as Steve talked, as TAM stabilizes, our share stabilizes, we can run a fairly stable model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could just ask a question on mission-critical, you said units were good and you said the industry looks almost fully recovered. I recognize it's not the easiest time to be probably looking at long-term trends. But if you look forward there, when you combine flash at the high end and then near-line growth, which has been obviously there's a lot more demand probably than supply right now at the low end, I mean, do you think of that mission-critical, traditional, 10K certainly 15K market being a growth market looking forward? Or is this kind of -- how do you look at that kind of beyond the next couple of quarters? Is there positive growth, negative growth?","Stephen J. Luczo","No, I think absolutely it's a growth market. I mean the enterprise -- the strain on the enterprise numbers, regardless of how you split it between mission-critical and business-critical, which gets  in the probably [ph] more art than science at this point. That's where all the petabyte growth is and whether or not it is private or public clouds to changing infrastructure that is back-end storage weighted. And as long as bandwidth keeps opening up, that's the architectural shift that's probably going to occur. So I think there's absolutely big growth and whether or not it's some sliver or Tier 0, that's SSD or bigger piece of Tier 0 that's hybrid or the rest of it, which is 95% of it, which is going to be rotating mass storage. That's just the big petabyte growth requirement that we're going to be chasing hard as an industry. In the enterprise, those numbers are probably in the 40% to 50% annual growth rates and their density growth, as you know, is half that. So that's a big puzzle for the industry to solve. And therefore, I think the demand requirements in the supply demand and balance is going to be something we're chasing for a while.","Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And within business-critical, do you see that as something that the industry gets back to recovery coming out of the June quarter or is that still you think a couple more quarters, because it seems to be still the tightest?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, it's hard for us to say because we're uniquely positioned there with a couple of products that are in very high demand that I mentioned, we're sole supplier on and just, architecturally, we will be for a good period of time. So there's a lot of growth in the cloud in the near-line business-critical space in general and then for our products in particular. So we're going to be running hard to meet that demand, I think, certainly through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Yoo with Citi.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, I just wanted to get, I guess, back to the gross margin question. There has been some concerns that you are incurring some additional costs as you try to help the supply-chain in Thailand recover. I was just wondering how -- if any were of an impact to the gross margin that you posted this quarter and then if anything is embedded in the June quarter guidance?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes, I mean, absolutely. We've done a lot to support the supply base in different forms that some of which have hit the gross margin line as you indicate. And yes, I mean, this is back to the point, this is a structural change and so we believe that will be structurally in place. This is how our industry supply-chain recovers and there's going to be costs that get capitalized throughout the supply chain that's going to be have to be absorbed by us and our Downstream customers. And that's the reality of a structural change. I don't know Dave, if you want to add anything else.","William David Mosley","I'll just say that the suppliers, in general, have done a nice job of trying to recover the volumes as well, which helps them quite a bit as they're pulling that structure back together as well.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess more specifically, I'm just looking at the guidance and obviously, you want to provide a range, a pretty wide range, but just taking really the conservative route and going to 34.5%, a lot of what Steve has mentioned is actually positive. We could make a good case that gross margins could actually expand sequentially. So I'm trying to get a handle on what...","Stephen J. Luczo","That's why we raised the minimum from 33% to 34.5%, Joe.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I mean, what is the biggest concern to gross margins, I guess, more directly to the June quarter?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","I don't think it's concern as much as sort of opting...","Stephen J. Luczo","I guess I'm not understanding the question, Joe. We just said we raised our minimum guidance from 33% to 34.5%.","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I understand that and that's well taken. It's just that you posted 37.5% and you're saying at least 34.5% but as you know, a lot of people will just interpret that as 34.5%.","Stephen J. Luczo","I'm not going to get in a dialogue about what people are going to say. We said, our minimum is 34.5% and we also gave you the pieces of what could put pressure on margin. I think it was the very first question. I don't know if you were on the call or not. If you weren't, I'll just repeat it briefly. One is that there seems to be a shift going on right now between OEMs and distribution. That's not clearly understood in terms of how long it's going to last. But to the extent that it's a more permanent shift and given the fact that distribution pricing is substantially higher than OEM, then that would obviously reduce in the lower margin structure. At Seagate, because of our share gains in notebook, as a result of the Samsung acquisition, our mix is basically increasing more notebook drives and that's putting margin pressure on us as well. And then to your point, we hope to offset that with mix up and with yield improvement. Did I miss anything?","Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Fair enough. The other question's on share repo, to Pat, I wanted to get a sense of what -- how you see the pace of share repo for the next 3 quarters. Obviously, you bought a lot more than the normal pace in the first quarter -- first calendar quarter. So just get a gauge of how you plan to pace for the next 3 quarters.","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","Well, we target 350 million by the year end, if you want to do a linear basis, you can certainly model for that. That's probably the best way. I'm not looking to super time market. We have a plan in place, a structured plan, and we've been pretty regular about those purchases. So that would be the way I'd model it. Sometimes you might see a little different, but it's modeling a linear base is probably the fairest way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Noble.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to talk about this margin situation. You said that Samsung is going to try to be reducing them, but if you internally supply heads and media to Samsung in the long-term, won't that be a significant boost?","Stephen J. Luczo","We don't disclose what our long-term plans are with respect to internal heads and media, other than the high-level numbers that we give, Mark. As you know that today, those are heads that are supplied by TDK, you're right. I think you're also aware that we have a pretty significant partnership with TDK going forward and we expect to continue that. So all of that is taken into consideration. But I think the point more about Samsung was, is that overall, notebook margins are probably not the highest margin business that the carry, so to the extent that we increase our relative exposure there, that could put pressure on margins.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","There has been some debate recently, but you said the inventories in the channel are still fairly modest. Could you give us in terms of weeks, is it a week? Is it 2 weeks currently?","Stephen J. Luczo","I think it's hard to say because it was so back-end skewed. The channel is kind of like the last customer base, if you will, to kind of get a flow of drive certainly from Seagate as we supported our LTA customers. And again, I think there's also this issue around, how much of the channel business is being fulfilled by the systems vendor. So it's not really a comment on the health of our channel partners because they're fine. They can either take drives and motherboards and sell them to white box companies or they can ship whole systems and there might be an argument that says they actually like shipping whole systems better. I think with the price deltas at the component level that we've seen going into the channel, that's provided an opportunity for the OEMs, and especially for the OEMs that have had supply visibility through the LTAs to gain share. How that plays out, I think, is a good question and we're just going to have to watch it. That's one of the issues around, if you will, supply in the channel. So we're watching it very closely and to the extent that we feel that the channel isn't moving the product, then we'll probably see that in the OEM side, because clearly, at the end of the day, all those bars and systems integrators need disk drives.","Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Just finally, would it be fair to say that the channel's certainly below seasonable norms for this time of the year?","Stephen J. Luczo","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two question on the OpEx for Pat. Pat, can you maybe take us through what sort of leverage you think you can get on the OpEx line here as you continue to move forward? And then secondly, maybe for Steve, from an Ultrabook perspective, if you want to call them that or thin and light, whatever the right terminology is, when do you think the hybrids really start to penetrate that market from a timing perspective?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","On the OpEx, I think, actually we've leveraged it fairly well. We take a very minimal expense with the Samsung team and add that revenue fairly effectively. So at that $400 million level, I wouldn't say that's a high watermark, but we'll certainly target that model over the coming months to probably a year. And so there's some leverage capabilities in there but I think we've done a pretty good job in there. So we're not really looking to tune that up and shed anything significantly. In fact, we'd probably look at areas that we might need to make more investment but I think we could fit in that range of that $400 million. So I don't think that's anything that we're looking to take a big step function down.","Stephen J. Luczo","I think in terms of thin and light, that we do believe that obviously is kind of a next generation of the notebook the next incarnation of the notebook. And we believe it's going to be a very successful form factor of product. And hybrid probably plays a very big role there and when that happens is clearly a function of when you can get MLC flash working in those products. Because then you're at a cost difference that's pretty compelling in terms of versus an SSD and the performance differential being negligible. And when does that happen, I think it starts happening at the end of this year, but in terms of volume shipments and adaptation, I think you're looking at calendar 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A few questions. First, have you ever given us the breakdown in terms of the LTAs? What's the composition of OEM versus distribution?","Patrick J. O\u2019Malley","No, we haven't but we just characterize the vast majority of our top customers, which you would think of large OEMs. But that's how we'd characterize it and I think that's probably the best way to think about it.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then within that composition of being primarily OEM, has there been any one OEM or another that's take on a greater or less of that composition over the last, call it, 2 months? In terms of changes?","Stephen J. Luczo","What do you mean? I'm sorry.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let's say OEM A, maybe at one time they were 15% of the total base. Now they need a lot more from you. Now they sign on for even more LTAs. Now they're suddenly like 35% or 40% of that base. Are you seeing any sort of outsized changes or is it pretty linear?","Stephen J. Luczo","So there were different volume commitments by Seagate to different OEMs, which represented different percentages of what that OEM buys. So you're talking about percentages and absolute numbers here. So in some cases, we could have had a lower percentage but a bigger absolute number than this other guy that had a higher percentage, but a lower absolute number, right, depending on how big that customer was. The question is, have we seen general increase in demand by those LTA customers? And the answer is, yes. Has that been relatively stronger with certain customers than others? And the answer is, yes.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I could do a follow-up to the yes and yes part. Within that context, are there any customers who are taking on more of the lower capacity versus higher capacity? I think probably at the lower capacity...","Stephen J. Luczo","No.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm trying to get a sense in terms of gross margin  overage -- are you getting a better benefit from some of these customers versus others because of their shift to the lower capacity versus high-capacity or vice versa?","Stephen J. Luczo","No.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then as far as just looking out here, trying to get a sense in terms of the significant amount of cash flow that Seagate has been generating. Do you guys feel that there's a need to accelerate some of these advanced technologies, pulling forward some of that move to hammer and other stuff just because you have such a great market position and cash flow position? Or is that kind of getting too cute?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I don't know if it's getting too cute. I think it's just we're advancing those technologies as fast as we can right now. We weren't R&D expense or capital limited prior to this to driving that technology as fast as the technology will allow it to be driven. So we're still on that pace. I think the different question might be is there other technologies maybe not related to HDDs that we're looking at? That's a different question. But with respect to HDD technologies, it hasn't really changed the pace or the amount of investment that we're putting into our core underlying technologies or into our product development.","Kate Scolnick","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about auctions, just some more color. What you learned? How frequent they'll be? And is it fair to assume that these auctions would impact the OEM distributor dynamic you talked about, Steve?","Stephen J. Luczo","I'll let Rocky talk to you. Let me just give a general answer. I think it's -- this is still something that we're learning and we expect to kind of continue to learn from over a period of time. And so every quarter, we're trying something slightly different to see what works for us and what works for our customer. We get the feedback from our customers in terms of what they liked and what they didn't like and we try to make adjustments. And as a result of that, I don't think we want to get in a position of saying we're going to have fewer than or more than or whatever quarter-to-quarter because it really still is a learning process here. But in general, we've been very pleased with the results, both in terms of what we have learned every auction. You go into it expecting certain things. A lot of times you are right, sometimes you're wrong. You get to learn a few things you are wrong about. And I think in terms of validating that the marginal price of this technology is quite valuable. It's been proven out. And today, that's been done with products that maybe are not as scarce as some of our other products that we might auction going forward. So we get a better sense about the margin, what are some of our products worth that are very high demand. These are all the elements that we're testing out. And Rocky, would you want to add to that?","Albert A. Pimentel","Yes. It's an indication there. We're pretty excited about the results of the auctions we held this quarter. I would say that they exceeded our, going into the quarter, expectations. I think it's an indication of sort of creative thought that we continue to perpetuate across the management team at Seagate, developing a whole new sales channel that we see longer-term becomes an important information gathering point, as well as indicator around the market and the products we're offering. I think also we'll see it as a key tool in some of the spot market characteristics and behaviors, we'll have a better understanding of, as Steve talked about, the marginal value of key products, as well as what the behavior in the market is. So we're pretty excited about using this, one, again as another sales channel and two, as a realtime dynamic information validation tool.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And last question for me on Toshiba, they're obviously going to benefit from some regulatory stipulations here recently, but what are you seeing now and what do you expect? And is it still fair to assume a longer-term percent of the market at around 20% by units approximately?","Stephen J. Luczo","Well, I think it's tough, especially if the TAM plays out to the 185 million going to 200 million in the next year, let's call it. That's 20% of that number is a long way away from where they're at today, which is a fairly substantial capital investment, which it's not clear that the parent companies' choices are going to be optimized around disk drive given all the other pressures that the Toshiba Corporation has relative to its competitive footprint on its real business. That being said, I think Toshiba is a very tough competitor. They do very well with certain products and we expect that they're going to continue to be a relevant player in the tune of 14% to 16% market share, which is still a nice business. But I think it's a little hard to see where the capital would come from to grow it to the numbers you're talking about. That would be 40 million units a quarter. That's a long way from home.","All right. Thanks, everyone. I just wanted to comment that the company's performance during this unprecedented time has really put us on a course for continuing success and I really want to thank our employees and our customers, our partners and especially, our suppliers, as they work with us to recover, for their continued hard work and perseverance. We look forward to updating you on our longer-term strategic plan at our Analyst and Investor Meeting on September 21.

Please note we have combined our supplemental data and CFO commentary into one document. During today\u2019s call, we will review the highlights from the September quarter and provide the company\u2019s outlook for the fiscal second quarter 2014. After that, we will open up for questions.","As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements related to the company\u2019s historical and currently anticipated future operating and financial performance in the December quarter and thereafter and includes statements regarding customer demand and general market conditions.

Please go ahead Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thank you Kate. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Seagate demonstrated excellent execution this quarter and achieved revenues of $3.5 billion and on a non-GAAP basis gross margin of 28.5%, net income of $473 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.29. We had a strong cash flow quarter generating operating cash flow of $682 million and free cash flow of $521 million. In terms of our product portfolio we shipped a record 48.7 exabytes of storage, up 14% year-over-year and averaged a record 875 gigabytes per drive across our portfolio, up 19% over last year.","Our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15.1% in inventory turns and day sales outstanding were within our targeted ranges. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and investments, and during the September quarter S&P raised its corporate rating on Seagate to BB+ further reflection our strong financial position.","Returning value to shareholders through share redemptions and dividends remains a top priority for Seagate. In early October, we completed a private share redemption transaction with Samsung of 32.7 million shares for $1.5 billion. In addition, our Board last week approved raising our quarterly dividend $0.05 or 13% to $0.43 per share.","Through these activities, we expect to meet our goal of returning approximately 70% of operating cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year. At our strategic update in September, we discussed the major dynamics we see in the storage industry and the expanding and changing opportunities for Seagate in mobile, cloud, and open source computing. Looking out to 2020, we believe that data growth and demand for storage is continuing at a pace that is higher than what the drive industry infrastructure is capable to produce, and we estimate that approximately 60% of this data will be stored in both home and enterprise cloud environments.","Seagate\u2019s research and development is focused on advancing our product offerings to align with these emerging market trends. Some recent examples of our R&D success include our 4 terabyte nearline product delivering a competitive combination of capacity and energy efficiency, the storage industry\u2019s first enterprise and desktop hybrid drives, and enterprise level NAS offering leveraging are LaCie software expertise, and the announcement of our Seagate Kinetic Open Storage Platform designed to simplify data management and improve performance and scalability while lowering the total cost of ownership of cloud computing.","Developing products that our customers value and which solves their storage needs is one of our highest priorities, and we believe we have a very competitive portfolio from traditional HDDs to the highest performance flash-based enterprise products. We also continue to focus development efforts on improving magnetic recording aerial density. We\u2019re leading the transition to Shingled magnetic recording technology or SMR and are currently shipping drives utilizing this technology in significant volume. We will be incorporating this technology into additional products over the coming year. In addition, we\u2019re integrating flash technology across our product portfolio, and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we\u2019re seeing in our solid state hybrid drives as well as our enterprise SSD products.","For the September quarter, non-GAAP product margins were 28.5% reflecting market demand for our storage portfolio, effective supply chain management, and cost improvements. Maintaining margins within our long-term target range of 27% to 32% will continue to enable us to further invest in advancing our storage technology and manufacturing efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses this quarter were $469 million within our targeted range of 12% to 14% of revenue and reflecting investments in our core infrastructure and aligning our organization for our cloud, mobile, open source, and flash technology opportunities.","Turning to our December quarter outlook, we see the revenue and unit demand environment remaining relatively similar to what we have seen in the last several quarters. While global macroeconomic conditions and technology transitions continue to provide a level of uncertainty with our customers, we are mindful of those factors and we are confident that we can continue to execute effectively. For the December quarter, we expect revenues of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin relatively flat sequentially.","Seagate is well-positioned for this era of ongoing data growth and technology transformation, and we will continue to focus on executing to our financial model and delivering strong operating results. I am pleased with our performance this quarter, and on behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their solid performance and thank our customers, partners, and suppliers for their support and commitment. And before we open the call for questions, I want to take a moment and acknowledge the well-deserved executive promotions we announced today. Rocky Pimentel named President, Global Markets and Customers and Dave Mosley named President, Operations and Technology. By elevating Dave and Rocky to lead our core product technology operations and customer engagement, Seagate is even better positioned for continued operational excellence and to further our ability to capitalize on our growing opportunities in the storage marketplace. This new leadership alignment also allows me to focus more on the long-term strategic opportunities for our company and to increase my efforts around accelerating our mobile and cloud technology strategies. I am pleased to continue to be Chairman and CEO of Seagate, and I have no plans to leave the company anytime soon.","Regina, we are now ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon guys. Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk about the buyback program as you go forward and given the repurchase of shares from Samsung, what implications does it have to the Section 382 limitations that you have on your buyback as you go through the next 12 months?","Steve Luczo","Well, the Samsung shares were not subject to the 382 restrictions. And as you may know, and I will have Pat go into this in a little more detail, the 382 requirements were changed a little bit in a mode that makes it more favorable for Seagate in terms of giving us more flexibility quarter-to-quarter. So the buyback redemption from Samsung didn\u2019t affect us, and the 382 changes provide us a little more flexibility going forward.","Pat O\u2019Malley","Yes, with the recent IRS relaxation or amendment of the 382, companies like Seagate have been buying back their shares were in the same ilk of other companies buying other companies. So, we got relaxation on that. So, now the 382 should not be a gate or anything like that buying back our shares. So, our buying back redemption of shares will be totally a function of the cash flow generated by the entity.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. Thank you. And then maybe if you can just touch on ASP declines that you had sequentially of about $1 to \u2013 it sounds like I am assuming it might be more due to the consumer side of the business, but maybe if you could talk about it on a like-for-like basis, what did you see in terms of pricing in September quarter and how do you expect that to shake out in December quarter? Thank you.","Pat O\u2019Malley","Less than 2%, we expect that environment to continue on a like-for-like basis not mix of course, but like-for-like.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. Just wonder if I could get a little bit more color your SMR drives, your competitor launched a 7-platter helium drive that\u2019s expected to come out this quarter with one use case definitely targeted at the cloud. So do you think your drives leveraging SMR will be effectively positioned against those drives in both cloud and enterprise?","Steve Luczo","Yes. We are pretty confident in our cloud near line portfolio right now, and we look forward to the product launches that are coming next year.","Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then just a last follow-up on gross margin, it certainly came in a little bit higher, and I don\u2019t think you guided flat, you said so, I guess can you just talk about what drove that up this quarter and why you think it\u2019s going to just continue to remain flatter, is that just a matter of mix?","Steve Luczo","I will let Rocky go into that in a little detail and Dave would just give some macro thoughts, this is Steve. One is we have continued to emphasize our focus on quality of revenue. So we are starting to focus a lot more in revenue market share and exabyte market share, and we feel that in certain segments it just didn\u2019t make sense to participate given the rather lackluster revenue boost that would have provided maybe margin pressure. So, I think part of it is that we were selective in the business we pursued from a margin perspective. Rocky will talk to that a little bit more in terms of quality of share, and then the operating side, the factory has really performed extremely well. So we had some really great execution from Dave\u2019s organization and he can go into a little bit more detail following Rocky.","Rocky Pimentel","So I think to echo Steve\u2019s comments, you know, there has been a lot of operational go-to-market discipline that we have tried to build over the last several quarters through processes and behavior, and you know we\u2019re focusing on preserving or gaining share in those key categories of the portfolio that give us margin leverage and being very disciplined at the low end of the portfolio where you know the competition is maybe looking for volume upticks, et cetera. So anyway that gives you the color on it.","Steve Luczo","And from the operations perspective, we continue to manage the things that are under our control scrap and freight lanes and warranty and things like that very well, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the portfolio we have and we keep driving it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","First one here is could you maybe kind of talk about the momentum you see from your cloud or web scale customers buying directly from you guys and maybe if you could provide some idea of how much revenue \u2013 your enterprise revenues from these kind of segments?","Pat O\u2019Malley","I will just again, let me just say you know generally the purchases by the cloud service providers or Internet service providers or any other big web based companies are they are very choppy, and we\u2019ve said that over the last several quarters these large volume orders, but they tend to come and go in big blocks, and sometimes those companies are buying from our traditional OEMs and sometimes they shift their purchasing to direct kind of depending on what type of architectures they are deploying. So, I think it's a bit early to kind of get a read on how that\u2019s going to play out consistently, in fact it's my personal belief that the traditional OEMs are probably going to reestablish themselves pretty effectively in this marketplace just because of their go to market capability, so it's dynamic and it's choppy, and then I can let Rocky talk a bit about how we view what percentage of our drives go into what I just think of cloud-based architectures.","Rocky Pimentel","Yeah I think we were really pleased this last quarter despite in the cloud market some softness overall, we were able to gain market share in some of the key categories, and we talked a few quarters ago about estimating our cloud business at somewhere around 10% to 12% and now it\u2019s continued to escalate, and probably 15% to 20% because some of it is direct and some of it is indirect, but we\u2019re really seeing a lot of traction and with our recently announced kinetic drive, we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from all the key cloud customers across the globe, and I think we\u2019re continuing to build a great relationship with all those key customers to give us a preferred competitive position.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","And last one from me regarding your hybrid enterprise drive, could you maybe talk about the traction you see in the market and kind of where you think the group could be in that segment?","Steve Luczo","Yes so, we've had a limited release of the enterprise hybrid drive with couple of our key OEM customers, but it is benchmarking really well. It's particularly as we noted against our 15,000 RPM class drive in the marketplace, so as we continue to kind of uptick the marketing effort with our key OEM customers, we see that continue to grow for the foreseeable future. We were really satisfied as well in our desktop hybrid introductions and then in our client class commercial class hybrid drives meaning we crossed over 1 million units this quarter of shipments and see that continue to grow as an important part of the client compute part of the TAM basically.","Operator","It's from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","Can we go a little bit more into what\u2019s underpinning the guidance of effectively flat Q-on-Q market by segment, and then maybe I might have a follow-up on that?","Steve Luczo","So, we generally don\u2019t break it up by segment, but just if you take a look at the \u2013 even going back the last eight quarters, we have been running above our new target range of 27% to 32%, so \u2013 but while that period has been going on, the visibility is nothing stronger than it has been in the past. So we are in a world that has limited visibility. We are playing in the world that\u2019s relatively flat on unit, but growth in exabytes and that\u2019s how we are taking the approach of business. We are going after the quality of revenue. We are trying to manage the business accordingly and deploy capital appropriately. So that\u2019s the world we are living in and that\u2019s the world we are operating in.","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","Okay. And then within that context, would you be expecting flattish going out on to calendar year as well, and also given that you typically see seasonality in the December quarter and looking at the year ago compares where you had the iPad Mini being significantly cannibalistic, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any new tablets cannibalistic device. Is there an opportunity for upside do you feel or do you feel that this is actually an aggressive target basically?","Steve Luczo","It seems like you are focused on unit TAMs still, is that right?","Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research","Yes, yes, I am sorry, I am sorry that\u2019s with respect to unit TAMs.","Steve Luczo","That\u2019s not the only world you are talking about. Again, that\u2019s not the only world we think about. So we think unit TAM probably trends as it has over the last several quarters, which seems to be this kind of 140 give or take like we said I think the last call and the call before that whether or not when you are within 10 million units of either side of that type of TAM for the drive industry, now that\u2019s the things that the industry can manage pretty easily given the way we are producing. It\u2019s really the mix within that. That\u2019s more critical. And I think that just the architectural trends that we see one is the continued advancement of mobile technologies and then the network effect that, that has on where data is created and stored doesn\u2019t seem to us there would be any trend to break away from that. Hopefully, we are some of the new mobile products. You get an even greater network effect, because maybe there is more endpoints of people sharing which content, but the reason we kind of feel December is the same is the last five or six quarters is because we don\u2019t really see any big macro changes negative or positive and we don\u2019t really see any shifts away from the mobile and cloud future that we have been pretty solid on speaking to. So I think you are going to see relatively flat TAMs with the shift to increasing capacity per drive, which of course were the vertically integrated drive companies means absorption in heads and disc, which is good for us. And then the higher capacity drives of course are higher value-add technology as they are harder drives to making harder drives to test.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of (indiscernible) with BMO Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I had a question on hybrids and SSDs, in your Analyst Day you guys communicated that you guys would have about $100 million in hybrids and SSDs, can you provide an update on that for if you guys are still tracking that?","Steve Luczo","Yes, I would say we succeeded in those comments that we made previously. We are not given specific numbers on that, but we met or exceeded that comment that we made in the September analyst update.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. The question on the ASPs, it was down roughly 3% sequentially. And when I look at the product mix, your consumer electronics rose roughly flat and your hybrid shipments were much higher than we expected. So can you help us understand why ASPs were down 3, was there anything in terms of each products, where pricing was more aggressive or not?","Steve Luczo","Overall, the portfolio like I said was less than 2%. What you are seeing in ASP is much more mix adjusted on based on how the between segments. So if we take a look at the breakdown where the revenue came from, it was on a higher mix of I\u2019d say client drives versus then I mean the enterprise side. So it\u2019s all \u2013 what you are seeing is all affected by the market mix.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions from me. I guess first, when it comes to highest capacity drives that the cloud can buy, it's basically 4 terabyte correct, on the 3.5 inch form factor. I\u2019m just interested in what the next aerial density point is when we should see that and will you launch it on the cloud first?","Dave Mosley","We will probably will launch it on the cloud first, we won't make a product announcement today but you can imagine that if that segment is really demand in the capacity points we were talking about and we\u2019re looking hard on it.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Let\u2019s go peep into the fourth ladder, universe.","Dave Mosley","It's pretty competitive information Rich but we\u2019re not going to talk about what part of (indiscernible) we\u2019re putting inside of our devices.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay and then I guess within that range if you write about where the Exabyte growth is going and the industry's ability to fulfill it the supply chain we will need to invest as well, especially on the head side, but at the same time heads are one of those categories where one of your competitors buys almost all of their business. So I'm just interested in your views of the strategic levels of commitment that the head supplier has to you guys and your view of cutbacks in that area if you want to keep it more in-house.","Dave Mosley","Well, I think we have talked about this a little bit at the analyst day in New York. We\u2019re great partners with the external head vendor TDK and we don't foresee changing that going into the future. They have other customers obviously and what they do with those other customers kind of up to them. We will continue to maintain the technology and manufacturing synergies that we get with them going forward.","Rich Kugele - Needham & Company","Okay and then last question is just Pat, what should we be assuming from a share count perspective on a blended basis for the second quarter?","Pat O\u2019Malley","I think if you take a look at the December quarter based on what we have transacted with Samsung. It's is a 320 million for the actual shares and approximately 346 million for fully diluted and I just planned for that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Sterling with Barclays.","Eric Sterling - Barclays","Your competitor last week had talked about modest potential improvement on the PC side, I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are seeing anything to substantiate that looking at into the end of the year and into next year? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","Yes so I think right now we still see a pretty choppy situation among the different OEMs. There's clearly some that are still suffering and some that are doing better than the overall market segment and we look out to next year in early stages, we\u2019re hopeful with the new design, the OEMs are coming out with well to stimulate consumer demand but it's still just a pretty murky segment of the market and that's why I think we\u2019re very selective and cautious about how we continue to look at the client level of the marketplace.","Eric Sterling - Barclays","And any of the different view on the corporate PC side?","Steve Luczo","Yeah I think we\u2019re much more optimistic on the corporate PC side, and we have got a couple of initiatives that should bear a very positive fruit as we go into 2014 so we\u2019re much more optimistic on that side for sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rob Cihra with Evercore.","Rob Cihra - Evercore","Two questions I would like to ask one just real quick I guess for Pat with the OpEx do you think OpEx keeps increasing in dollar terms into the summer quarter I guess particularly with options but anything outside of the ordinary and then more sort of strategic product wise, can you tell us I know it's early but when you look at the ultra-mobile drive targeting tablet, where is the early OEM interest do you think most focus is it literally tablets or is it convertibles and is it going for using capacity or sure of bang to the buck as a differentiator or is it trying to kind of create a different looking part, I\u2019m just trying to see where the demand is there. Thank you very much.","Steve Luczo","So I will answer the first part and then I will hand it off to Rocky but in the first part, we are committed for the December quarter statement, 12% to 14% revenue range for OpEx and it\u2019s probably close to the high end as you said with options in our continued investment in cloud mobility. So it\u2019s probably at the higher end of that range for the December quarter. And then it should probably moderate after that and for Rocky to go through.","Rocky Pimentel","Yes, this is Rocky. So we have a number of OEM programs currently addressing the ultra-mobile class product that we announced back in September. One of the benefits of our design kit is the ability for the OEM to either buy the drive in a native format or buy it as a hybrid, which gives a lot of flexibility we provide the micro code in the mobile enablement kit according to what the OEM wishes to do, but certainly as we see 2014 unfold and this is where there could be a new pop in the consumer side of the business as the new form factor and design packaging comes out to be more of a convertible device that functions the benefits of both the tablet and the traditional notebook world. This is certainly something we think it stimulate consumer demand. And also commercial demand, we think that there will be some commercial platforms also introduced that better fit the enterprise environment. So we are actually very hopeful on the ultra-mobile side. And maybe Dave has got a couple more comments on that?","Dave Mosley","Yes. I guess the other thing I would say is that we are pretty confident in that 5-millimeter design point as being robust enough to handle it. And a lot of that will depend on the market adoption of those form factors, but it\u2019s still pretty slow, but over the next year we should see more and hopefully that\u2019s a compelling play out there in the notebook space.","Rob Cihra - Evercore","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Yes, thanks for taking the question. A couple if I can as well. I think in the past and I have not seen the supplemental commentary stuff yet, but I think in the past you have talked about the breakdown of your 8.1 million units that you have shipped in total enterprise between mission-critical and near line. Can you disclose that? And then also I am interested to understand what you view as your share position in the higher capacity point with the 4 terabyte solution starting to ship this last quarter? And I have a follow-up.","Pat O\u2019Malley","Hi, Aaron. This is Pat. I will answer the first part and I will let Rocky answer the high capacity. When we look at the products in the markets whether it\u2019s near line business critical and mission-critical, they are very similar in their technical applications and the customer sets. Therefore, we feel it\u2019s more appropriate to aggregate these for presentation purposes and we will continue to do that in the future. And Rocky, you could take the high capacity?","Rocky Pimentel","Yes. So, on the high capacity side, we actually gained some market share in the near line this last quarter with our 4 terabyte solution. We were admittedly a quarter or two late to market against the competition. We have gained our traditional market share in that category. And on the enterprise class products, we also gained this last quarter. So we are very happy with the performance of the upper end of the portfolio.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Okay. And then as my follow-up, just looking at the continued return of cash or free cash flow to shareholders, it looks like coming out of this quarter with a $32.7 million that you are spending on the shares of Samsung, we are already talking about $1.8 billion spend thus far this year. How do we take that in the context of the 90% cash flow from operations of return that you expect to do? And I think on top of that, are we still kind of sticking to the target of $250 million exiting calendar \u201814? I just want to be clear that those shares from Samsung aren\u2019t on top of that?","Steve Luczo","So we commit three-side turn, 70% of operating cash flow. And this puts us well in line to do that. For the rest of the shares for beyond this level, we don\u2019t view the \u2013 because of 382 rules now, we are going to view those as fairly synonymous going forward. So now, it\u2019s going to be a function of cash flow, but given when we have started this program and the stock is at 19, it\u2019s now going to be a function of the stock price and how we want to look at dividends and redemption of shares. So we will continue to monitor that and we will engage appropriately, but from our standpoint we are committed for the return on cash flow in the most efficient and effective way to our shareholders.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Okay. So the $1.5 million for the Samsung shares is inclusive or should be included in that 70% number?","Steve Luczo","That\u2019s correct.","Aaron Rakers - Stifel","Okay, thank you.","Steve Luczo","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","I just wanted to ask a little bit about your CapEx plans going forward I think historically you have had a goal of 6% to 8% of revenue for your CapEx, you have been well below that clearly with the market being relatively flat. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to increase that but just wanted to understand your views of spending for CapEx, what do you need to spend on? What do you think the industry is spending on and does that pick up at a new point? Thanks.","Dave Mosley","So yeah as we have talked about before we\u2019re still pretty much in line with 6% to 8% for this year although as we see that we have enough capacity online to meet the demands you know quarter-over-quarter we will sometimes pull the breaks a little bit and we did that starting a little bit last quarter so which as reflected in the CapEx numbers that we talked about. I think that we can replace equipment and keep our technology migrating along for something well under that 6% to 8% so occasionally from time to time we will pull back but we will be ready to go should we see upsides either heads, disks or drives as Exabyte march goes on.","Right now I\u2019m a little bit just concerned that that we won't see that for another year or so we pulled this last quarter.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","And then just thinking about the long term targets that you could have for the gross margins 27% to 32%, you guys are sort of at the lower end of that, how do we get to the higher end of that range what needs to happen? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I think Sherri it's really a function of again kind of relative growth of the cloud service providers again just because of the value associated with those drives and then really just macroeconomic traction I mean I think as long as the petabyte growth is where it's at, the industry does all right to maintain the margins because of the absorption, but I think really to push the industry you know let say above 30% I think it's probably going to take some overall growth. I think the world is still a bit cautious on maybe that plays into some of the things we talked about earlier in terms of what happens with the drives that are more targeted towards the mobile market that with the next-generation of products from OEMs could be compelling. You can get some Exabyte growth with HDD's in the markets that today are just purely SSDs. We have seen that even a little bit on the high-end notebook market that is all flash based or hybrid drives now represent about 20% of that market which is a market that I think year ago people would have said we wouldn\u2019t have anything of so. I think it just plays into a bunch of things but I think the real driver is going to be a better macro outlook with generate just you know a higher rate of global demand for storage both in terms of exabytes and units across the board.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","The big introduction of new SSDs was in May, I hope you can maybe talk through how the adoption has gone and maybe how you\u2019re competing there too with the relative mix of OEM versus channel and then maybe as a third point, what\u2019s the ultimate share opportunity within pure SSDs? Thanks.","Rocky Pimentel","We\u2019re still in the early stage of the SSD I think we were really pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance on SSDs obviously, making the comment that we did over a $100 million of solid stake related storage in the quarter tells you that you know our SSD business unit performed very well relative to a quarter-to-quarter performance. I think as we look out and actually look at this quarter\u2019s performance the unit is probably as big as anything that's been acquired recently by other companies. So we were very pleased with that, I think we\u2019re still working on our technology roadmap of the sustainable strategic advantages we can have in each of the key product portfolios so I don't know that we can now that we made a bold statement as to how much of a market share we\u2019re going to have but I think that we feel with our presence in our existing storage portfolio and the response we've been getting from our major accounts in both the cloud service area as well as the OEM area the opportunity is there for us to execute to have a pretty handsome share in the SSD market. But it's still early on and there is a lot of plays to be executed and a lot of competitive developments that are going to happen. So we have to go and attack it.","Steve Luczo","Yes, this is Steve. I mean, it\u2019s pretty dynamic right now. And we expect it will be over the next couple of years as all these different technologies play out in terms of which application spaces they are successful and then which kind of workload requirements are needed by which type of customer. I think for Seagate, certainly, we have always targeted the enterprise SAS market as one that we believe we have a competitive advantage in value-add as a result of our experience in the higher end compute market as it exist. Obviously, Hitachi has the same advantage. So I think relative to some of the other players that haven\u2019t been as exposed to those enterprise workloads as we have, the drive industry has kind of a natural advantage and I could see that those shares reflect what we see in the mission-critical space.","I think the SATA space gets a little more confusing just because it\u2019s currently under a lot of price pressure from the people that control media and then the PCI market space whether or not you call that storage or fast memory is also I think extremely challenged right now by a lot of competitors in the space. And while there is value-add to the software, the companies that are providing the media I think are making it difficult for anyone to really have an attractive margin there. So for us, we are really focused on enterprise SAS. That\u2019s where we think we have our best opportunity in the most capabilities and we were most excited about our partnership with Samsung. And the other areas, we will proceed with cautiously, but with the same mindset that we are really focused on margins here and want to make sure that we deploy something that we can sustain over a number of years with the competitive advantage.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Great overview, thanks. As my quick follow-up, Pat, with the sustainable or a go-forward quarterly interest expense, net interest expense number after the $1.5 billion goes out, that went out the door in October? Thanks.","Pat O\u2019Malley","So the interest expense, if you just talk pure interest expense, it\u2019s around $40 million to $45 million in that range. Obviously, if you are talking to net line over the interest income, the interest income is still going to be relatively low whether we have the cash or not, you are not getting much on your investment this day. So that won\u2019t marginally change. So I think if you are just looking for the interest expense model around $45 million and it will be okay.","Joe Wittine - Longbow Research","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your final question today comes from the line of Steven Fox at Cross.","Steven Fox - Cross","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. Just I was wondering if we can get some highlights around the branded business for the quarter whether just it look like it was up marginally from fiscal Q4 and sort of the outlook for the rest of the calendar year? And then secondly, just on the Kinetic announcement, probably don\u2019t understand the technology as well as I should, but from a go-to-market standpoint, your ability to commercialize this platform, can you just sort of talk about, I don\u2019t know if timeframe is relevant, but just sort of how you go about realizing revenues from this announcement? Thanks.","Rocky Pimentel","Yes, this is Rocky. I will take the branded one and then on Kinetic, I will turn it over to Dave. On branded, I would say, we were very pleased with the performance of the branded division. We succeeded in higher capacity drives in that category in the marketplace. There was legitimately a very challenging low end of the market price environment for branded, but despite that characteristic, our branded team did execute well against the market that made sense for our quality of business. So we are really pleased with that. Now having said that, there is a key product segment in the branded business, 2 terabyte that has been pretty successful in the marketplace for the last quarter or two and we are now shipping that product into the marketplace and that was not present to our September numbers in volumes. So we are optimistic about what we can continue to do on the branded side as we get to volume on our 2 terabyte products. So we will keep you posted on that. And I will turn over to Dave then for Kinetic.","Dave Mosley","Yes, Steven on the Kinetic announcement, it\u2019s really a development kit at this point in time, it\u2019s some electronics added to our print circuit board on our hard drives, not tremendously difficult to do, but the ecosystem that\u2019s outside of the drive isn\u2019t developed yet. So we need to get the product out so that people can get working on that development. As you know in the past, we have kind of spearheaded the changes whether it\u2019s SCSI or fiber channel or serial attached SCSI in the enterprise world to new interfaces and this is the same along that line. Although it's not a block based interface it's really a key value Ethernet interface if you will, and the largest reason that we did it was because well we have got a bunch of customers asking us for things like this, but what\u2019s happening what they see is that the objects themselves are being disaggregated in the blocks in order to be passed across the block based interfaces into the drive and that\u2019s costing money outside of that the disk drive whether it's software or silicon or whatever. So by virtue of us having this I mean expose this kind of interface to them then they can go and integrate without some of those added cost and the total cost ownership [ph] goes down. So we\u2019re pretty excited about it right now but you need everybody\u2019s else to go help develop that ecosystem outside the drive.","All right great. Thanks everyone. On behalf of the Seagate team we thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you so much for your participation.

Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today\u2019s call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I\u2019ll close the call with our outlook for the March quarter, as well as for the calendar year 2017.","Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered four consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin, and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter are combination of market demand trends across our high capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products, and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.","For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year.","HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments, and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter, and up 12% year-over-year.","We believe, Seagate\u2019s December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable, but mixed macroeconomic environment, as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw strong sequential demand for higher capacity products in the consumer, surveillance, and NAS markets.","Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter, with particular strength for our flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate\u2019s execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution on our cost reductions.","I\u2019d like to thank Seagate\u2019s employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities.","David Morton","Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate\u2019s business, there are few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve\u2019s earlier discussion.","For the December quarter, Seagate\u2019s addressable HDD market was in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter.","HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue skew.","Mission critical product sales remain stable and were up slightly, sequentially. HDD client high capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets, and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year, and PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.","Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented a certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $33 million in pre-tax restructuring charges.","The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In this short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year, operating expenses, excluding variable compensation have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year.","We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses, as we move through the fiscal year. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital, supporting the acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment, and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites.","Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.","Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $295 million ordinary shares outstanding.","Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our Board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5.","Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low-end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization, as well as Seagate\u2019s operational cost reductions.","From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts in the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we review that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential.","At the same time, we have structured our refreshed portfolio to optimize the gains in areal density improvement, increasing storage capacity per drive, and in turn this enables us to lower our build and material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest margin products across the portfolio.","While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high capacity and cost advantage products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of our fiscal and calendar year 2017.","Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around a higher-end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32%, and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY 2017.","I would now like to turn the call back to Steve.","Steve Luczo","Thanks, Dave. Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company\u2019s global operations. The ongoing shift from client server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base and high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics.","As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost optimized high capacity portfolio that is well-positioned in the consumer CE surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our one terabyte and higher products and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business critical product portfolio.","Our eight terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10 terabyte product in terms of quality, performance, and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12 terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation and the feedback has been positive.","During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from two to four terabyte products for certain applications up to 16 terabyte for other use cases.","From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit an exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally.","Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable and we will continue to drive the high capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than the last two years.","We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher-end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory under absorption, as we transition Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June.","Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of, at least, $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for our operating and financial performance in calendar 2018.","Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for questions. And our first question is from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Richard Kugele","First, can we just discuss a little bit more about the restructuring? Clearly, you\u2019ve made a lot of progress, those are all structural changes within Seagate. But can you just talk about how we should think about where Seagate excess calendar 2017, perhaps since that\u2019s the metric you\u2019re talking about from a maybe a COGS perspective or utilization if you want to look at that way, OpEx, is this the right level what we\u2019re seeing here for the March quarter exiting the year, how is the progress?","David Morton","Hi, Rich, this is Dave Morton, I\u2019ll tackle some of the OpEx ones and then turn it over to Dave Mosley to address some of the COGS and the improved efficiency there. I would take you back to middle of last year, where we had approximately two 8-Ks that we signaled upwards of $225 million of restructuring. We\u2019ve had a significant amount of that get recognized in the P&L, as we\u2019ve noticed on in the 8-K.","With that said, we haven\u2019t necessarily seen all the savings come through, and those are just on the activities that we\u2019ve announced thus far. And so, as you think about the OpEx, that\u2019s going to continue to trend down.","Now some of that\u2019s been masked a little bit by some of the variable compensation that\u2019s gone into the first-half. But we believe we\u2019re on a trajectory for that to continue to take steps down exiting not only the March, but continued into the back-half of the year. So that\u2019s our alignment right now. And then Dave in regards to\u2026","Dave Mosley","Yes, Rich, on COGS, it comes down to the utilization of our factories to first order, there\u2019s heads media and drive factories. And as we alluded to in the script, we\u2019re still in the consolidation phase on some of those. We have been for the last six months in earnest, but there\u2019s some work left to do.","So your question directly was at the end of this calendar year, I think, some of it has to do with our product transitions that we\u2019ll still be going through throughout this calendar year as far as whether we can stay full, but we\u2019re planning to, I think, and so we\u2019re planning to stay at the same utilization rates that we have today albeit with a little bit smaller footprint when those factories finally come offline.","Richard Kugele","Okay, thank you. And then just quickly on technology, 8 terabyte is your most important skew so far and revenues. But as you look at the balance of the year, do you see 10 terabyte really being adopted in size, or will people just move to the 12 that\u2019s in qual today?","Dave Mosley","That\u2019s a difficult question, I think.","Steve Luczo","Yes, just before we talk about it just so, I think one thing though, Rich, it\u2019s dangerous to conclude that it\u2019s all about 8s or 10s or 12s. I think what this quarter showed is, it\u2019s actually the breadth of the portfolio that matters. So, again, we had great results in the consumer space, the surveillance space, the NAS space, it\u2019s kind of all high capacity product for us and the profitability on the portfolio across the portfolio is quite significant. So I don\u2019t think you want to fall into a trap of thinking that it all comes from a terabytes, because that\u2019s not true.","And then I think, Rich, as we add the higher capacity points, clearly there\u2019s a value proposition for some customers who have those kinds of installs and see the TCO benefits from the really high capacity drive. I think a soon as we as the industry get the next one out, still tend to want to move to the next one as well.","So the 12s are out in evaluation that we\u2019ve been \u2013 for a a couple of quarters as we\u2019ve been talking about. And as we go to 2014 and 2016 and so on through the next year-and-a-half, I think, there\u2019s going to be continued motion here. Some people will stop at one that they\u2019re happy with who doesn\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t want to take the risk on the new or can\u2019t get the new one, there\u2019s going to be a lot of those dynamics I think for \u2013 over the course of the next six quarters.","Richard Kugele","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Ananda Baruah","Hey, thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Hey congratulations on the execution. Over the last nine months, it\u2019s been pretty impressive and the velocity has been pretty fantastic to see. I guess, just two quick ones for me. With regards to the sort of gross margin performance for the December Q and the ongoing sustainability of that, I \u2013 to what degree has the expansion \u2013 incremental expansion been from the capacity utilization action or the consolidation?","And then to what degree is it been and will remain from other factors you guys have talked about, maybe improving gross margin profile in the non-enterprise products the rest of the portfolio, Steve, as you mentioned and anything else, I just like to get a sense of a magnitude of what the improvement has been from, and then I have a quick follow-up? Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I think, if you\u2019re breaking it down between product refresh and mix, if you will in demand shifts that we believe are sustainable and restructuring. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably two-thirds on the product refresh so far, because not all of the restructuring is done. And so I think what we\u2019ll see is uplift from both as we continue, because we clearly expect the demand profile that continue to shift to the higher capacity points, that\u2019s why we\u2019re positioning the portfolio in the manufacturing footprint to support that, and of course, the manufacturing footprint will get more efficient.","Ananda Baruah","That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess, just a quick follow-up is, what is the current capacity utilization, or how you want to think about that? And it sounds like the \u2013 sort of the comments are you going to sustain that that, but what is the current way? Thanks a lot.","Steve Luczo","Yes, I think we have a number of different operational units, if you will, through our heads process or media process and our drive process, there\u2019s a number of different lines. But we\u2019re running anywhere from 80% to a 100%, depending on how you view those factories and we\u2019ll stay there. There will be some places necessarily in the supply chain, where we need flexibility. But we intend to stay at about these levels.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks, much appreciated.","Steve Luczo","But also just remember, you can\u2019t as soon as one factory is at capacity, you\u2019re at capacity.","Ananda Baruah","That makes sense.","Steve Luczo","Yes, because we need lots of parts to make a disk drive.","Ananda Baruah","Thank you. Good luck.","Steve Luczo","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. If I look at the guidance on a year-over-year basis, you\u2019re guiding to revenue growth for the first time. But the implication suggests that units still are declining maybe roughly 10% on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019m trying to understand what is the implication of the annual unit declines for the HDD industry? Are those declines offset on the utilization basis because of the mix to higher capacities? Do you still need to take some capacity offline, because typically, when we look at sort of the leverage that you get it\u2019s based on the the unit mix or the units improving, but we\u2019re not really seeing that right now?","Steve Luczo","Well, it\u2019s really components improving versus what\u2019s the unit, right? So units will probably be flattish to down slightly maybe, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of early to tell on that front, looks like this quarter unit demand was pretty good. I think for us, for sure, you remember, you always have to think about the market that we\u2019re focused on and which is what we\u2019re trying to get people understand that the Seagate addressable market is probably going to be diverging from what the other competitors think of as the market.","So for the market that we\u2019re in, we actually would say, that it\u2019s probably going to be a growing market, because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that obviously, because it\u2019s the highest capacity technology that we\u2019re using then it\u2019s lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with the units. Then as you know, going from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you\u2019re going from six to eight disk, at least, on the nearline products and we do think there\u2019s opportunities for more heads and disc on desktop and notebook, as people need higher capacity as well.","So I think from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good \u2013 better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you\u2019re asking. And no, we don\u2019t need a disk drive unit growth to drive factory absorption like we used to, because the demand profile now is all about high capacity drives not about lots of little drives that aren\u2019t connected that go into PCs.","Sherri Scribner","So that makes a lot of sense. I was just trying to understand the dynamics, because clearly now there needs to be more of a focus on revenue as opposed to the unit growth, which is what we used to look out before?","My second question would be, what is the implications for Seagate\u2019s business based on the administration changes we\u2019ve seen in the White House? I know, you guys are not incorporated in the U.S. But will you see any tax benefits potentially? How should we think about some of those changes, because we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about that. Thanks.","Steve Luczo","I\u2019ll let Dave talk about the tax implications in a second. I think from a usage perspective, we\u2019re encouraged that they will probably be a reacceleration of data acquisition systems, which had been stalled out fairly dramatically for the last several years. And I think the change in administration is probably going to result in some growth in that segment, which has been pretty stagnant for the last few years.","On the tax and regulation side, Dave Morton has done a lot of work there. So I\u2019ll let him answer that question.","David Morton","Thanks, Steve, and thanks, Sherri. Seagate does carefully monitor any and all potential tax law changes, not only here in the U.S., but in all areas of the globe, where we operate. We continue to evaluate the various proposals coming out of Washington to determine what their potential impact might be. And most of the proposals and process and in flight do contain certain provisions, which could have both positive and negative impacts to the company.","We do believe that the most serious tax proposals being considered, including the House Republican Blueprint with its border adjustability tax provision would not likely have a significant near-term impact for the company. But again, that\u2019s still under heavy review.","Sherri Scribner","Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next\u2026","Steve Luczo","Okay, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks, glad I made it through the line. I guess, maybe to start with the free cash flow usage, you guys have had really impressive free cash flow for the few quarters beyond dividend would seem to be a comfortable thing for you guys to do. How do you think about deleveraging versus potentially returning to the M&A framework?","Steve Luczo","Well, those are the things we think about. And I think, probably the best thing is to just look at what we\u2019ve done historically. I think, we \u2013 how do we think about it first and foremost whether or not it\u2019s dividends or buybacks. Number one thing we think about is, maintaining enough investment in our core business to maintain the technology platforms that we have and the leadership positions we have, the technology, as we mentioned, in the response to Sherri\u2019s question is it\u2019s getting more difficult, but these to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology.","So first and foremost, we make sure that we\u2019re covered on that front. And then, we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there\u2019s excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the Board has been fairly consistent and I expect to remain consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A.","So it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t think it constrained us \u2013 constrains us in anyway if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we want to go in. And then that\u2019s just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think, if you look at our history, we try to maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low-end of that range. And then what we do above that is probably buybacks opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value of the company is.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. And if I could just follow-up, you talked about being able to operate at the higher-end of your gross margin range for calendar 2017, what would enable you to operate at or above that range, because mix is only better and I think your manufacturing savings ahead of you?","David Morton","Yes, I mean, you\u2019re nailing both of them, right. We\u2019ve got through the March quarter and then extending into June in the back-half of the year. A lot of those savings will come to fruition on that top line, as well as some of the mix iterations and as we continue to ramp up the portfolio as well. So that\u2019s where we have a high degree of confidence in enabling that that sustainability in those levels at that margin range.","Amit Daryanani","Thank you.","Steve Luczo","Okay, great. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today, and particularly our customers and our suppliers and our employees and our investors obviously. We appreciate your support over the last year, and we look forward to speaking in the next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day."]}}
